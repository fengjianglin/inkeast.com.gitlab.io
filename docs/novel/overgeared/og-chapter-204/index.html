 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>20 blue-white energy blades flooded towards the ancient weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 It has come! The strongest skill! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The broadcast host shouted in a loud voice.&nbsp;</span><span style>The viewers’ hands became sweaty.&nbsp;</span><span style>Reinhardt's 100,000 users was thrilled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid felt joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The fusion skill ‘Transcended Link’ has increased a level.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Transcended Link Lv. 2]</span></p>
 <p><span style>You will temporarily be in a transcended linked state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A total of 20 strikes will be launched, dealing 180% attack power with each hit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every time a target is hit, they will be stiff for 0.1 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* This skill doesn’t share a cooldown with Transcend and Link.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Mana Cost: 1,600</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: 15 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was an exhilarating feeling the moment the skill level rose. He immediately felt stronger.&nbsp;</span><span style>The storm leapt from Grid towards the stiffened ancient weapon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Then there was one rotation of Kill.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Failure’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘5 Joint Attacks’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Holy Light Gloves’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘5 Joint Attacks’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 12,140,700 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Using repulsive force, there was another rotation and a second blow.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[The Holy Light Gloves’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘5 Joint Attacks’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 2,612,000 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The third blow.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 1,205,800 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fourth blow.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjeejeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 500,300 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fifth blow.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjeejeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[Failure’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘5 Joint Attacks’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Holy Light Gloves’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘5 Joint Attacks’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 5,579,000 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s basic stats were high and Toban’s buff also played a huge role.&nbsp;</span><span style>The stats that had risen dramatically, the strongest skill and the absolute power of his weapon, this trinity proved to be extremely powerful. Grid felt extreme pleasure at dealing more than 10 million damage in one blow.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tak.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid landed on the ground the moment that Transcended Link was finished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kukukukukung...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The ancient weapon became a complete rag.&nbsp;</span><span style>Shouts echoed from Reinhardt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Waaahhhhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid! Grid! Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hundreds of thousands of NPCs chanted Grid’s name. If it wasn’t for Grid, the king and royal family would’ve died and perhaps their kingdom would’ve been lost. For them, Grid was the hero of their kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Wiesbaden was thrilled to tears.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Thanks to the great hero, the 400 year history of the kingdom has been preserved...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The nobles were convinced as they saw it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Earl Steim will surely gain the title of duke.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘His son-in-law will at least be an earl...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The key person of the kingdom was now destined to become Earl Steim. The politically complicated nobles felt a grudge towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Truly God Grid! He’s on a different dimension! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The broadcasting anchors were very excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Today, we have learned one fact! Grid is the strongest! There is no doubt about it! This talent in the National Competition wasn’t just a bubble! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 In fact, it isn’t just Grid’s power. Grid absorbed the power of the Tzedakah Guild while everyone was watching. Today is an important day where the power dynamics of Satisfy will rapidly change. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 From Bairan Village to the present day... Grid is really becoming a legend. 』&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 He will be the first user to become an earl. How much power will he have as an earl? I’m already curious and excited. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Will it stop at just getting the title of an earl? In my opinion, it’s different... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>All six ancient weapons were humiliated.&nbsp;</span><span style>Soon, the golem invasion would end.&nbsp;</span><span style>Everyone believed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel spoke,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Grid, give us a signal so that we can finish the ancient weapon at the same time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ancient weapons had to be killed simultaneously. It would be seriously troublesome if the survivors evolved in real time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid nodded and shouted,&nbsp;</span><span style>“I will count to three. One! Two!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guild members concentrated their power.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were prepared to kill the ancient weapons the moment Grid countered to three.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, the moment that Grid counted to three!&nbsp;</span><span style>Each guild team made their final strikes against the ancient weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pon and Vantner were the problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will finish it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two people’s argument eventually caused an accident.&nbsp;</span><span style>The two people’s silly pride meant they struggled over who would deal the final blow, and eventually couldn’t finish off the ancient weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[High fire and lightning resistance are necessary.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Minerals that have high conductivity must be excluded from the body.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The body will become smaller by abandoning the massive minerals. It will restore the lost agility.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The firing rate of magic power should be increased.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Instead of lowering the power of the mana, rebuild the magic circles so that it is dispersed better.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Tolerance to edged tools should be increased.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Tolerance to explosions should be increased.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[It is determined that flying ability should be acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Clink!</span></i> <i><span style>Clink clink.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The ancient weapon was only partially destroyed by Mach Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style>It started rebuilding its body based on the information left behind by the deaths of the other five ancient weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was like a cube.&nbsp;</span><span style>The 8m tall body was repeatedly folded and stretched. Then light flashed and it had a new appearance.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Grrr.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The transformed ancient weapon looked like a soul doll.&nbsp;</span><span style>It had a height of 2m.&nbsp;</span><span style>The body resembled that of a human.&nbsp;</span><span style>At first glance, it seemed weaker, but that was only the outer appearance. The presence felt from it was unusual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you crazy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, are your brains working? What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guild members scolded Pon and Vantner. The situation became like this because of their futile pride, so the atmosphere cooled.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pon and Vantner thought they had to make up for their mistakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We will handle this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will clean up my shit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two people cooperated for the first time in ages. They held their weapons in a serious manner and rushed to the evolved ancient weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it was useless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why has its defense increased so much when its size is smaller?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon and Vantner’s spear and axe didn’t do much damage to the evolved ancient weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style>The ancient weapon seemed to laugh at the two people and raised a finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What did this mean?&nbsp;</span><span style>The two people were dumbfounded by the actions of the ancient weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then two rays of magic power were fired at their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 18,010 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Healing effects will be reduced.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner lost 30% of his health despite his legendary rated armor. Then what about Pon, who was a damage dealer?</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered serious damage!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You can’t regain your mental state.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Healing effects will be reduced.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon lost 60% of his health at once and became stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style>The evolved ancient weapon was approaching him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon turned pale. The ancient weapon head-butted him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hope!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee urgently used her healing skill, but the healing effect was reduced due to the debuff. He was on the verge of dying.&nbsp;</span><span style>The guild members came out to save him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban stood in front of him and used a defense skill, while Jishuka, Laella and Zednos attacked from the rear. The damage dealers, led by Regas and Faker, immediately cast their ultimate skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The evolved ancient weapon exerted overwhelming power. The Anti-magic Shield it unfolded defeated all magic while avoiding Jishuka’s arrows at the same time. Then it dealt great damage to Regas and Faker. Finally, the magic power rays were fired everywhere and casualties followed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...It’s the end.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner thought it was over. He felt guilty when watching his colleagues be hurt because of him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Someone placed a hand on his shoulder.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a large, powerful and trustworthy hand.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was full of calluses, like the hand of a warrior or a blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Grid’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sorry...!”&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner couldn’t lift his head. He didn’t blame Grid for resenting him. But Grid was smiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Didn’t I tell you? I will be your strength.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The day he asked the Tzedakah Guild to come under him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had asked them to be his strength. He also vowed to be their strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was prepared to defend that promise now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He has changed again.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner and the guild members were very shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was surprising that Grid, who normally hated any losses, had matured even further.&nbsp;</span><span style>As everyone watched, Grid summoned the worst pet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the best demonic beast of hell.&nbsp;</span><span style>He appeared with shining eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Will you give me something delicious today? Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Perhaps. It might be the most delicious prey you’ve ever eaten.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason that Grid hadn’t summoned Noe during the battle was because of jealousy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe had far more fans than him. So if Noe played an important role in public, Grid was afraid that his popularity would be completely overshadowed. Therefore, Grid was determined to end this battle with his own strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he was unable to measure the combat strength of the evolved ancient weapon. Grid predicted it was at the same level as Hell Gao who had been weakened twice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had just used Transcended Link and Linked Kill, so it wasn’t an enemy he could face right now.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was forced to depend on Noe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The fan cafe numbers will go up again...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid swallowed his regret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Swallow it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nyaang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe flew away immediately.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he opened his mouth and swallowed the evolved ancient weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The memphis has taken part of the target’s soul.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[There will be a 50% decline in the target’s main stats for 3 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The stats taken from the target will be transferred to the master.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Stamina has increased by 2,133.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship! Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was lucky.&nbsp;</span><span style>A critical, as well as the option effects of Failure and the Holy Light Gloves were applied.&nbsp;</span><span style>The ancient weapon’s health and defense was greatly reduced, so it was forced to suffer great damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>The guild members unleashed their offensive towards it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In particular, Euphemina used the S-grade magic that she saved.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaaaaah! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The ancient weapon resisted as much as it could. But the minimum level of the Overgeared Guild members was 270. The one with the lowest level was Grid. The evolved ancient weapon continued to be swallowed by Noe and couldn’t endure their onslaught for long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee’s level kept rising continuously while using the wide-area heal. It was great for Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the ancient weapon finally died.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>As it died, it dropped an item called ‘Braham’s Message.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Braham...! Is he the cause of this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wanted to read the message right away. But he had to put it off for a while. King Wiesbaden himself was running over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Thank you! Thank you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The king grabbed Grid’s hands and shouted.&nbsp;</span><span style>He reigned as the absolute person since his birth, so it was amazing to see him bow his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now only the rewards were left.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid headed to the palace with the Overgeared Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reporters tried to follow to relay the situation, but they were stopped by the guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel gave Grid advice.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Grid, you should ask the king to allow them to come. We need to inform the world about how much you and the Overgeared Guild has grown from today’s achievement. This is an opportunity to make everyone look up to us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was Grid’s adviser. Grid had never once suffered damage from his words.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Thus, he accepted Lauel’s advice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King’s Wiesbaden gratitude to Grid’s group was relayed to the world in real time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s reputation skyrocketed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the first time that Director Yoon Sangmin of the S.A. Group reacted positively to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, this is like a legendary class.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The activities of a unique existence that caused a positive influence.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was delighted that many users would want to be Grid and would play Satisfy even harder.</span></p>
