 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The shortest distance from Reidan to Titan was via Viscount Welkun’s territory.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid headed there through Earl Zebra’s territory. It was a huge delay of 10 days, but he didn’t mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Lauel told me to stop here and get the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Do so through any means, he had added.&nbsp;</span><span style>It meant the item called the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch had great value.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Slaughterer.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to Lauel, the Slaughterer was an inhabitant of Earl Zebra’s underground area.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Zebra’s hobby was the torture and gruesome killing of half human, half beast species.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But it was impossible to control.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Half human, half beast. Depending on the circumstances of this species’ growth, they could be either human or beast.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a natural result that one of them would become an evil beast from Earl Zebra’s brutal actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will know what type of person he is when we meet.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid focused on hunting for four days and decreased his infamy, allowing him to move on.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is a bad place.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Zebra’s castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entrance was exceptionally dark and desolate, reminding Grid of the entrance to a dungeon. It felt like once he entered, he wouldn’t be able to get out again. It was a very bold person who would be able to step in here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Grid didn’t feel any fear. He went forward without any hesitation. As his self-esteem grew, he became less cowardly. He wasn’t the same as the person who used to pee at the sight of ghosts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldiers guarding the gate looked at Grid suspiciously. The person was wearing a deep hat that covered his face.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid took off the hat.&nbsp;</span><span style>His dignity stat was over 1,500 points and he had 25,000 continent reputation, so he was extremely influential.&nbsp;</span><span style>The soldiers seemed to see a halo around Grid. They felt a baseless confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where do you come from?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldiers misunderstood Grid as a high-ranking noble of the empire and became polite.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was a familiar transformation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t feel much from it and responded with a nonchalant expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I came to fight against the Slaughterer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok.”&nbsp;</span><span style>The soldiers gulped.&nbsp;</span><span style>This person would fight against the fearsome Slaughterer!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Furthermore, by himself?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The others all tried to bring more companions...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you serious?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldiers asked with disbelieving expressions and Grid nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Hrmm."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Zebra’s body weighed 0.1 tons.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t pleasant to look at his belly fat and greasy face.&nbsp;</span><span style>He stroked his droopy chin and looked at Grid before speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Zebra was competent and ordinary. He had no apparent talents. He became an earl because he inherited it from his father, just as his father did.&nbsp;</span><span style>But his eyes were good at looking at people. He often mingled with high-ranking nobles in the social circles, so he could feel the dignity coming from the other person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his view, Grid had a dignity compared to the royal family.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘However, he isn’t any royal member that I know.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the first place, why would royalty come to this area to try and fight a monster? The royal family were like gods in this world, so it was natural for them to pursue safety.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Royalty from a foreign kingdom?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid replied to Earl Zebra.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I am someone who will solve your problem. Isn’t that enough?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was truly a cheeky tone.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Zebra didn’t like it, as well as the fact that Grid didn’t disclose his identity. But he didn’t feel the need to dwell on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Anyway, he will die.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Slaughter had evolved into an evil beast half a year ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>Like every day, Earl Zebra was torturing and killing somebody when a man watching the scene suddenly trembled and transformed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now an uncontrollable monster lived under the castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was serious.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Zebra was keen to defeat it.&nbsp;</span><span style>He used the most powerful knights and magicians in his family, hired top-ranking mercenaries and even recruited adventurers.&nbsp;</span><span style>But in the end, he failed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So far, the number of people who had attempted to defeat the Slaughterer was over 800, and all 800 of them had died.&nbsp;</span><span style>That Slaughterer was strong.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, there was a problem with the environment.&nbsp;</span><span style>The basement was narrow and the Slaughterer was large.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The maximum number of people allowed in the basement was three.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the crucial reason why the strongest knights and magicians in his family couldn’t kill the Slaughterer.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was impossible for only three people to get rid of the Slaughterer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the black-haired man in front of him was alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kukukuk. Yes, yes. I understand. It doesn’t matter who you are. Just please fix my problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The knights had already been killed by the Slaughterer.&nbsp;</span><span style>Four days later, reinforcements from the Red Knights would arrive.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Zebra wasn’t expecting anything from Grid, so he spoke vaguely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then a quest window appeared in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Fight the Slaughterer]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Difficulty: S+</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, Earl Zebra found a half man, half beast species from the slave market and purchased it. He enjoyed playing with his toy in the basement of the castle as he tortured them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But eternal joy doesn’t exist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zebra became bored of torturing stupid monsters who couldn’t speak the language, and became addicted to torturing the ‘good humans.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He framed innocent people, made them prisoners, dragged them under the castle, tortured them, then killed them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The half man, half beast watched this every day and became frightened, finally showing self-protective instincts. He opened the strength of an evil beast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Slaughterer has been subjected to numerous tortures and has the ability to grasp humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He is strong and dangerous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He will become a great disaster someday if left unchecked now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Conditions: Slaughterer’s death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Rewards: Black Quartz Earrings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Failure: Level -6. Reputation throughout the continent - 1,000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘S+.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It meant it was extremely difficult compared to S-grade quests.&nbsp;</span><span style>He heard that the number of participants who could participate in this quest was only three.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Lauel said that the Slaughterer can’t be defeated unless Pon, Regas and Faker formed a team.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I think you can clear it alone.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was always a reasonable person. Grid could trust his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldiers guided Grid down to the basement. They walked down a narrow staircase for three minutes before arriving in front of an iron door that was firmly closed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“O-Over here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of the Slaughterer breathing could be heard, so a soldier opened the lock with trembling hands. Then the soldiers ran away before the iron door opened.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was left alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No matter how strong, you must be weaker than Hell Gao.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had experience fighting against the strong evil aura of Hell Gao, a great demon.&nbsp;</span><span style>He acquired two new sword techniques.&nbsp;</span><span style>His control skills were rapidly rising due to Noe and Randy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was in his strongest state since starting Satisfy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The greatness he showed the world at the National Competition? The Grid at that time was nothing compared to the current Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Step step.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid listened to the sound of his footsteps echoing in the basement.&nbsp;</span><span style>The sound of the Slaughterer also entered his ears.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuoooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Slaughterer’s appearance was horrible and sad.&nbsp;</span><span style>His skin was peeled off and rusted metal pieces were embedded deeply inside his body. There were also pieces of flesh out of place.&nbsp;</span><span style>These were signs of Earl Zebra’s torture.&nbsp;</span><span style>His face couldn’t be identified because he was wearing a mask, but he had an eye patch and only one eyeball.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Poor fellow. I will kill you quickly so that you don’t suffer anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid pulled out two greatswords.&nbsp;</span><span style>A blue greatsword in his right hand and a jade greatsword in his left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The +9 Failure has been equipped. Due to the effect of orichalcum, your damage has risen by 30% in this dark place.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The +8 Doppelganger’s Greatsword has been equipped. One 50% of the weapon’s attack power is applied due to the double wielding penalty.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuaaaaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Slaughterer roared.&nbsp;</span><span style>When it saw the weapons, it was reminded of its nightmarish days of being tortured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The cry of the Slaughterer has caused fear.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The persistent eyes of the Slaughterer will penetrate through your weaknesses.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kung kung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Slaughterer rushed with its massive body. Then it randomly swung its weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How crude.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had fought Randy, who copied Pagma’s power, a total of 83 times.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, the Slaughterer couldn’t pose a threat compared to the Randy.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chengkang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The jade greatsword blocked off the path.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The blue greatsword pierced the heart of the Slaughterer.&nbsp;</span><span style>The thing that should be noted here was that it wasn’t one strike.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid smashed the flesh of the Slaughterer with his weapons.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Slaughterer cried like a child struggling with pain.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid cut the lower part of the Slaughterer with the jade greatsword while he used Pinnacle with the blue greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>The blue greatsword fell like a thunderbolt towards the Slaughterer’s chest.&nbsp;</span><span style>The rotten blood mixed with pus splattered out and covered one wall of the basement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Slaughterer was filled with rage.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why did he have to always suffer like this? He didn’t want to be born a monster!&nbsp;</span><span style>The Slaughterer seemed to be crying out.&nbsp;</span><span style>As hiss weapon fell towards Grid’s head...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Randy appeared in the shape of Grid and used Revolve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s finish this.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suuuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Seven blades spread out in the air.&nbsp;</span><span style>The golden blades shone brilliantly in the dark basement and poured towards the Slaughterer.&nbsp;</span><span style>Noe was also active.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'm going to eat! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The huge mouth swallowed up the Slaughterer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Strength has increased by 1,831.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was reinforced by the stats received from Noe, and used Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Linked Kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The option effect of the Doppelganger’s Greatsword was applied, giving him a 20% increase in his skill damage. In addition, the ‘Five Joint Attack’s option effect of Failure and the Holy </span><span style>Light Gloves were activated. Therefore, Link Kill was reborn a his strongest skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have killed the Slaughterer.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[108,950,109 experience has been acquired.] One-third of this will each be distributed equally to Noe and Randy.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Slaughterer’s Eye Patch &nbsp;has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Slaughterer’s Mask has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Three weapon enhancement stones have been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A Blessed Weapon Enhancement Stone has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Slaughterer’s eternal pain ended.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid appraised the items that were dropped and understood why Lauel told him to come here.</span></p>
