 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The mountain of gold coins was close to a height of 4m.&nbsp;</span><span style>During the three minute time limit, how much could the Overgeared members obtain?&nbsp;</span><span style>The result of adding up the amounts they obtained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"21 million gold."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok! Really?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wow, terrific."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grid did it again! This is amazing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>21 million gold!&nbsp;</span><span style>When converted to Korean money, it would be around 25.5 billion won.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was close to half the salaries of the world’s top sports players.&nbsp;</span><span style>The impressed Pon asked Vantner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“At the time of the Vasco raid, how much profit did Seuron get?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two months before the Reidan invasion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Soul Predator Seuron went through Vasco’s Labyrinth with his guild members.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner had watched it in real time, so he pulled up his memories.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Adding up the value of the Brutal Heavy Sword, it was about 8 million gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid got nearly three times that amount alone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strictly speaking, this time it wasn’t alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>If it was Grid alone, he wouldn’t have been able to pick up 200,000 gold by hand.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was true that he raided Pascal through his own efforts, choices and abilities. His decision to summon the knights was admirable.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s achievements couldn’t be downplayed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grid, you're the best.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Of course our master should be the best.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Congrats on becoming a rich man!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members praised Grid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>They sincerely congratulated him for the huge sum of money, and rejoiced as if it was their own.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was no jealousy or envy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their respect and friendship with Grid wasn’t cheap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kilkil.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members were excited, producing a cheerful atmosphere.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Grid was silent.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members thought he was so happy that he was at a loss for words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it was a misunderstanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was sincerely angry. He was speechless because it was ridiculous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why? Why isn’t it one trillion?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The amount of gold coins that Grid had seen in the warehouse was beyond imagination.&nbsp;</span><span style>He thought it would be at least one trillion won.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yet he only got 21 million gold?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is ridiculous! We carried out most of the gold coins in the warehouse before it exploded! Countless gold coins were kept! But why? Why is it only 21 million gold!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who would use the word ‘only’ for 21 million gold?&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members fell silent at this unexpected reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's a scam! A scam!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel explained to the furious Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The explosion was so strong that it affected the outside of the building. At that time, a lot of gold coins were lost. In addition, there were many gold coins that were damaged after being hit by a skill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gold coins that were damaged slightly were always destroyed. It seemed to be some type of safety device designed by the S.A Group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dammit!”&nbsp;</span><span style>The damaged gold coins were designed to be destroyed and the warehouse to explode?&nbsp;</span><span style>“You bastards!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It couldn’t resist angrily screaming out curses.&nbsp;</span><span style>After losing his temper, the only person who could completely calm him down was Lauel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t 21 million gold a huge amount? In fact, the S.A. Group must be more baffled right now. They never imagined that we could get so many gold coins in just three minutes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could they imagine that he would use the skill Summon Knight for gold coins?&nbsp;</span><span style>They might’ve predicted that Grid could only obtain up to one million gold.&nbsp;</span><span style>The result was that Grid had hit the S.A. Group in the back of the head. Grid should be the one feeling invigorated.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid didn’t get any comfort from this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit! Dammit! The gold coins could at least be melted down and made into metal, so why were they destroyed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It does seem to be the case.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members started to sympathize with Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The S.A. Group’s effort to fight inflation wasn’t so well received.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were more than two billion users in Satisfy. If the NPCs were included, billions of people used the same currency. The possibility of the value of currency falling was extremely low.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid and the group left the Vatican.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You said you were going to Winston?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sigh... Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I thought so. You should show your face to your wife.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isn’t she pregnant?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The childcare system and a prince maker, I am envious. It would be fun to raise a child."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Umm... Grid Junior. Umm...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid regained control once the story of Irene and his child emerged.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t lose his composure so easily when he was going to become a father.&nbsp;</span><span style>After a moment of consideration, he handed Lauel 20 million gold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s use this money for Reidan’s development fund. If all of you weren’t here in the first place, I wouldn’t have been able to obtain so much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel and the Overgeared members were greatly amazed.&nbsp;</span><span style>They never dreamed that Grid would be willing to invest the money into the territory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t I incompetent because I do nothing as a lord? I should at least give you money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid should originally be the one working the hardest for Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>But what was the reality?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid &nbsp;didn’t fulfill his obligations as the lord, and the Overgeared members were suffering from all types of problems.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was always sorry and thankful about this fact. He wanted to help with the development of the estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If Reidan develops, the benefits will return to all of us in the end. Isn't that right?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your words are correct.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The development of Reidan would make Overgeared strong. This would be a stepping stone to build Grid’s kingdom and would bring enormous wealth to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>20 million gold couldn’t be compared to that huge amount of money.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid already knew this. That’s why he decided to invest in Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"By the time you come back, Reidan will be more developed than before. Look forward to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This 20 million gold was enough to invigorate Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Once the yellow mithril mine was activated and the alchemy business expanded, Reidan would become one step closer to its goal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The second Talima!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Talima.&nbsp;</span><span style>A city of dwarves that produced the best battle gear.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it was in the territory of the dragon Trauka, so it was off limits to humans.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Reidan could one day compete with Talima...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel’s brain turned quickly.&nbsp;</span><span style>He kept in mind the merger with the Silver Knights Guild and made plans for Reidan’s development.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"This is the first time we have walked together alone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y-Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying goodbye to Lauel’s group.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid and Jishuka were heading to Winston.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gulp!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid couldn’t help gulping through the journey.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was a very natural phenomenon.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t help appreciating Jishuka’s beautiful face and great body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid is looking at me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka was conscious of Grid’s eyes and deliberately walked like a model.&nbsp;</span><span style>She showed a gentle gait that emphasized the curves of her body.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gulp!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid couldn’t resist staring at her swaying hips.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was unavoidable.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka’s busty body was perfectly to Grid’s taste.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the same with her personality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s camp here today. Excuse me... Grid, can I use your arm as a pillow?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huhu, Grid’s body is so solid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A provocation woman by night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will cook.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh my, Grid. Shouldn’t you watch where you are going? You should focus on hunting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I am embarrassed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A mild-mannered woman during the day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going crazy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s appreciation towards Jishuka rose exponentially.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was seriously considering buying a ‘Love Potion’ from the Reputation Store that would reset the penalty once a month.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Jishuka had no intention of allowing that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There is no point in Satisfy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was already married to Irene. She couldn’t be a concubine.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was appropriate to convey her true heart in reality.&nbsp;</span><span style>Right now, she was just acting to stimulate Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to that, Grid was suffering.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to quickly see Irene.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Just before arriving in Winston.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid promised to meet Jishuka six hours later and logged out.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because he received a call from Sehee outside the capsule.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you call?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid exited the capsule and bluntly asked Sehee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A guest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He saw that it was 11 a.m.&nbsp;</span><span style>A Sunday morning.&nbsp;</span><span style>What guest would come at a time when families should be together?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid tilted his head. No, Youngwoo went out into the living room.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he panicked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Y-Yura?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura was sitting on the sofa and smiling while chatting with his parents.&nbsp;</span><span style>She looked particularly beautiful.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her neat charm was the best.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Jishuka’s beauty 100% matched his tastes, Yura had a beauty that made his taste meaningless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo admired Yura’s beauty before recovering his spirit.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was due to his mother’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Youngwoo, what are you staring at? Come and sit down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid awkwardly sat on the couch.&nbsp;</span><span style>His parents were sitting side by side on one sofa, so Youngwoo naturally sat beside Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style>A nice scent tickled his nose.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura asked for understanding from his parents and said to Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Please buy me a meal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo was confused by the sudden request.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Why are you suddenly asking me to buy you a lot of food? Can’t you buy food for yourself? No, how did you hear that I made money?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This witch had come for his money!&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura was different from the Overgeared members.&nbsp;</span><span style>She helped him a lot, but he was still wary of her. It wasn’t enough to be considered a friend yet.&nbsp;</span><span style>His parents noticed Yura’s sad expression and scolded him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can you talk that way to a guest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Youngwoo, we taught you better.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura was pretty, talented, and had a lot of money.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo’s parents wanted her to be their daughter-in-law.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You don’t know that her nickname is Blood Witch.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A murderer who hurt people without changing her facial expression!&nbsp;</span><span style>The impression from his first meeting still wasn’t erased from his brain.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo sighed and got up from his seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let's go."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo didn’t care about washing up. He was still dressed in sweats that had food splattered on them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo’s mother tried to convince him to change, but Yura didn’t care.&nbsp;</span><span style>She thought that Youngwoo not caring about impressing others was attractive.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>A restaurant near his house.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What's going on?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura observed the inside of the shabby restaurant while Youngwoo ordered two servings of bulgogi rice.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura extended a passbook to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is the broadcast fee from OGC Station.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t expect much of a broadcast fee.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo didn’t understand why Yura had it, but he was happy about receiving money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I should go to a restaurant tonight for a celebration.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would eat a big meal. Bean sprouts as well. A lot of monkfish!&nbsp;</span><span style>He thought it was millions of won, but his eyes bugged out when he opened the passbook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Eh...? Eek!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a huge amount.&nbsp;</span><span style>A huge 500,000 mi...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, it is 5 billion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura explained to the astounded Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Some of it was withheld as tax.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“N-No, why is it so much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It is my ability.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t arrogance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura was just telling the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why are you doing this for me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura answered Youngwoo’s question without hesitation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>She had a busy life, so time was valuable to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please let me join Overgeared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo didn’t hesitate. Collecting talent was his desire and Yura was a better talent than anyone else.&nbsp;</span><span style>Wasn’t she 5th on the unified rankings?&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a private ranker, Youngwoo wasn’t interested in the ranking system and didn’t yet know that Yura had disappeared from the rankings list.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Welcome!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two people ate the delicious bulgogi meat.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura had a happy expression throughout the meal.&nbsp;</span><span style>People who knew her would be surprised.</span></p>
