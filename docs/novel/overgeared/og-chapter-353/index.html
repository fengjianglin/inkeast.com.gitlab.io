 <hr>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>[You have been hit by a lethal blow!]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The durability of the White Clouds Clothing (Unique) has decreased by 15.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The durability of the White Clouds Footwear (Unique) has decreased by 21. There is a risk of damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The durability of the White Fang (Legendary) has decreased by 9.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[You won’t die in sparring mode. Your health has fallen to the minimum, so sparring mode is finished!]</span></p>
 <p><span>Kraugel had been reigning at the top since Satisfy opened.&nbsp;</span><span>He was praised for being the sky above the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I lost.’</span></p>
 <p><span>It was just after he fought Piaro and he had many disadvantages, so was this the cause of his defeat?&nbsp;</span><span>It was flimsy.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I lost to his efforts.’</span></p>
 <p><span>There were no excuses.&nbsp;</span><span>If he made excuses every time he tasted frustration, the present Kraugel wouldn’t have existed.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Shaaaaaah</span></em><span>-</span></p>
 <p><span>Was it mourning for the broken sky?&nbsp;</span><span>Dark clouds formed in the blue sky and rain poured down.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Ku...ock!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Kraugel exchanged looks with Grid as blood flowed from his body. He was about to fall when Grid caught up.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Be careful.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“You’ll die if you fall from this height.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid used more strength while bluntly speaking. He was tired, so it was difficult to control his body.&nbsp;</span><span>Kraugel laughed as his head rested on Grid’s neck.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I’m thankful that you saved my life.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"Of course. You would’ve lost your experience if it wasn’t for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"...Yes, thanks to you, I’m able to keep my number one ranking.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"Protect that position until I take it from you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"It means I will have to play the game for 100 years.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"...It won’t take that long.”</span></p>
 <p><span>After decreasing his body fat through constant exercise, Grid showed off his good frame, as well as his thick eyebrows and high nose.&nbsp;</span><span>Once he entered his late 20’s, he was able to look more mature and gave off a manly charm.</span></p>
 <p><span>On the other hand, Kraugel was a man with a neutral type of charm. He was beautiful with stubborn eyes, fine skin, red legs, and well styled black hair.&nbsp;</span><span>The two men leaning against each other while landing on the ground gave women a strange stimulus.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘It’s to the extent that I feel jealous.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Jishuka couldn’t help laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Now I am being pushed by a man.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Yura was frustrated.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I would rather see Oppa with a man rather than a woman...’</span></p>
 <p><span>Ruby had dangerous thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span>The two men, Grid and Kraugel, descended safely and stared at each other for a moment, while they were watched by the Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Can I win if we fight again?’</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I don’t want to turn him into an enemy.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid felt awe towards Kraugel. The jealousy caused by an inferiority complex was completely erased.&nbsp;</span><span>Was it the leisure of a winner?&nbsp;</span><span>It wasn’t such a simple concept.&nbsp;</span><span>This was pure respect.&nbsp;</span><span>He was driven to the defensive by Kraugel, who had a normal class.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid was glad to meet him.</span></p>
 <p><span>Kraugel also had similar feelings to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid had the best talent, despite not inheriting talent from the heavens. Kraugel felt respect for Grid, who put in effort to overcome everything he had endured over the years.</span></p>
 <p><span>Kraugel asked,&nbsp;</span><span>"How do you have time to grow despite your status, family, and colleagues?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid asked in return.&nbsp;</span><span>“Is it possible for a person to grow alone? I can’t do that.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"...I think the concept of growth that I am talking about is different from your concept of growth. But, well, I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Kraugel accepted it and stood up.&nbsp;</span><span>The rain stopped and the sun appeared again.&nbsp;</span><span>A smile appeared on Kraugel’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It looks good.”</span></p>
 <p><span>People crowded around the wounded Grid.&nbsp;</span><span>They were the famous rankers belonging to Overgeared, baby Lord, Ruby, and Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span>Dozens of people were only looking at Grid. Looking at their worried and proud eyes, Kraugel was able to see how much they cared about Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span>He wanted to be the best. So he had to get ahead of anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Alone, quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid became a new inspiration to Kraugel, who always isolated himself.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I will see you again one day.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Then Grid caught up to Kraugel, who was trying to leave alone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>"Stop by the smithy. I will repair your items.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"I don’t want to owe more than this.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"Aren’t you going to pay for the cost of the repairs? So it isn’t a debt. Come on, let's go.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"...”</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>“What happened?”&nbsp;</span><span>Jishuka asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>How did the 1st ranked Kraugel come to Reidan and how did he face Grid?&nbsp;</span><span>Jishuka and the Overgeared members wondered about the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span>“That...”</span></p>
 <p><span>Piaro explained honestly.&nbsp;</span><span>The Overgeared members were filled with anticipation after finding out the whole story.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Kraugel is a close brother to Piaro?’</span></p>
 <p><span>'Hopefully this...’</span></p>
 <p><span>'Is it possible for Kraugel to join Overgeared?’</span></p>
 <p><span>If so, it was a jackpot.&nbsp;</span><span>The power of Overgeared would jump by leaps and bounds.</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>[+8 White Clouds Clothing]</span></p>

 <p><span>Clothing that the people of the East Continent enjoy.</span></p>
 <p><span>The appearance is plain, but its functionality isn’t.</span></p>
 <p><span>The blue leopard’s fur woven into the silk material gives it excellent defense and durability.</span></p>
 <p><span>Weight: 411</span></p>
 <p><span>User Restriction: Level 300 or higher. White Swordsman, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssaurabi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saurabi</a>, spiritualist, daoist, etc.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>* There is a 5~15% reduction in skill cooldown time.</span></p>
 <p><span>* The effect of movement skills will increase by 10 + 4%.</span></p>
 <p><span>...</span></p>
 <p><span>...</span></p>
 <p><span>The smithy.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid was convinced when looking at Kraugel’s equipment.</span></p>
 <p><span>'Saurabi, spiritualist, daoist... Just like this continent mimics the culture of the west, the East Continent must be based on oriental culture.'</span></p>
 <p><span>The appearance of the clothing was very similar to those worn in the Joseon Dynasty.</span></p>
 <p><span>Also.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘It’s like Pagma’s attire.’</span></p>
 <p><span>It might be the case. No, there was a high probability that he needed to visit the East Continent.&nbsp;</span><span>But how?&nbsp;</span><span>As Grid played Satisfy, he constantly heard talk about the East Continent. Even the explanation of Piaro’s Supreme Swordsmanship mentioned the East Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid learned something in the process.&nbsp;</span><span>In order to reach the East Continent, he had to cross the Dead Sea.&nbsp;</span><span>Beyond the Dead Sea?&nbsp;</span><span>It was impossible to enter the East Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘How was Kraugel able to enter the East Continent?’</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid was curious. He wanted to ask Kraugel about this.&nbsp;</span><span>But he didn’t open his mouth.&nbsp;</span><span>What did Kraugel have to do to reach the East Continent?&nbsp;</span><span>Grid didn’t want to be the impertinent person who asked for such high value information.&nbsp;</span><span>This was also his pride.</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid repressed his curiosity and asked,&nbsp;</span><span>“The set item effect? Take out the other two. I will repair the whole set.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“This is all.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"...Do you mean you were only wearing three pieces of armor when fighting me?”</span></p>
 <p><span>In fact, it was two pieces.&nbsp;</span><span>He didn’t wear the gloves.&nbsp;</span><span>However, Kraugel didn’t give a lengthy explanation. It was just the excuses of a loser.</span></p>
 <p><span>"It was the same when fighting Brother Piaro.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“...You are great.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid started to repair the White Clouds clothing, shoes and gloves.&nbsp;</span><span>As a legendary blacksmith, Grid could produce cloth-type armor with good quality, so repairing them wasn’t difficult.&nbsp;</span><span>Kraugel watched Grid and admired his dexterity, then he handed over White Fang.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Can you repair this as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid repaired the armor and grabbed White Fang. Then he became thrilled.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Truly great.’</span></p>
 <p><span>[+9 White Fang]</span></p>
 <p><span>Rating: Legendary</span></p>
 <p><span>Durability: 170/409 &nbsp;Attack Power: 915+486</span></p>
 <p><span>* Attack speed will increase by 7 + 2%.</span></p>
 <p><span>* Skill damage will increase by 10 + 5%.</span></p>
 <p><span>* Ignores 20 + 10% of the target’s defense.</span></p>
 <p><span>* After succeeding in three combos, further damage will be dealt in the form of cutting damage.</span></p>
 <p><span>The favorite weapon of one of the 33 great demons, Drasion.</span></p>
 <p><span>Weight: 887</span></p>
 <p><span>User Restriction: Level 310 or higher. Advanced Sword Mastery level 5 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘There was a reason to be scared. How did he get this to +9...? He must’ve spent a lot of money.’</span></p>
 <p><span>The probability of enhancing legendary equipment was the worst.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid had a passive skill that increased enhancement rate, but even he had to pour a huge amount of money into enhancing Failure to +9.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was impossible to gauge how much money Kraugel would’ve spent in enhancing White Fang.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Anyway, its performance is great.’</span></p>
 <p><span>White Fang. As a great demon’s weapon, it was a very excellent weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span>The options were somewhat lacking, but that wasn’t a disadvantage. The few options meant that the basic attack power was unique. It was comparable to Failure, despite being a one-handed sword.</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid was admiring it when he felt doubts.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Isn’t this too weak for a weapon used by a great demon? The level limit is too low.’</span></p>
 <p><span>The material was strange. The color was reminiscent of mithril at first glance, but its hardiness was several times better than mithril.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘A metal that even a legendary blacksmith can’t recognize...’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>It was likely to be a mineral that could only be collected from hell, like the blood stones.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘If I know the exact material, my proficiency in the blacksmithing skills will greatly increase...’</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid thought for a moment and opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Maybe. It’s possible that I can draw out the true power of this sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Draw out the true power of the sword?&nbsp;</span><span>Kraugel didn’t know about the Legendary Blacksmith’s Appraisal skill, so he couldn’t understand the concept.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid made a suggestion to the puzzled Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span>"If I was to upgrade the performance of this sword, could you help me with one thing in return?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Games. In particular, items were especially important in MMORPGs.&nbsp;</span><span>It was an unchanging truth that the 1st ranked Kraugel was well aware of. Therefore, he spent a lot of money on enhancing his equipment.</span></p>
 <p><span>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span>The reason that Kraugel didn’t have the full armor set was the limitation of the the white swordsman class.&nbsp;</span><span>In this situation a legendary blacksmith was offering an item upgrade.&nbsp;</span><span>It was an irresistible temptation.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I am willing to accept the deal. However, I will pay the value of the upgrade if you make a ridiculous demand.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid used a skill with a happy face.</span></p>
 <p><span>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Appraisal skill has been used.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The blacksmith who became a legend can appraise items with an excellent discerning eye. If a hidden feature exists in the target item, it will be found.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[You have discovered a hidden feature in White Fang!]</span></p>
