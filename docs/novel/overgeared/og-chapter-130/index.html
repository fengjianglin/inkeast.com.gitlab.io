 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>After knocking down the pope.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid left the Vatican once his quest ended and was prepared for a new adventure.&nbsp;</span><span style>But before that, he needed time to recharge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Logout.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid returned to being Shin Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style>He left the capsule and immediately searched for food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m hungry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He distractedly yanked his boxers up his hips as he opened the refrigerator door. Inside were ham and egg rolls, meat and all types of dishes.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the table was a note from his mother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Son. Don't forget to eat meals regularly! It’s good to make money, but don’t play the game too much and exercise as well. ^^’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>His beloved mother.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past, the debt-ridden Shin Youngwoo was always worried at home. He often had to listen to his parents nagging.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now he was different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Shin Youngwoo succeeded in the game and paid off his debt, as well as his father’s.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now he was promoted to the trustworthy eldest son, not the pathetic son they had to worry about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will work harder.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo didn’t want to worry his parents anymore. He didn’t want to see the two of them depressed again. He wanted them to be as happy as they were now.&nbsp;</span><span style>So he reminded himself.&nbsp;</span><span style>Satisfy wasn’t a simple game, it was his work!&nbsp;</span><span style>He would quickly finish this quest and turn to making items, earning more money and making his family happier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He finished his meal.&nbsp;</span><span style>Shin Youngwoo took a break for a while and watched TV. Then he changed to a Satisfy-related channel and started to doze off.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the news, there were reports that the pope of the Rebecca Church had been killed by an unidentified person.&nbsp;</span><span style>The news enthusiastically analyzed who the person was that killed the pope and who would be elected as the new pope.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Shin Youngwoo didn’t see the news due to falling asleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>30 minutes later.&nbsp;</span><span style>Shin Youngwoo woke up and turned off the TV. He stretched before going back to the capsule to access Satisfy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am in the best condition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had a delicious lunch and plenty of rest.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid walked vigorously towards his destination. Thanks to the clean air, he hummed as he walked through the forest. But he was attacked by someone along the way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first, bears appeared and attacked, then people popped out.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their IDs were Black Teddy and Asuka.&nbsp;</span><span style>The IDs were somewhat familiar, but Grid couldn’t recall who they were.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then a battle started without him knowing why.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwaaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"What are these bears?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The summons followed the summoner’s taste.&nbsp;</span><span style>In general, male summoners preferred pretty women, while female summoners preferred handsome men.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was also a strong tendency to summon monsters that were intimidating to the opponent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But these bears?&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, there were quite a few users who liked animal-shaped pets like Black Teddy. However, it wasn’t to the extent of Black Teddy.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t just one or two bears. Like a bear fanatic, all of his pets were bears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Summon White Bear Warriors!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had already defeated different types of bears.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Black Teddy summoned a white bear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It wore a red cloak with black sunglasses.&nbsp;</span><span style>Somehow, it seemed stupid. The bear who had a serious expression with folded arms seemed quite laughable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Isn’t it kind of cute?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid lost his tension and was caught off guard.&nbsp;</span><span style>The white bear warrior didn’t miss this chance.&nbsp;</span><span style>It jumped through the air at the speed of lightning and dealt an uppercut.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 2,550 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The effect of Doran’s Ring has been activated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[1,275 health has been restored.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fast and strong.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Asuka approached the surprised Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>She wielded the double swords at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Chaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chukak.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 2,900 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Girl...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was quickly wounded. It was difficult to defend against the two swords that attacked different parts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'These two, they are good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had defeated the pope alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>He thought that maybe he was the strongest? That idea was quickly removed as Grid became alert. Then he observed Black Teddy and Asuka. He used his high insight to grasp their combat power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was startled.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asuka had 18,000 combat power while Black Teddy only had 9,000, but that increased to 20,000 with his summons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Their IDs are familiar. Are they top rankers?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid hurriedly opened his inventory. Then he took out the Holy Light set that was so gorgeous it was burdensome to wear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have equipped the Holy Light Battle Gear set.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The additional effects of defense +500 and health +6,000 have been received.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pure white armor with gold thread and the gloves gleamed. In addition, the small silver crown emanated dignity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Now he seems like a high level user. That scruffy appearance was just a gimmick.'&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment that Black Teddy thought so.&nbsp;</span><span style>The person with the ID of Grid put away the dagger and pulled out a giant black greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That sword...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asuka’s eyes widened with surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was the reason she joined the Tzedakah Guild?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because she wanted to know the class of the helmeted person who displayed overwhelming skills at Winston and slaughtered the Giant Guild members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wanted to figure out all of the hidden classes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a second generation heir of a conglomerate, she came in contact with traders every day, and sometimes these traders sold her information about hidden classes. But she couldn’t change into just any hidden class. There were countless types of hidden classes, so she needed a lot of information to make the best choice. She had to meet with as many hidden classes as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the Tzedakah Guild hid the man in the skull helmet and didn’t let her meet him. It was annoying because she couldn’t fulfill her original intention of joining the guild, but now she happen to come across him in an unexpected situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are the Psychopath Butcher right?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Asuka didn’t conceal her friendly tone as she asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wanted to snap at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Frostlight Orc Chief’s Helmet was destroyed by the pope!&nbsp;</span><span style>He appeared like a prince in a manhwa thanks to the silver crown, yet he was still being called psychopath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They know it’s me due to Dainsleif, even if the Frostlight Orc Chief’s Helmet is gone. Rather, shouldn’t she be attracted to my appearance?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Holy Light Battle Gear set had a very beautiful appearance.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was confident that it was cooler than any existing battle gear set.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was expecting girls to think he looked cool when wearing this set.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was mistaken.&nbsp;</span><span style>The completion of fashion relied on the face!&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had a somewhat average appearance so he would only cause resentment when he tried to dress gorgeously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened to the skull helmet? I think I preferred it when you wore the skull helmet.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Asuka talked randomly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Grid’s anger reached its peak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This girl... Not even introducing yourself before attacking someone... No, it’s even a personal attack?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wasn’t the type to become nice to someone because they were a woman.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asuka had a considerable beauty, but it wasn’t enough to weaken Grid’s mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ll be sorry!”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid gritted his teeth and replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he started his sword dance.&nbsp;</span><span style>A sharp killing intent was concentrated on the greatsword and the air around it started to vibrate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A powerful attack flew towards Asuka’s heart.&nbsp;</span><span style>The surprised Black Teddy commanded the white bear warrior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Defend the young lady!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwaaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The white bear warrior was level 280. Among Black Teddy’s pets, it was the one with the strongest combat ability. It was stronger than a ranker.&nbsp;</span><span style>The bear swung and fist and stood up to the greatsword wrapped in darkness.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The two collided.&nbsp;</span><span style>It seemed close at first glance, but that only lasted for a moment. The balance quickly broke as Grid’s Kill tore the mighty flesh of the white bear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the greatsword went through the thick body of the white bear warrior.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Grrr!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The white bear’s health was decreased by 1/3rd with one strike.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asuka would’ve fallen into a critical condition if hit by that.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the biggest advantage of a pet was that it didn’t know pain. The bear didn’t shrink back despite suffering massive damage. Instead, it counterattacked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The head of the white bear warrior hit Grid’s chest.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it didn’t do much damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>Previously, Grid only wore boots and a cloak, so he was low in defense. Now he showed a high defense due to the Holy Light battle gear set. He didn’t feel any pain at all from the headbutt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the option of the Holy Light Gloves activated and ‘Counterattack’ was used, dealing great damage to the white bear warrior.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, Black Teddy had to interfere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Berserk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Summoners had dozens of passive and active skills that enhanced a pet’s abilities.&nbsp;</span><span style>Among them, Berserk was a skill that only second advancement summoners could use.&nbsp;</span><span style>It gave pets a status conditions immune effect and temporarily doubled all of a pet’s stats.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kyaooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The white bear cried out and swung its paws. Grid became on the defensive due to the fast and powerful onslaught. He would be subjected to terrible damage if he allowed the attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'What is this all of a sudden?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was confused for a moment.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had a lot of combat experience so he quickly figured out the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is it a temporary buff? The abilities are raised to this level, so the duration must be short.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid triggered Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Restraint.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the white bear hesitated and retreated from Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Teddy was nervous,&nbsp;</span><span style>'What is this all of a sudden? My commands aren’t going through!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The duration of Berserk was only 10 seconds. Every second spent retreating was valuable for Black Teddy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid triggered Blacksmith's Rage in this gap and rushed towards Asuka.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Asuka crossed her double swords and tried to fight back. But Grid took the lead with his fast pace, forcing her on the defensive without a chance to fight back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Strange.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asuka was filled with doubts after fighting Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The greatsword that Grid was using was over 3m in length and seemed extremely heavy. Then what was this attack speed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Isn’t it normal for the attack speed to be slow?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a stereotype.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Dainsleif was very light, despite being a greatsword.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a sword made by Albatino, who was called the best blacksmith before Pagma, and was made of black iron, which was harder than steel, but twice as light.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dainsleif was a weapon that minimized the disadvantages of a greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At first glance, Asuka seemed to be on the defensive against Grid’s ruthless strikes.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Asuka still had some room.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, this was her forte.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her class was a berserker.&nbsp;</span><span style>She became stronger as the battle continued.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Asuka was able to adapt to Grid’s attack speed and she finally started her counterattack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sword Frenzy!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Flash!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Asuka’s blue eyes turned red the moment she activated a skill&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Asuka’s double swords started to dance in a dazzling manner.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaeeeeeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was the berserker’s representative skill that attacked a target nine times, Sword Frenzy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid succeeded in defending against six strikes, but was unable to prevent the remaining three and was hurt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 1,700 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 1,650 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 1,810 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asuka provoked Grid,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Certainly, your defense has increased since you equipped the armor. But isn’t it just high defense? You can’t catch up with the speed of my double swords and will just be a sandbag.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid scoffed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Link!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Papat!</span></i> <i><span style>Pa pa pa pa!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black energy swords were generated at a tremendous rate and hit Asuka.&nbsp;</span><span style>The confused Asuka once again triggered Sword Frenzy, but it was useless.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sword Frenzy might attack 9 times, but Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Link, attacked a total of 17 times.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sword Frenzy couldn’t completely offset it and Asuka’s body became covered with wounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Grid pointed his sword at Asuka’s neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is your purpose for attacking me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand...</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Magic power has started to manipulate your body. It is hard to reject.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You will become the puppet of ‘Box’ for three seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban couldn’t move his body according to his will.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the 1st ranked paladin with high magic resistance, so how could he be manipulated so easily? Toban thought it was ridiculous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I still have a long way to go.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It hurt his reputation. It was an insult that couldn’t be washed away.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban trembled.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the person who was really shocked was Box, not Toban.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can only control him for three seconds?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Puppet magic was the ultimate magic for a linker.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a powerful magic that sent magic power into the body of the target in order to manipulate it.&nbsp;</span><span style>And Box’s ability to control magic power was by far the best among the linkers.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Box used the puppet spell, he could manipulate a monster for up to 5 minutes and a user for 30 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet Toban was only three seconds?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The higher the level and magic resistance of the target, the lower the manipulation time. But... Isn’t it guaranteed at least 10 seconds, even if the opponent has a higher level than me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban’s magic resistance seemed to be different from all the opponents he met so far.&nbsp;</span><span style>Box admired it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is the dignity of the 1st ranked paladin. The Tzedakah Guild is filled with monsters.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Puppet had a cooldown time of two hours.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a skill that could only be used once every two hours, so it was a waste to control a person for only three seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style>Box sighed and started to control the magic power connected to Toban.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chief, go and help Asuka.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“H-Hey! Stop!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban begged but it was no use. His body suddenly moved into the gap between Grid and Asuka. Then he used a shield to deflect the greatsword pointing at Asuka’s neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Toban?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s eyes widened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban laughed awkwardly,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Ah, hello?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The puppet magic was released.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban could move freely so he tried to explain the matter, but Box interrupted.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I am glad to meet you for the first time, Grid.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid felt instinctive dislike whenever he met a handsome man. So his expression darkened the moment Box appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Box said to him.&nbsp;</span><span style>"The three of us joined the guild a while ago. Right now, we are helping Chief with a quest. The quest requires us to kill you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid doubted his ears and looked at Toban.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The panicked Toban explained the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grid, it is a misunderstanding. I didn’t know that you were the target of the quest. This is...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kyaooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The white bear warrior was released from the influence of Restraint. Then it ran to Grid, who was listening to Toban, and smacked Grid on the head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 3,200 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jeurereuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid spoke softly while bleeding from the head,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Are you talking to keep my attention so that someone else can attack...? Toban, are you really going to be like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a huge misunderstanding.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban panicked.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this rate, Grid might not make an item for him at all. He couldn’t push Grid. Therefore, he had to get rid of this misunderstanding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Black Teddy! What are you doing? Can’t you understand the atmosphere? Grid is a fellow guild member! Stop attacking!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban shouted but Black Teddy just stroked his teddy bear and pretended not to know anything.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, Grid’s anger exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Toban... You must’ve held a tremendous grudge after saying that I would make you item last. Right? So now you want revenge?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban shouted,&nbsp;</span><span style>“That isn’t the case! Right now, I am doing a quest to kill the mysterious person who kill the pope and took the treasures! I didn’t know that the person would be you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Didn’t you attack me after knowing the truth? You know that I am the enigmatic person, so this is a great opportunity to proceed with the quest? Right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No! Listen to my explanation! We don’t have to fight! Sell me the treasures! I just need the treasures!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...You just need the treasures?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid started to understand the situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>A relieved Toban pointed to the items that Grid was wearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Holy Light set. That's what I need.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid frowned,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Are you crazy? I won’t sell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“H-Hey, Grid. I’ll give you a lot of money. Please do this for me just once. Yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban begged. In fact, Grid was inwardly delighted.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was thinking that it wouldn’t be possible to sell these items due to the limited usage conditions.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid started acting as he asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sigh... I will consider agreeing to the favor since we are part of the same guild. How much will you buy it for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"2,000 gold each, for a total of 6,000 gold?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban didn’t know the features of the Holy Light set. He regarded it as simple quest items when he set the price. He was confident that he set a high price, but Grid was annoyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if it had a system of exclusive use, the Holy Light set still had a legendary rating. He thought he would get at least two million gold for each piece. But Toban wanted to buy it for 2,000 gold each? He must be joking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Are you playing with me right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t this reaction strange?&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban changed the value.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then 2,200 gold each...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Get lost."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How much do you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Two million gold each.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was adamant. The Holy Light set was excellent, so it was better to use it himself unless it was sold for two million gold each. He wouldn’t sell it for any less than that.&nbsp;</span><span style>But from Toban’s perspective, the Holy Light set were simple quest items and Grid seemed like a scammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey, this is honestly too much... I received my first SS-grade quest so please help me clear it...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Box whispered to Toban who had a grim expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Chief, we want to fight with Grid to see his strength.</span></i> <i><span style>We will kill him and obtain the items for you.</span></i> <i><span style>Okay?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was the temptation of the devil.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban asked Grid one last time,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Grid, these items... Do you really intend to sell it for two million gold each? It isn’t a joke?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’m being serious. I’m not joking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The negotiations broke down.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban closed his eyes. And he whispered to Box.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Pretend to use magic on me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"...?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Box was puzzled but acted according to Toban’s request. He used a spell to enchant Toban.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Toban suddenly disappeared. He shouted and sat down. Then he started acting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No? What is this? I can’t move one finger freely. This is the ultimate linker magic that controls the target at will. I have been hit by Puppet! Oh my! This is serious! I can no longer stop them from attacking. Grid! It’s dangerous!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
