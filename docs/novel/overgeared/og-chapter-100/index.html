 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Pon immediately bowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grid, you are better than any blacksmith I have ever seen. I’m truly honored to have a great craftsman like you as my colleague.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Up to now, Pon had visited a large number of blacksmiths and commissioned the production of items.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He crossed the Hell Desert to meet the best blacksmith in the east, and experienced the invasion of the fire dragon Trauka to meet a famous dwarf blacksmith. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that he met famous blacksmiths from all over the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, Pon couldn’t get any unique rated production items despite his efforts.&nbsp;</span><span style>No matter how well-known the blacksmith, making a unique item was like picking a star from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then what about Grid?&nbsp;</span><span style>He made three items, and one of them was completed as unique rated.&nbsp;</span><span style>Furthermore, the performance of the Gale Spear produced by Grid was well above that specified in the production method.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There was a suggestion that he could make legendary rated items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid exceeded common sense. The blacksmith they desperately searched for was a hidden treasure. Pon’s respect rose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Amazing. You’re really amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There would come a day when all guild members would be armed with weapons and armor made by Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the Tzedakah Guild would truly soar to the top.&nbsp;</span><span style>The thrilled Pon put away the old spear he had been using for a long time and took out the Gale Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That’s the Gale Spear...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guild members marvelled at the appearance of the Gale Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style>The spear was a magnificent blend of blue and silver. It seemed like a blue dragon descending from a silver galaxy.&nbsp;</span><span style>The appearance was beautiful enough to be comparable to ‘Persona,’ a national treasure of the Saharan Empire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'The performance is great and the appearance is beautiful. Also.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Buuong.</span></i> <i><span style>Buuong.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A dark smile spread across Pon’s face as he looked at the spear and swung it lightly a few times.&nbsp;</span><span style>He tried using hundreds of spears, but the Gale Spear was outstanding. &nbsp;The length and width of the spear was ideal for him. It was like a spear customized just for himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I feel several times stronger.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted to run to the hunting grounds and test the power of the spear right now. The guild members approached him and urged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pon, what is the rating of your spear? It doesn’t look ordinary.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Come on, show us. I’m dizzy from curiosity!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon shared the information of the Gale Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style>The guild members’ mouths dropped open as they confirmed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unique?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A unique rated item was produced?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had a big impact on the guild.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was Pon the only one with the desire to be armed with excellent items? They also met a number of blacksmiths like Pon, and made hundreds of production requests. But they never saw any unique rated production items.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was theoretically possible for a high level blacksmith to produce unique items, but it was more realistic to acquire unique items through raids instead of making them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had signed up to the guild and he made a unique item in just three days.&nbsp;</span><span style>All blacksmiths except for him were insignificant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The atmosphere was rising.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cool...”&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka couldn’t control her joy and embraced Grid. She kissed his cheek and shouted.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Grid, really great! You're the best! Truly a fantastic man!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka’s hug and kiss removed all rational feelings. This was just the greeting of a South American woman expressing pure joy and gratitude.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it was too much stimulus for Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The embrace and kiss from a woman considered one of the sexiest in the world wasn’t something that Grid’s mental state could endure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘H-Her lips are so soft...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>His cheeks seemed to be melting.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Her chest is soft...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t just soft but filled with elasticity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘She smells good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Any expensive fragrance was trivial in front of Jishuka’s body odor.&nbsp;</span><span style>So the conclusion...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is this a dream? Of course it is a dream. Damn! It is okay to dream! I don’t care even if I die.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Grid was struggling, Vantner was frustrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is nonsense... This spear is better than any weapon I’ve ever seen. Even my Genuine Twin Bloody Axes is nothing in front of this spear... Pon is the one who gets such a great weapon? It isn’t possible... Pon will get ahead of me again...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner shook as he muttered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grid, inviting you to the guild is one of the best things I’ve done in my life! I love you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka kept hugging Grid tightly with joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe... Chest... Hihi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s face was buried in Jishuka’s big chest.&nbsp;</span><span style>The status of the three people wasn’t normal. It wasn’t a good sight.&nbsp;</span><span style>But none of the guild members restrained the three of them. Everybody was busy looking at the Gale Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ahhh~ I’m really envious of Pon. I will have no regrets if I get a unique item like Pon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It has a better performance than the unique items that we acquired in raids. How absurd.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who is Grid going to make an item for after Pon? Has it been decided yet? I want a piece of armor...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon left the information about the unique Gale Spear in the guild window. Then he pulled out the two epic rated Gale Spears and spoke to Faker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I want to use this opportunity to learn how to wield two spears.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shadowy figure of Faker nodded.&nbsp;</span><span style>"It is a good idea. It is a difficult skill to acquire, but it is an excellent power if you can use it properly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Will you be my practice partner?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no reason to refuse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faker raised his dagger and appeared behind Pon. Then he aimed his dagger at Pon’s heart.&nbsp;</span><span style>Faker had assassinated numerous talented people, but Pon was a persistent opponent.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Pon rotated the spear in his left hand and used the repulsive force to deflect the dagger, then he swung the spear in his right hand.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Swaeek!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Pon effectively used the elasticity of the Tipan wood. The Gale Spear moved like a living snake and hit Faker’s back.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Loud sounds occurred in the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s right. The Gale Spear blew up the air.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Faker was already somewhere else.&nbsp;</span><span style>Faker appeared in the opposite direction and threw hidden weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You are already familiar with using two spears. Have you been constantly practicing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon placed one of the spears on his shoulder and replied,&nbsp;</span><span style>“I’ve never practiced. But my basic abilities are excellent, so I can adapt to new techniques quickly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjaejaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Jaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Chachachachang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Faker was the number one assassin. His unified ranking might be lower than Pon, but his agility surpassed Pon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So in the beginning, Faker took the lead with his speed. No matter how brilliantly Pon moved his spears, Faker repelled them like a stream of water. Only Pon’s spears were scratched. It was when the power of an assassin specializing in PK was clearly revealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But as time passed, the situation reversed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pon’s attack speed started to exceed Faker’s agility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faker, who rarely allowed any attacks, retreated while scattering blood. Pon chased him, thrusting forward with his spears.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk!</span></i> <i><span style>Peok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Gale Spear was a remarkable weapon. Due to the unique option, its attack speed increased as the battle continued. It was hard to tell the difference in the beginning, but the story changed over time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isn’t this cheating...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faker laughed as he was dominated in speed, despite being more confident in his speed than anyone else. Pon thought about Kraugel as he drank a health potion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Now I might be able to touch his collar.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... Is this a smithy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The visitors to Khan’s smithy were stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the center of the smithy, 10 people were gathered together and talking loudly, while a man and woman were hugging to one side. There was a large middle-aged man squatting in the corner and...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Chaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Two crazy people exchanging blows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was this really a smithy? Even the heart of the market was calm compared to this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Maybe we’re at the wrong place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, customers who came to the smithy to buy items came and went several times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What the hell is going on in this smithy?”&nbsp;</span><span style>The turmoil only subsided when Khan returned to the smithy and yelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Heok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid regained his sense of reason at Khan’s voice. He looked at Jishuka’s fantastic body, which must’ve seduced men around the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'She is truly tricky. She must be trying to avoid paying me for this.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid realized it through his experience with Ahyoung.&nbsp;</span><span style>Women were enemies. He couldn’t be off guard in front of them. He would have a cruel experience if he let them into his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was reminded of his bad memories and turned to stone when looking at Jishuka. Then he called out to Pon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey, don't play around and give me the payment. How much are you going to buy it for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How much?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Pon approached Grid and said cautiously.&nbsp;</span><span style>"To be honest, it is difficult for me to accurately assess the value of the Gale Spear. But considering other items, I think I should pay at least 800,000.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“800,000?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid doubted his ears.&nbsp;</span><span style>“800,000 gold?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course he was surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had sold the legendary rated Sword of Self-transcendence for 220,000 gold.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the unique rated Gale Spear was purchased for four times the price?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid couldn’t believe it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘800,000 gold in cash...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>100 gold was worth 120,000 won cash.&nbsp;</span><span style>If 100,000 gold is 120 million... 800,000 gold is... Um. Eh? Heok! 960,000,000?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a large amount that could pay off all his father’s debt and still have 300,000,000 remaining.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid shut down for a while. But he recovered within a short amount of time and sent a pitying glance towards Pon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Stupid fool... A legendary item was trade for 220,000 gold, yet you are buying a unique item for 800,000? You are suffering from your ignorance.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was mistaken. Grid was the ignorant one, not Pon.&nbsp;</span><span style>In fact, Grid could’ve made millions of gold if he registered the Sword of Self-transcendence at auction. He would’ve obtained billions of won in cash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Grid didn’t know this and only sold it to a NPC for 220,000 gold.&nbsp;</span><span style>The 800,000 gold that Pon offered now was reasonable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Regas is the number one pushover. Starting from today, Pon is number two.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sometimes it was better not to know the truth...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid nodded at Pon happily without knowing the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay! I’m in a good mood! The two epic spears will be given as a service! 800,000 gold is okay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon had been planning to buy the two epic Gale Spears separately for 150,000 gold, but it was being given to him as a service?&nbsp;</span><span style>Pon was amazed by Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘His usual behaviour seems ugly, but he is actually a manly man. Is he merely acting like that to conceal his true self?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon and the Tzedakah Guild became increasingly favorable towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>One group was spying on Khan’s smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t know that the Tzedakah Guild would use this smithy as their stomping ground... Maybe that person is the unknown craftsman? Pass this onto Chris and ask him to send the rankers!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was the strongest guild in Satisfy?&nbsp;</span><span style>If this question was asked to 10 people who were passing by right now, 9 out of 10 would mention the Giant Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Giant Guild was the largest in scale!&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to invite the unknown craftsman, they came to Winston, only to discover Grid with the Tzedakah Guild.</span></p>
