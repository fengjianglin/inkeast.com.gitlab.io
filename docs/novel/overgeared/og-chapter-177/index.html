 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurent? If he participates in PvP, I will log him out in 30 seconds.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a shocking declaration.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was only the sound of breathing everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Are you making fun of the United States?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The United States’ power was superior to all the countries that competed in the National Competition. It wasn’t uncommon for people to think that the United States would win the overall competition.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent was the number two user in the US team. Yet&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent was going to be logged out in only 30 seconds?&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo’s remark was dangerous enough to stimulate the entire American population.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'This will unconditionally be a front page headline!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amazing.&nbsp;</span><span style>A scoop above all other scoops.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reporters’ eyes shone.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, the Korean reporters were thrilled. How excited would Koreans become when they heard Youngwoo’s remark? They couldn’t even fathom it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the American reporters were uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The experts have analyzed that Hurent is better than you. Don’t you think you are acting too proudly? It seems to be an exaggeration.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You declared it publicly, but what if you can’t log out Hurent in 30 seconds? Then you will be be disgraced globally. Can you afford the mockery and criticism from the public?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The world will become disappointed that the first legendary class is a simple braggart. Do you have any intention of withdrawing your remark?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no question if this was a question or a threat.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo drove home his point to the American reporters who were subtly threatening him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I am better than you think.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, Youngwoo was a below average player. He took a leave of absence from school and played Satisfy as soon as it was released, but he fell behind others instead of getting ahead.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he fell to hell when he performed Earl Ashur’s quest to find Pagma’s Rare Book. He wasted several months on the quest, and kept dying and losing his possessions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to his unyielding spirit, he barely managed to become Pagma’s Descendant, but his personality and lack of talent were problems. He was unable to properly handle the fraudulent class and wasted several months.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it changed after the Malacus raid.&nbsp;</span><span style>After building a relationship with the Tzedakah Guild and going through all types of incidents, Youngwoo gradually changed. He surely grew.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now at this moment.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo was confident that he was the best player.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please don’t overlook the fact that I am a legend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was proud about overcoming the trials that accompanied his pathetic nature and lacking talent.&nbsp;</span><span style>He expressed this pride without any shame.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am the best. Control? You shouldn’t judge and ignore people because of that.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gulp.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The reporters swallowed their dry saliva.&nbsp;</span><span style>The hundreds of reporters were convinced at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He’s a star.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not all of Satisfy’s talents were stars.&nbsp;</span><span style>Only a handful of people who had something special that would stimulate and make the public enthusiastic could become a star.&nbsp;</span><span style>From that perspective, Youngwoo was a true star.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was the first legendary class and had a pride that matched it. The uncompromising words might make someone feel uncomfortable, but it would give others excitement.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would be a hot topic whenever he opened his mouth, regardless of whether it was positive or negative.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The excited reporters continued to question him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“’A successor to Pagma’s techniques and will has emerged. He’s the only one in the world that can create legendary items.’ That phrase appeared in Satisfy. As the phrase suggests, can you create legendary items?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Truly a legendary blacksmith!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How likely is it that a legendary item would be produced?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It isn’t high right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is the difference between your legendary items and the legendary items that can be acquired from raids?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do all your equipped items have a legendary rating?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s predicted that many top guilds will invite you. Have you ever thought about leaving the Tzedakah Guild?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is your stealth? Or did you create an invisibility cloak like many experts speculated?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The interview lasted more than 30 minutes. But the reporters’ questions never seemed to end. On the other hand, Youngwoo was a beginner at interviews and reached the limit of his concentration.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is crazy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the first place, Youngwoo wasn’t a clever person. Until now, he had been able to lead the interview with full confidence, but he couldn’t grasp the point of the current questions.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura noticed his difficulty and restrained the reporters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The interview ends here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isn’t there time to spare until the next event? Can’t you cooperate a bit more?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. It will end here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura had a definite personality. Her decision was final.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reporters were well aware of her nature and retreated. They were already satisfied with the scoops that they got.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sigh... That wasn’t an easy task.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the reporters left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo finally let out a deep breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura encouraged him,&nbsp;</span><span style>"You did well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her ebony hair flicked back as she smiled beautifully, making her seem like a refreshing tonic.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo felt like all his fatigue was released just looking at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you. I was able to do well thanks to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Rather, I should be the one thanking you. Thanks to you coming today, I was able to win a gold medal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo had clearly stated his intention to not participate in the National Competition. Nevertheless, the Korean government and Yura arbitrarily put him on the list.&nbsp;</span><span style>It would’ve been very unpleasant for Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, Yura knew that Youngwoo wouldn’t participate in the competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was grateful that he appeared at an unexpected moment and got good results. On the other hand, she was sorry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Aren’t you angry at me?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura carefully asked Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I was mad that you got me involved as you pleased.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura bowed her head.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Youngwoo spoke to her with a soft expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But in the end, it was me who decided to participate in the National Competition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>He made the decision himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don’t blame you. And I unexpectedly like this stage. I really like the situation right now. Ah~ it’s enjoyable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m glad.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked at Youngwoo with clear affection. Unfortunately, Youngwoo failed to notice this fact.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, articles about Youngwoo were being spread all over the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Shocking news! Pagma's Descendant isn’t complete yet!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The golden discs and blades are Pagma's Descendant’s exclusive items! Will future legendary classes also have exclusive items?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The owner of the first legendary class, Shin Youngwoo. In reality, he’s just an ordinary youth.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Yura and Jishuka? It’s a simple friendship.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Pagma's Descendant can make legendary rated items.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[(Column) The economic influence that Pagma's Descendant can exercise is astronomical. Grid will become the richest.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Grid has no intention of leaving the Tzedakah Guild.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Can Grid really produce an invisibility cloak?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Grid, ‘Hurent? I’m not complete yet, but I can logout the 8th place person on the unified rankings in 30 seconds.']</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Americans are angry at Grid’s arrogant remark!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[There is a festive atmosphere in Korea.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Korean team’s waiting room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha! Grid is doing well in interviews!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Korean players treated Youngwoo like a hero.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I felt relieved after seeing all the American reporters close their mouths!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’m looking at the reactions from overseas sites right now, and it isn’t a joke! There is an uproar and foreigners are envious of South Korea.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I never imagined that the first legendary class would be a Korean! My heart beat wildly the moment you came!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid is the light of hope for South Korea! I’m proud!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huhuhut...! Korea’s light of hope... It’s a good saying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the midst of the excited players, Youngwoo’s nose rose into the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, the real time search terms of the Internal portal sites included ‘Grid,’ ‘Grid’s interview,’ Grid’s class quest,’ ‘Shin Youngwoo,’ ‘Pagma’s Descendant,’ ‘legendary items,’ ‘30 second logout,’ ‘invisibility cloak,’ golden blades’ and so on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the same for TV.&nbsp;</span><span style>Most of the broadcasting stations around the world repeatedly showed how Youngwoo actively destroyed the targets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Shin’s vegetable store.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo’s parents were stunned when they turned on the TV for the first time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why was their son on TV?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...What’s this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo’s parents thought it was a dream.&nbsp;</span><span style>The news anchors and experts were praising their son as one of Korea’s heroes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>News!</span></i> <i><span style>Did you see the news?</span></i> <i><span style>Aren’t you really proud of your son?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Youngwoo’s mother always boasted about her son, but isn’t her son a really good person?</span></i> <i><span style>I’m so envious~ so happy~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Their phones rang endlessly. Alumni who they hadn’t talked to in more than 10 years called.&nbsp;</span><span style>They all spoke about how Youngwoo was a treasure of Korea.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo’s parents’ hearts filled up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, there were people who visited Youngwoo in the Korean team’s waiting room and produced a friendly atmosphere.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were Jishuka, Regas and Pon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo lost his soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is that a person?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka’s body ratio in real life was too unrealistic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t wear heels, but she looked larger than life. In particular, her legs were very long. Youngwoo was approximately 10cm taller than her, but the length of her legs seemed longer. Her face was also very small.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her body ratio was like the model of the famous artwork X, which had been lauded as a ‘work of art from God.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Pretty.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her eyes and lustrous red lips stimulated male instincts.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her bright coppery skin and voluptuous body proved why she was regarded as one of the sexiest beauties in the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka ran to him, who was standing at a loss for words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I wanted to see you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the moment when a South American woman’s aggressiveness was revealed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-Wait...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo had already experienced being hugged by Jishuka several times. He was even a married man.&nbsp;</span><span style>But that was in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>In reality, he was a virgin who never once dated anyone.&nbsp;</span><span style>The world’s sexiest woman was hugging him, so he couldn’t cope with the stimulation and got a nosebleed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, Grid looks the same in reality and in Satisfy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. It’s different from a certain person."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas and Pon smiled. On the other hand, the Korean players were blinded with jealousy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yura acted like his manager during the interview and now Jishuka...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He said there was no relationship between them in the interview... No matter how I look at it, isn’t this special?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Monopolizing two goddesses...! Even if he’s Grid, it’s hard to forgive...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Yura’s gaze was cold as she looked at Jishuka hugging Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka met her eyes and stuck her tongue out.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura's thin eyebrows narrowed together.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pachichik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Sparks flew as the two women’s gazes crossed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The waiting room of the United States team.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahahahat! Hurent is going to be logged out in only 30 seconds?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 2nd ranked Zibal laughed pleasantly.&nbsp;</span><span style>He scoffed at Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>“He still doesn’t understand, despite his weakness being revealed in the target processing event. That dumb guy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t just incompetent, but stupid as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Indeed, he was so stupid that the highly acclaimed legendary class was dimmed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurent, thoroughly smash him in PvP. Embarrass him publicly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel frowned at Zibal.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Honestly, is he a person to poke fun at? In the target processing event, he didn’t use the golden blades as weapons. If he does, the likelihood of Hurent winning in a one-on-one match will decrease.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Our rookie is saying so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zibal smiled like he was cute and shifted his gaze to Hurent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Hurent giggled while reading an adult magazine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry ~ Lauel. I also have power that I haven’t shown.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His battle method that utilized the use of aura was extraordinary.&nbsp;</span><span style>Given Grid’s sense of control that he displayed in the target processing, it was hard for Hurent to imagine that he would be defeated, even considering the added bonus of the golden blades.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma's Descendant is clearly a superior class. But Grid is incompetent. He won’t be able to beat me. This is fa~te.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid might’ve succeeded in raids due to the performance of his items, but a match against a human was different. Control was the most important part.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent really recognized that Grid was inferior to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a few moments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent held a press conference because of the media’s enthusiastic request for him to respond to the ‘30 seconds logout’ statement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes~ I am too mature to respond to my opponent’s statement about logging me out in 30 seconds... I won’t say anything. But let’s make this as clear as possible ~ that newbie will fall to his knees in front of me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a clapping sound.&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to Hurent’s press conference and Grid’s interview, the atmosphere of the National Competition became heated up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three days later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The world’s attention was focused on the PvP event that would be held on the last day of the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid and Hurent, who would be the one who got the stigma of being a braggart?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The various illegal gambling facilities and sites hurriedly started the betting.&nbsp;</span><span style>And the Tzedakah Guild didn’t miss this opportunity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will bet everything on Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the target processing, Hurent had escaped from Grid. Due to that, people analyzed that Hurent was better than Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Therefore, the betting odds of Grid winning was raised to 3.2 times.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Tzedakah Guild knew Grid’s real power, so this was a golden opportunity for them.</span></p>
