 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>『 There are many users who are exploring the path to hell in order to obtain a memphis, commonly referred to as ‘Noe.’ There was a theory that the entrance to hell is somewhere in the Astra Mountains, but that turned out to be false. ‘User robbers’ in the Astra Mountains are believed to have spread the information in order to attract people, so please be careful. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 I’ve just received breaking news. It’s said that a map of the legendary ‘Siren Kingdom’ is being circulated. Countless users are now heading to the Siren Kingdom. Who was the first person to find the Siren Kingdom? There are all types of speculation among the experts... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo listened to Satisfy related news while driving.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t out of interest, but obligation.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was now well aware that information was power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The first discoverer of the Siren Kingdom... They would get titles, money and reputation. It’s huge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t know who it was, but he was envious.&nbsp;</span><span style>His stomach started hurting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘...Mind control. Mind control.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo was worried that his hair loss would start again, so he tried to stay calm until he arrived at his destination.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Creak.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo parked 23 and got down.&nbsp;</span><span style>Just two weeks ago, the front of Youngwoo’s house was crowded with people, but not anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style>The people of the neighborhood strictly controlled the access of outsiders, so Youngwoo’s family was able to regain their normal lives.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Welcome.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo’s mother looked 10 years younger.&nbsp;</span><span style>She had been suffering because of her son over the past few years, but now she was always happy because her son was the hero of South Korea.&nbsp;</span><span style>She could see the greatness of her son. She was welcomed everywhere she went, just because she was Youngwoo’s mother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Was the filming completed well? Wash your hands first. Then come eat. I roasted some croaker."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, Youngwoo hadn’t been motivated by anything. Even eating or washing up was troublesome. But now he was completely different. His motivation was revived. He even jogged in the morning with Sehee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oppa, did you only sleep four hours yesterday?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee came out from where she was studying in her room and asked.&nbsp;</span><span style>She didn’t show it, but recently she was very worried about her brother. She was afraid he might collapse from overwork. There was also the tax bombs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo replied while eating rice.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I will be able to sleep more from today onwards. For the time being, I will refrain from broadcasting activities. So let’s jog every morning, starting from tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought that you didn’t want to exercise?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have to do it. I need to take care of my health.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s the right idea. Health is more important than money.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Those were his father’s words.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was always strict because he wanted his son to grow up as quickly as possible, and now he treated his son with sincerity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Youngwoo, you have already succeeded. You have acquired tremendous wealth and honor at a young age. You’ve also paid off my debt. That alone is enough. Don’t ruin your health by being too greedy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right. It was enough.&nbsp;</span><span style>How many people built up 10 billion won assets at the age of 28, as well as acquired a worldwide reputation?&nbsp;</span><span style>The best athletes had hundreds of millions in their bank accounts in their 20’s, but Youngwoo’s father thought that wasn’t necessary.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought that Youngwoo had the same thought.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Youngwoo was still lacking.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo was much greedier than his father thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s better to have more money, Father. Now we are eating yellow corvina as a side dish, but what about in the past?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Up to last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo never saw any beef in his house.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a lot of radish soups and the meat was always pork.&nbsp;</span><span style>The taste wasn’t that good.&nbsp;</span><span style>The radish soup was too light, and the pork was too dry.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo misunderstood while eating the radish soup and pork.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The beef won’t taste that good in soup... Is there a rule that we shouldn’t have beef in our house?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But what was the truth?</span></p>
 <p><span style>This year, he ate a lot of beef.&nbsp;</span><span style>The soup broth boiled with brisket was much sweeter and tastier, while the pork skewers made with good pork were soft and easy to chew. It went without saying that the beef short ribs melted in his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>There wasn’t a rule against beef.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was just that his family didn’t have money for beef. The difference between having money and no money was revealed from such a small thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m going to make more money, Father.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo’s father was a person who lived thinking that he should save, rather than earn a lot.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo didn’t say it aloud, but he was much greedier than his father.&nbsp;</span><span style>He already had a taste of money, so he didn’t want to lose it.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t want to go back to the life where he didn’t have any money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yes... I will accept Huroi and Lauel’s opinions.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo felt aware of it after his father.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was looking at a higher place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Become a lord.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bairan Village, ruled by the Tzedakah Guild, was elevated to a city 10 days ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>People were attracted to Grid, Jishuka, Pon and Regas’ actions in the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>And Bairan’s monthly taxes collected was a huge 500,000 gold. It was valued at approximately 600 million won.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It meant that developing one territory would earn him a huge amount of money every month. He couldn’t not feel greedy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will have an estate.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Satisfy, Youngwoo was the husband of a territory owner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But being the husband and being the lord were distinctly different. As Irene’s husband, he might have some influence on the policies, but he wasn’t authorized to directly manage the taxes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo wanted to own a territory himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the meal ended.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oppa.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Good night.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee wanted to say something, but in the end, she just went back to her room.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was acting strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good night~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo was so deep in thought that he couldn’t notice his sister’s strange behavior. He immediately entered the capsule.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I will begin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The time finally came to log into Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>But before that, there was something he had to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"First of all."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttalkak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo accessed the Internet and entered ‘Grid’s Fan Cafe.’ Then as one of the 1.36 million members, he started writing praise about Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He did this on a daily basis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Grid-nim looks so cool!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more I look, the more handsome he is. ^^ ~ There was a rumor that he was bald, but that is clearly groundless ^^ㅎㅎ</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Good."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wore a partial wig for a while before of his hair loss. There was some rumors saying that he looked strange on air or that he was bald.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo was satisfied with the post he wrote about himself and succeeded in joining Noe’s fan club.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe’s fan club had 500,000 more members than his.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Dammit...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A cat was more popular than him?&nbsp;</span><span style>His pride hurt every time he saw it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo started writing slanderous words about Noe as usual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Noe is plain-looking ㅋ&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe will ruin Grid’s beauty when placed side-by-side. The cat is arrogant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now I have released some of my frustration. Huhuhut...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo was satisfied when looking at his malicious post.&nbsp;</span><span style>He finally logged into Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Dear husband~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Winston Castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A woman with a small figure entered Grid’s arms as soon as he opened his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid smiled at the familiar sight as soon as he logged in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you been waiting? Irene.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s facial expression and tone differed depending on who the opponent was.&nbsp;</span><span style>Shin Youngwoo or Grid. He was a blacksmith or a swordsman.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had been living this four-fold life for a long time, so his acting ability naturally increased. No, maybe he had several personalities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Am I that good?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid asked Irene with gentle eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There is no one better than you in this world.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Irene...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Dear husband...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them slept together just yesterday.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was already the 8th time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was a ‘god’ in bed thanks to his high stamina and dexterity stat, so it was natural to be loved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Every day, I want every day to be like yesterday.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha...”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid laughed awkwardly as Irene honestly expressed her desire.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he asked,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Where are my knights?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not sure. Everyone is busy today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had a total of three knights.&nbsp;</span><span style>One was the NPC Jude, while the other two were Huroi and Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style>The first dual class and the strongest of the Ten Rookies had pledged their loyalty to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to the game system, he had to pay at least 500 gold monthly to each knight, but it was worth it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The master/slave relationship was useful in many ways.&nbsp;</span><span style>For example.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Summon Knights.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Which knight would you like to summon?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huroi and Lauel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The summoning command has been sent. The response is pending.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The targets have accepted the summons.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The knights Huroi and Lauel have been summoned.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the knights answered their master’s call, they would be summoned to his side, no matter how far away the two of them were.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a skill so it couldn’t be used in some areas or when he had the silence debuff on him, but Grid was resistant to the silence debuff.&nbsp;</span><span style>It meant Grid could summon the knights at any time, so this system was very good to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You came, Lord.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi was loyal to Grid and now he was completely immersed in genuinely serving Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was like a character from a historical drama.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You connected to the game late today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was no different from Huroi.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was faithful to his role.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t use the exaggerated title of Lord, but he bowed after being summoned.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid looked at his two subordinates for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Come, get up. Huhuhut... I am very glad to see your dependable appearances.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene was embarrassed for some reason. She used the excuse that she was busy and left this place.&nbsp;</span><span style>This meant only three people remained in Grid’s office.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel asked as soon as Irene left.&nbsp;</span><span style>"You could just whisper to us. Why did you use the summoning? Don’t you know that the skill has a cooldown time of 36 hours? What will happen if you can’t use it during a crucial moment?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was unique to Lauel, because he was the only one who could produce the items Lauel wanted.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid spoke like it wasn’t a big deal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Well, what is the big deal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was complete carelessness.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was hard to make Grid act carefully after he defeated big names in the National Competition. Sooner or later, his nose would be hurt by it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘That big nose, I will protect it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Lauel was thinking about the weapon Grid would produce for him, Huroi asked Grid a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then you summoned us because...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi had been in the process of completing a monster hunting sub-quest that took him three hours by drake to get there.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to believe that Grid summoned him because it was urgent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Grid opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to become a lord.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Finally...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was after the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>One month passed in reality, while it was three months in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>During that time, Grid had created items for the Tzedakah and accumulated wealth and skill levels.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid acted faithfully as the guild’s blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was satisfied with this. He was overjoyed every time he got a new production method.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Huroi and Lauel thought this was a waste of Grid’s power.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was unfortunate to see such a unique existence be satisfied with being the blacksmith of a small guild, without any larger goals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them tried to persuade Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Escape from the small cage called the Tzedakah Guild and expand into the wider world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid worried over his decision for a few days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will withdraw from the Tzedakah Guild. I will create my own unique force, based on your opinions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, he decided.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to this, Huroi and Lauel were ecstatic.&nbsp;</span><span style>They thought that the moment to show off their talents had arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Lord will be the first user...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>'To become a king.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two men were thinking about the Snake Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>With Grid’s power, couldn’t they dream about conquering the continent?&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t Zibal, but Grid’s fate to become the first emperor.&nbsp;</span><span style>The two people didn’t doubt it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid currently only had the simple goal of ‘becoming a lord,’ but Huroi and Lauel were dreaming of placing Grid on a higher mountain.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to do that...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"After establishing your new guild, invite the Tzedakah Guild.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inevitably, a lot of talent was required.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Tzedakah Guild had the strongest rankers and were a force that must be absorbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel explained,&nbsp;</span><span style>"The Tzedakah Guild is already addicted to the items you produce and won’t want to lose this. Some of them, including Jishuka, have a vested interest in you. They will surely join you. If you want, they will surely become your subordinates.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was certain of it.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had only followed Grid for a month and within that month, he became someone that couldn’t live without Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was a slave to items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It has been a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A blonde female was attracting attention as she entered Winston.&nbsp;</span><span style>The girl’s ID was Euphemina.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was the first epic class and the first discoverer of the Siren Kingdom.</span></p>
