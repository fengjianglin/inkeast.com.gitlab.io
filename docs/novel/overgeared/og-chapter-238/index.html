 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Most clones were illusions. They were merely a gimmick that couldn’t exert substantial force.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the unidentified man’s clone dealt a real blow. The guild member Elvo screamed as he was hit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The White Wolf guild members became frightened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I heard that a third advancement assassin can have a perfect clone.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What? Then this man is an assassin over level 300?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is that Faker...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faker was the number one assassin and 14th ranked monster on the unified rankings. It was rare for him to reveal himself in public, but there were many rumors. It was said that the number of users assassinated was over 10,000, and rankers were always attacked by him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a rumor that even the first ranked Kraugel suffered a level decrease after being assassinated by Faker.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, they were lies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Faker wasn’t a player killer. He was like Regas and liked personal training.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But rumors were always distorted and exaggerated. The White Wolf Guild misunderstood Faker as a murderer.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was the man in front of them really Faker?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘We are inferior.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Today is my day to die!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The White Wolf members started to shake. They gulped and shivered.&nbsp;</span><span style>Veradin spoke a few words to calm them down.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Assassins don’t use a greatsword. In addition, they are covert. If he was Faker, we would already be dead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were confused and overlooked the obvious facts.&nbsp;</span><span style>The guild members regained their calm as Veradin explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That person is likely to have a hidden class.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a reasonable guess.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hidden classes existed in Satisfy. It wasn’t strange if there was a hidden class specialized in clones.&nbsp;</span><span style>The guild members were relieved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Phew... I'm glad. I don’t want to go against Faker.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dealing with a hidden class is easier than dealing with a third advancement ranker.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Those people are too scary.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It showed how much the dignity of hidden classes had been lost since the third advancement classes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Veradin was alarmed at the guild members’ relaxation and warned them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s still difficult to gauge the opponent’s ability. Don’t act hastily and step back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Th White Wolf members had strong loyalty.&nbsp;</span><span style>They stepped back without a fuss as soon as Veradin commanded them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Step step.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The unidentified man walked through the streets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You aren’t fighting back? Are you scared?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a guild master, Veradin was always cautious. He didn’t fall for the taunts.&nbsp;</span><span style>He closely watched the man and the clone as he asked.&nbsp;</span><span style>"What is your relationship with the Ul Clan? Why are you helping them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The answer was concise.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I got a quest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That person was Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>During his journey, he accidentally visited the Ul Clan’s village and got a quest when the village was attacked by the enemy.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t help wondering if he was cursed to get involved in incidents wherever he went.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Ul Clan’s Rescue]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Difficulty: A</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ul Clan have been deprived of their kingdom by the Saharan Empire, and the survivors are hiding in remote areas. However, they couldn’t escape from the empire’s surveillance and an invasion is once again occurring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Free them from the clutches of the empire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then you will be their sun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Conditions: Repel the invaders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Reward: Your affinity with the Ul Clan will reach the maximum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Failure: The Ul Clan will perish.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Four days ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prior to leaving Reidan, Grid had studied the empire and found that it carried out a policy of genocide.&nbsp;</span><span style>Minorities who didn’t serve the emperor were slaughtered in various parts of the empire. Indeed, it was a brutal oppression.&nbsp;</span><span style>If they wanted to try and oppose it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was futile.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid hadn’t accepted the Ul Clan’s quest for a noble reason. He just coveted the reward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If they don’t have a place to go to and their affinity is at the maximum...'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Couldn’t he accept them as his people?&nbsp;</span><span style>The Ul Clan’s quest was a chance to increase the population of Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>It would be ideal if he could bring all the persecuted minorities in the empire to Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was starting to think and act in the manner of a lord. Lauel would be impressed if he knew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You have two choices."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s eyes shone with killing intent.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was inwardly furious after witnessing the brutality of the White Wolf Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had high respect for NPCs due to the influence of Khan and Irene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can die easily, or you can get beaten up first before you die. Choose.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Crazy bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The White Wolf members were furious.&nbsp;</span><span style>What was this damn arrogant guy saying?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Veradin! How long are you going to let that brat’s mouth run wild? We should attack him right now! Anyway, he’s alone!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elvo was particularly furious.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was surprise attacked by the clone and suffered damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>Veradin checked Elvo’s health gauge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Well, it isn’t bad.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elvo was a berserker, so his defense was very low. However, he only lost one-fifth of his health after the surprise attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The clone isn’t very strong.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The unknown man’s clone was much weaker than he was.&nbsp;</span><span style>This evidence clearly showed that it wasn’t very strong.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘Maybe he can produce a lot of clones. But it’s easy to deal with clones at this level.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Veradin made a judgment call and ordered the guild members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We won’t be able to avoid this fight. Do it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elvo was in the lead. At level 179, he was the lowest among the White Wolf members, but he liked being in the vanguard.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was very courageous and not afraid of others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elvo was full of killing intent.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to deal a nasty blow to the clone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Dash!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A distance of 3m was narrowed in an instant.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elvo smiled with satisfaction at his own dashing ability. Then he used the ‘Madness Vortex’ skill. This was the manifestation of five powerful blows that could even cause great damage to an ogre.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it met the wrong opponent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The target has resisted the damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t defense but resistance. The skill apparently hit. Then what the hell was the resistance to damage?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid stared at the stunned Elvo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You want me to die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The prideful Elvo was now like a terrified rodent.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because of the dignity stat, which had a low chance of making the enemy yield.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had over 1,500 dignity, so it was hard for low or medium ranked users to endure his greatness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have become lost in front of an immeasurable existence. Your head involuntarily bows. Your body is shaky and head begins to move.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘W-What...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was stunned just because he met the person’s gaze? Was this guy a medusa boss?&nbsp;</span><span style>Elvo couldn’t believe the situation right now. It was a dream.&nbsp;</span><span style>The other guild members didn't know the situation and were rushing around, like moths to a flame.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Magic Transmission!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Atra’s Poison!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fire Spear!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lower Cut!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is a kick! Abyooo~!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All types of CC, physical attacks and magic attacks were used.&nbsp;</span><span style>20 enemies used skills at the same time, so Grid seemed to be in danger.&nbsp;</span><span style>The silent clone came out. It was the doppelganger Randy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Revolve.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The counterattack skill was activated at the perfect timing.&nbsp;</span><span style>The White Wolf members were attacked by their own skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this absurd thing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The White Wolf Guild members were agitated.&nbsp;</span><span style>What was with this clone’s skill? Furthermore, it was a counterattack skill that even a person found difficult to use?&nbsp;</span><span style>The one who was most surprised was Veradin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He didn’t show his skills in the first surprise attack!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He realized it right away.&nbsp;</span><span style>Randy had 30% of Grid’s current combat power. To be honest, he was equivalent to level 200. If he wanted, he couldn’t cut the guild member in half with the first attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Randy refrained.&nbsp;</span><span style>He deliberately pretended to be weak to make the enemies less vigilant.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was Randy’s instinctive judgment, not Grid’s orders.&nbsp;</span><span style>He lost his memories of the past, but the battle experience accumulated for more than 100 years was firmly engraved in him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid admired Randy’s strategy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at those facial expressions. I was surprised as well. Isn’t my friend really great?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Friend?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t it a clone?&nbsp;</span><span style>Then what was it?&nbsp;</span><span style>The White Wolf members fell into the black hole of confusion.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Then the jade greatsword penetrated Elvo’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have been hit by a lethal blow!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The enemy has attacked five times using an unknown ability.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 103,900 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Over 100,000? Not 10,000, but 100,000? I don’t even have 20,000 health!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elvo’s vision turned grey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is this a dream?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your party member Elvo has died.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silence filled the area.&nbsp;</span><span style>A monster beyond imagination had appeared in front of the White Wolf members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Veradin kept calm.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was part of the 10 Rookies along with Lauel and Ibellin, and he was now level 281.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t feel frustrated when meeting a strong opponent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Moreover, he had a hidden card.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a sniper who remained in the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Now.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Veradin whispered and gave the signal.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a small flash from the low mountain 300m in the rear, then an arrow came flying.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kiki was also part of the 10 Rookies. The White Wolf Guild’s number two person. Her sniper skill was comparable to Jishuka, the expert archer.&nbsp;</span><span style>She precisely fired an arrow at Grid’s head.&nbsp;</span><span style>Veradin had no doubt that the person would experience great damage or confusion, and took out his staff. He was trying to raise the corpses of the Ul and Elvo with magic when he suddenly froze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T-This...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cries of shock burst out everywhere.&nbsp;</span><span style>They saw it.&nbsp;</span><span style>The famous golden blades.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am surprised.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man’s voice was heard from behind the golden blades that protected their master from the arrow. The voice was filled with a powerful anger that could stop the heart of the person who heard it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sururuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Was it due to the shock wave caused by the arrow and blades colliding?&nbsp;</span><span style>The hat the man was wearing fell off.&nbsp;</span><span style>The ID that most people in the world knew was exposed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first legendary class, three gold medal holder in the National Competition, the hero of the golem invasion, the first user to become a duke, GOD, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He had countless nicknames attached to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he pulled out the blue greatsword that he used to defeat Hurent in five seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style>The people present felt frightened at Grid holding two huge swords in each of his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don’t use surprise attacks!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You did it first!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The White Wolf members wanted to cry out. But they couldn’t grumble.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s eyes fixed to the top of the mountain 300m away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You first of all. Transcended Link.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Blue-white and jade energy blades emerged at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the moment when one small mountain permanently vanished from the map of the Saharan Empire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your party member Kiki has died.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...I would’ve rather met Faker.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The White Wolf members complained. Veradin couldn’t keep his composure anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the worst catastrophe since the guild’s launch.&nbsp;</span><span style>The result was a complete annihilation.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? The size of the desert is less than it was a year ago?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>A black-haired man dressed in white stepped foot in the western part of the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
