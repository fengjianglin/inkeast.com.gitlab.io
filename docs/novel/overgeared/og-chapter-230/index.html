 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style> “My Lord! There are 15 cacti in a cluster 400m ahead! It is presumed to be mine cacti in disguise, so pay special attention..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Advance and destroy them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My Lord! Two golden toads in the oasis are mating! It is wiser to bypass them...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Two field bosses appeared at the same time? This is a jackpot! Charge!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"My Lord! Dozens of desert toads are chasing us 800m in the rear! We have to speed up or they will catch us...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do they want revenge for the golden toads? Okay! Stop! We will meet the prey who are willingly coming to us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My Lord... There is a small nest of giant worms below the mountain...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Go in and sweep them up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the sky, Huroi was able to grasp the terrain in advance and discover the enemies.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he depended on his scouting ability as master of a drake, he would be able to minimize their clashes with monsters until they reached their destination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But who was Grid?&nbsp;</span><span style>He was enthusiastic after not hunting for a long time, so the monsters of the west were destined to be destroyed.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Huroi discovered an enemy, Grid rushed in, rather than avoiding it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to that, the Overgeared members became tired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pant pant! Damn, doesn’t Grid get tired?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel it every time, but Grid’s stamina is much higher than we think.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhh... It’s unbearably hot."</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very hard to march through the desert.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members were top rankers, but they were also users. Due to the repeated battles and heat, their stamina was quickly depleted.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Grid was fine.&nbsp;</span><span style>His stamina was twice as high as the Overgeared members thanks to his persistence stat, which he raised through labor and blacksmith work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No matter how strong the monsters in the west are, fields bosses have obvious limits.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Field bosses were weaker than quest bosses or dungeon bosses, and their item drop rate was also low.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid and the Overgeared members hunted one large cactus and two golden toads, but only obtained two epic items and five enhancement stones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Grid was feeling disappointment, “River!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We've finally arrived!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group arrived at the Hebend River.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was only 10 hours from Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>If they fully exploited Huroi’s scouting ability, they would’ve been able to arrive within three hours. However, Grid made their journey at least three times longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid, all the guild members are tired. It’s late at night, so why don’t we take a break?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Pon suggested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid checked the status of the Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I understand. Get ready to camp.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stamina recovery was slow outdoors.&nbsp;</span><span style>Meals and simple rest weren’t sufficient, so it was better to take a short nap.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members gathered near the river and pulled out a tents from the inventory. They were impressed when they saw Grid setting up his.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because Grid’s setting up skill wasn’t ordinary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wow, isn’t this great? It is the first time I’ve seen someone build a tent as quickly as Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Has he set up a lot of tents in reality? Does he go camping often?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What camping...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t have any friends to go camping with.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reason why Grid’s tent building skill was so good was because he was thoroughly trained in the army.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had over 3,000 dexterity points, so he could set up a tent several times faster than ordinary users.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Were there any advantages to building a tent quickly?&nbsp;</span><span style>No.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wouldn’t be helpful in reality unless he had a lover to go on a camping trip with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let's eat."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the setting up of tents was complete, the Overgeared members sat down in front of a fire.&nbsp;</span><span style>The food they prepared was common.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the rainbow potato, the only food currently grown in Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’m sick of eating this for every meal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I agree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rainbow potato had seven flavors. The red portion had a meat flavor, the yellow portion was fried shrimp flavor, the orange portion was tangerine sauce, and so on.&nbsp;</span><span style>It had a soft, strong or delicious taste, but in the end, it was just a potato.&nbsp;</span><span style>Basically, it was hard because they had to eat this for every meal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It would be nice if we had a good chef.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the case of a chef with high cooking skills, it was possible to make food using wild grasses and monsters. In addition, the dishes would give a small buff so it was a very useful ability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Euphemina can duplicate the cooking skill...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina wasn’t included in this raid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Currently, she was making a great contribution to the security and internal affairs development of Reidan by duplicating skills like the monster taming, blacksmithing, alchemy, building, etc.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was too much to rely on her for cooking as well, so Grid shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘We can’t always depend on Euphemina.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She might leave the guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>In fact, there was a limit to relying on only one person, so Grid decided that it was better to recruit users with various secondary classes like chefs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now my eyes are tired.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What should we do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guild members finished their meal.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid rose from his spot and proclaimed,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Leave the lookout position to me. Everybody, you should get a good sleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had matured and was now sacrificing himself for his colleagues.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the Overgeared members refused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid is the core power of this raid group. You can’t overdo it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't worry. I’m still okay because I have a lot of stamina.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It isn’t enough just to be okay. You have to be well prepared. The opponent is strong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Grid was excluded from being on guard and the members started to consult among themselves.&nbsp;</span><span style>The scheduled break was four hours.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the meantime, eight people should stand guard in intervals of 30 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The eight people with the highest stamina stat will have to sacrifice 30 minutes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The higher the stamina stat, the higher the maximum stamina and the quicker the recovery speed. Therefore, the guard positions were always taken by the tankers.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner and Toban groaned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m tired of being a tanker all day long...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A tanker is a sinner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It might be a reasonable method, but the tankers couldn’t help complaining.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel watched them and made a wise suggestion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why doesn’t Piaro stand guard?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the way here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It was obvious but Piaro didn’t take part in any battles. He just had to walk.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel guessed that Piaro still had a lot of stamina left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A legendary farmer should have high basic stats... A four hour guard shift shouldn’t be a huge burden to him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro readily nodded at Lauel’s suggestion.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I understand. Leave it to me and get a good night’s sleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The faces of the Overgeared members brightened.&nbsp;</span><span style>They didn’t know why Piaro participated in this raid, but they were delighted that he was here.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, some people showed negative reactions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is a danger zone, so we shouldn’t leave the guard position to a farmer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right. What if monsters hide in the fog at dawn and attack? A farmer wouldn’t be able to detect the attack of a monster, so we will be vulnerable to danger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They don’t know the honor it is to have a great swordsman standing guard...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid found this situation hilarious.&nbsp;</span><span style>How long would they mistake Piaro for a farmer? It was interesting to watch since he knew the truth.&nbsp;</span><span style>He smiled and settled the situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>“You shouldn’t doubt Piaro’s ability to be a lookout. Don’t you know that he is a legendary farmer, not an ordinary farmer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members were confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why should a legendary farmer be good at being a lookout?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Explain it so that we can understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was stressed because the members asked for clarification. It was impossible to give a convincing explanation since it was just a thoughtless remark that he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Lauel made a guess.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Farmers have to protect their fields from ice, beasts and monsters. A legendary farmer should have an excellent ability to defend his fields, meaning that his ability to sense beasts and monsters is sharp. This is the reason why Grid told us to trust the legendary farmer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid agreed with Lauel’s interpretation.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members with a negative reaction started to understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see... Farmers have this ability...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay then. Piaro, please work hard for four hours. It is a request.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members entered their tents.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pon was the last one to enter and he spoke to Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is a huge monster that lives in Hebend River. It’s extremely powerful, unlike the golden toads that we hunted during the day. If it emerges, let us know without any delay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon finally entered his tent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro sat in front of a campfire alone and recalled the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It reminds me of my days as a knight.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>During his time in the Red Knights, they went on many expeditions and set up campsites.&nbsp;</span><span style>At that time, he was with his colleagues.&nbsp;</span><span style>But due to Asmophel’s false accusation, they were all dead.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tadak.</span></i> <i><span style>Tak.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro was organizing the branches for the campfire when he suddenly shifted his gaze to the river.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was early dawn.&nbsp;</span><span style>Something was moving silently in the fog.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was hard to detect even by the most skilled person.&nbsp;</span><span style>But who was Piaro?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was extremely rare that anything could succeed in an ambush in front of a great swordsman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You are the monster of Hebend River.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro threw the branch he was holding into the river. As he threw it into the river, something let out a sharp scream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On this day.&nbsp;</span><span style>The top predator of the Hebend River for the last decade met its end.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Okay, perfect."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid and the Overgeared members slept for four hours and recovered enough stamina.&nbsp;</span><span style>They ate a rainbow potato and moved straight to their destination.&nbsp;</span><span style>They finally reached the edge of the mountains after passing through large and small ghost villages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid and the Overgeared members no longer encountered monsters.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was puzzled by the bamboo forest that stretched along the mountain path.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How was this forest preserved without being turned into a desert? Is this place safe from the giant worms?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel explained.&nbsp;</span><span style>“The doppelganger here blocks the path of monsters as well as humans. Thanks to it, this forest and the mine in the mountains behind it are safely preserved.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hrmm...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a strange phenomenon where a monster defended the land from another monster.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid felt great interest as he stepped into the bamboo forest.&nbsp;</span><span style>At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have entered the mysterious forest.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your mind has become calm.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You will be helpless in the midst of this tranquility.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh...! This feeling is so disgusting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I just want to sleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the exception of Grid, the Overgeared members were overcome by the helpless feeling. Their bodies became limp and they had pained expressions on their faces.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Grid kept moving forward and was astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Pagma?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The center of the forest where bamboo soared into the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>One man was sitting on a flat rock.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had an egg-shaped face on a slender body. White skin and red lips. His long eyes that were smiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He gave off such a beautiful and neat impression that it was hard to believe he was a man.&nbsp;</span><span style>He looked exactly like Pagma, who Grid had seen depicted on the murals at Loran Falls.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Pagma sat quietly on the rock and slowly moved.&nbsp;</span><span style>The silk clothes that seemed to come from the Joseon Era flapped as he moved and shifted his gaze towards Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The look in those eyes contained outright hostility. &nbsp;</span></p>
