 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Ms. Clarice’s presented work, the ‘Diamond Necklace that Causes a Slight Change in Sensation’ has been won for 453 gold. Mr. Grees’ presented work, ‘Cold Protection Inner Armor’ has been won for 189 gold. Mr. Piglet’s presented work, the ‘Bitter but Superior Strength Potion’ has been won for 15 gold each. Mr. Steng’s presented work, the ‘Long Sword that Easily Harmonizes with Magic’ has been won for 1,900 gold.”</p>
 <p><span style>The people whose items were won cheered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Steng also rejoiced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My teacher’s work was sold! Teacher will be very pleased!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stein would be given a new production method with this quest clear reward.&nbsp;</span><span style>He approached me with the intention of receiving congratulations, but my stomach hurt and my mouth didn’t open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Dammit. My items weren’t won after all... Shit, I should’ve made the price cheaper.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As I was trembling with anger and regret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Mr. Grid’s presented work, the ‘Very Delicate Plate Armor’ has been won for 3,500 gold. The ‘Seemingly Plain Gauntlets’ have been won for 2,000 gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I doubted my ears.&nbsp;</span><span style>Did he say 3,500 gold just now? It wasn’t 2,000 gold?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other people freaked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No way... How can an item be sold for such an expensive price?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected from epic items! The level limit is also over 100...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Steng sent me a look of envy.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Amazing! Your teacher must be an incredibly good blacksmith! Is he a blacksmith with the Advanced Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship skill? Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I couldn’t hear anything.&nbsp;</span><span style>The words ‘I made money’ and ‘jackpot’ echoed through my head.&nbsp;</span><span style>5,500 gold in cash was...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘6,600,000 won...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge sum that would require 73 days of labor was earned in just one week.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was also from two epic items!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Abo...aboooo...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I wanted to cheer, but my mouth wasn’t working well.&nbsp;</span><span style>The auctioneer spoke while I was completely baffled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Grid, the administrator wants to meet you. Follow me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Steng congratulated me.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Wow! Now you will be entitled to deliver goods to the castle. The smithy will become quite busy and the quests you will receive from your master will be enormous! Congratulations!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Steng was sincerely happy, unlike me who felt pained when I saw him doing well.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was still in his mid-teens, but he was very friendly.&nbsp;</span><span style>I liked it. Once I became the owner of the smithy, I would be sure to recruit him.&nbsp;</span><span style>He seemed like the type who wouldn’t complain over some unreasonable labor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Thank you for congratulating me. Then I’ll see you next time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I gave Steng the kindest smile possible as I looked forward to our reunion someday.&nbsp;</span><span style>Steng looked blue as he took a few steps back and replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, goodbye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I said goodbye to Steng and headed to the administrator’s office.&nbsp;</span><span style>The administrator was a middle-aged man.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had an impressive mustache and welcomed me warmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ohh, you’re Grid! I was very impressed after seeing your work. I was wondering how you became the smithy’s successor at such a young age, but I’m fully convinced after seeing your skills! Come, sit down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The administrator and I sat across from each other.&nbsp;</span><span style>A maid emerged with some tea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Wow...the scent of this Elpa tea is different.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fragrance of the Elpa tea that Khan made for me was very weak. I had to hold my nose to the cup in order to barely smell something. But the Elpa tea here was intensely spicy. I could enjoy the scene without putting my teacup to my nose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Expensive tea leaves are used.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When else would I get the opportunity to drink such expensive tea for free?&nbsp;</span><span style>I drained the hot tea and handed the empty cup to the maid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Another cup, please.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gulp.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“One more cup.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kya~~! One more cup!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Yes.”&nbsp;</span><span style>The administrator gave a hearty laugh after the fourth cup of tea.&nbsp;</span><span style>"According to the residents, you are someone with a heroic appearance... Yet you aren’t nervous at all in front of someone with a high position.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did I make a mistake?&nbsp;</span><span style>I belatedly realized, but the administrator shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Be as comfortable as you want. It’s fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Ah, yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The administrator seemed to be a person who didn’t like formalities.&nbsp;</span><span style>He cut to the chase.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I would like to distribute your equipment to the lady’s knights and soldiers, what do you think? Are you willing to do business with us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Okay, it finally came.&nbsp;</span><span style>I wanted to accept the deal right away, but there were a few things to keep in mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don't know if you know, but our smithy is doing extremely well right now. I will be busy, so I’m not sure if I will have enough time to make equipment for the knights and soldiers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I didn’t want to make equipment for the soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style>Considering the average level of the soldiers, I needed to make level 50 items, which wouldn’t make me a lot of money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I know for sure after this auction. The more high level the item limit, the greater the profit. It’s much better to make one level 120 item than a dozen level 50 items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The administrator nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see. Come to think of it, there is tremendous craftsmanship in your work. You probably invest quite a lot of time and effort every time you make an item. I was stupid to ask you to make hundreds or thousands of supplies for the soldiers. If so, I will change the criteria. Please just create equipment for the knights.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, I understand."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Good, the story was going well.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the administrator surprised me with his next words.&nbsp;</span><span style>“But I have a condition. The equipment to be distributed to the knights should be better than the works submitted to the auction today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two items submitted today had an epic rating.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, the administrator was telling me to deliver items above the epic rating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This crazy person. If I invest more than 20 hours every time I make an item, there isn’t any guarantee that I won’t get a normal rating.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The administrator spoke while I was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Of course, I know that making such great works is difficult. So I promise that I will buy it at a higher price.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A higher price...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It will be 10% more than the winning bids in today’s auction. Of course, it you make a work that is much better than the ones submitted today, I am willing to pay a higher price.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no need to listen any longer.&nbsp;</span><span style>I stood up and cried out.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Okay! I will return to the smithy right now. Then I’m going!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The administrator called me back while I was motivated to make items quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"First of all, please make me three swords. Some of the knights’ weapons have been compromised due to an incident not long ago.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the quest information rose up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Business with the Administrator (1)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Difficulty: A</span></p>
 <p><span style>Winston’s administrator, Vladi, has asked you to make equipment for the knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He has given you a good deal in consideration of your high skills. If you let him down, this business deal will be immediately destroyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Conditions: Make at least three epic rated swords with a level limit between 120~180, and deliver it within a week.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Rewards: Depends on the level of the items delivered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Failure: The business deal with the administrator is cancelled and the quest will be destroyed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Isn’t this quite good...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I invested 20 hours for each item over the past few days and made three items.&nbsp;</span><span style>Two of them had an epic rating and one had a normal rating.&nbsp;</span><span style>It meant I had a two-thirds chance of creating an epic item.&nbsp;</span><span style>It seemed possible to create three epic items in a week.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Unless my luck suddenly disappears and I don’t get any epic items, this is a quest that can definitely be cleared!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was filled with a strong confidence as I left the castle.&nbsp;</span><span style>As I walked along the road to the smithy, the residents approached me and whispered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Grid, some people are following you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right. You should be careful, because they might be bad people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My affinity with the residents was at the maximum so they showed me great favor.&nbsp;</span><span style>They would let me know if danger was approaching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Following me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who was it?&nbsp;</span><span style>I gazed in the direction that the residents indicated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>At the entrance of an alley, under the shade of a tree, behind a street vendors, etc. Suspicious people were hiding their bodies as much as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wow...aren’t a lot of people following me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I got goose bumps.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was I the target of a mysterious assassination organization like the protagonist of a movie?</span></p>
 <p><span style>... No, it didn’t seem like it when I looked closely.&nbsp;</span><span style>As I looked closely at the faces of those following me, I saw that they were people who were at the auction.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were following me to find out who my blacksmith was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I asked the residents.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Keep them from following me. There’s no need to worry, since they aren’t dangerous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The residents replied vigorously with resolute eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay. I do everything I can to help you!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Just leave it to me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The residents rolled up their sleeves.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dozens of them shouted at once. Then they ran towards those following me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-What? Why are they grabbing us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hiik! What is with these NPCs?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let go!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, things were quickly sorted out.&nbsp;</span><span style>I briefly thanked the residents and returned to the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style>After describing the situation to Khan, I logged out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hu... huhuhut!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The capsule room.&nbsp;</span><span style>I wasn’t able to suppress my laughter after emerging from the capsule.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Puhahahahat! I am now rich!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as I shouted, everything seemed like reality instead of a dream.&nbsp;</span><span style>I earned 6.6 million won in just one week!&nbsp;</span><span style>I also got the right to deliver items to the castle.&nbsp;</span><span style>My 10 million won debt would soon be paid off and I could escape from my debt-ridden status.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One day, I would be able to drive a foreign car!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Ahyoung will be sitting in the passenger seat!’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Huhuhu.</span></i><span style>..I couldn’t stop laughing from joy.&nbsp;</span><span style>I was so pleased that even tears emerged.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then an employee came up to me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Excuse me, you are being a nuisance to other customers, so please be quiet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I paid for the room and went home.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Shin Youngwoo left the capsule room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The employee clicked his tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A person like that is talking about being rich... He laughed while saying he is rich. There’s no doubt that he’s crazy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Doesn’t he seem jobless and homeless? Isn’t he wearing the same work clothes every day? Right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think so too... He regularly uses the capsule.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The student employees were talking about Shin Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style>Shin Youngwoo came to the capsule room early in the morning wearing the same clothes, so he seemed pathetic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I saw his member information, and he’s 26 years old right now. Tsk tsk, how pathetic is his life? I shouldn’t live like that after graduating from university.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Stop talking about that person and let’s talk about Satisfy. Did you know that I reached level 40 yesterday?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, really? Amazing! I’m still level 39. Hey, where are you levelling up so quickly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I was hunting. Fortunately, I obtained a rare item, so hunting became easier. I am faster due to the power of the item.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Where is an item for magicians? Ah ~ ~ ~ I want a rare item. Hey, what level do you think that homeless person is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Pff, look at him. Does he seem like he can play the game well? Satisfy is a world that is crueler than reality. A loser in reality has to be a loser in Satisfy. There’s no need to worry. He isn’t a high level user.”</span></p>
