 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[Your agility has increased by 10.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>After completing the deal with Chris.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid took the elixir without any delay, and his body felt lighter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strength: 2,790</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agility: 1,756</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There’s still a long way to go.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He needed to gain at least 104 levels in order to make the ratio of strength and agility 1:1.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid thought it was frankly out of the question.&nbsp;</span><span style>Amoract’s agent, Tallos.&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite the fact that he gained a huge 2.6 billion experience, he only gained one level. So how long would it take to gain 104 levels?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Every time my level increases, the amount of experience required increases too much. This is why a fourth advancement class hasn’t emerged even after one year.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, would it be possible for Kraugel to get a fourth advancement class in one year?&nbsp;</span><span style>His level was 319, which was four levels higher than the second place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A monster... That guy must be only hunting.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 1st ranked Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had never met him and never saw him on TV.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid acknowledged that his level up ability was unique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Anyway, it would be nice if I could frequently take the agility elixir.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an unrealistic wish.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elixirs were a rare potion. This type of transaction might not happen again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hrmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid looked at the location of his guild members.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Pavranium Expedition was still hunting in the remaining vampires cities.&nbsp;</span><span style>After raiding Elfin Stone, they got experience and item acquisition buffs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Wow... Pon and Regas are already level 308. Aren’t they accumulating a lot of experience? I should go back to the vampire cities.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Experience and item acquisition rate has increased by 5%. This effect only applies to the vampire cities. The time remaining is 25 days, 13 hours, 40 minutes and 15 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The next 25 and a half days. If I hunt while the buff is maintained...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Couldn’t he gain at least three levels and an elixir if he was lucky?&nbsp;</span><span style>The inspired Grid headed to the smithy before leaving.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had some work to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First of all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Item Creation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[What item do you want to create?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Armor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[What materials would you like to use?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blue orichalcum and black iron.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Please design the item.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A blank blueprint appeared in front of him.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was already the seventh design, so Grid was able to seamlessly design an armor.&nbsp;</span><span style>After a while, Grid completed the armor with a satisfactory appearance and explained the features of the item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This armor can never be pierced. It won’t get any scratches from a sword, and even a dragon’s breath won’t melt it."</span></p>
 <p><span style>[That isn’t possible. There are limits on the level of material and design used.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Indeed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as expected.&nbsp;</span><span style>The item penalty had disappeared, but his dream of arming himself with a weapon with 999,999,999 attack power and armor with &nbsp;999,999,999 defense was just a fanciful dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the first place, (Understanding of Gods’ Weapons) Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill was only level 6.&nbsp;</span><span style>The standards of an item that could be made with blue orichlacum and black iron was only slightly better than Failure.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past, Failure was created without taking into account the conditions of use.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This will change if I use pavranium as a mineral, but...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It needed to be on the level of Lifael’s Spear. Grid’s lacking design level was a big obstacle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Right now, it is better to use pavranium was a secondary item than an equipment item. It is urgent to obtain minerals better than blue orichalcum.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid realized this and summoned Minor, the minerals detector.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Find and report on any minerals that are superior to blue orichalcum.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? What is this?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Minor frowned at the words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Didn’t you promise to let me live as a miner if you collected all the pavranium!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Minor’s innate talents were more suited to minerals detection than mining.&nbsp;</span><span style>Minor’s grand ambition was to become a legendary miner that surpassed Gis and become the right arm of the emperor.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Minor trembled because Grid didn’t give him a chance to become a miner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid patted the boy’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Endure it a little longer. Don’t you know that I am a legendary blacksmith? I sincerely hope that you will become a great miner and give strength to me. But not yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuoh...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Minor gritted his teeth. There was poison in his eyes. This was truly the attitude of someone who would betray his master.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid inwardly tsked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He needs to know reality.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Minor’s talent was clearly outstanding. He had the qualities to be a huge miner. But it wasn’t enough to become a legendary miner. That’s what the Great Lord's Sword was telling him. In other words, Minor’s dream was useless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You are more suitable as a minerals detector.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ability of minerals detection was rare.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid occasionally observed the people of Winston Bairan and Reidan, but Minor was the only NPC with a minerals detection talent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid hoped that Minor would grow as a minerals detector and would become a great force for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hasn’t your mother’s health worsened in Bairan? I will talk to the lord of Bairan to give your mother the best treatment. Now Minor. If you want your mother to regain her health, go on an adventure. Find the best minerals. Fighting!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit...! Shit! This evil person!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Minor was only 14 years old.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid struck at the boy’s weakness, so he seemed evil.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid was convinced that this was the right way to deal with Minor.&nbsp;</span><span style>He believed that a life as a minerals detector would work out better for Minor than just being an excellent miner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Minor trembled and left.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Grid sent a whisper to Euphemina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>How many of the Water Clan King’s Tears did you obtain?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Four.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-Oh, that is a lot more than I thought?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Water Clan King’s Tears.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a rare material that permanently gave magic to an item.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a production material with a unique effect, but the Water Clan’s King only shed tears for one day every five months.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was surprised because Euphemina collected four tears in the three months after leaving for the Siren Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I was lucky.</span></i> <i><span style>I got a special quest.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-Special quest?</span></i> <i><span style>What is it?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Hehe, I’ll tell you later.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘She’s excited.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She must’ve gotten a fairly good quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid nodded with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Yes, I’m looking forward to the good news.</span></i> <i><span style>If you have any difficulties along the way, please feel free to contact me. First of all, place the tears in the guild’s warehouse.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid picked up the Water Clan King’s tears from the warehouse and started to smelt the pavranium.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>'A legendary item maker... This really exists!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris’s smile stretched from ear to ear after he made the deal with Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He might be in an unfavorable position to Grid, but what were the chances to get such a good item?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was safe to say that it wasn’t common.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s Greatsword transcended common sense, and it was more than what Chris wanted.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris was convinced that the performance was more than Kraugel’s White Fang and Seuron’s Brutal Heavy Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can use it until at least level 360.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t an exaggeration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s Greatsword was much better than the level 320 unique rated item that Chris acquired from a raid. Based on his analysis, he judged that level 350~360 items wouldn’t be as good as Grid’s Greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don’t have to worry about weapons for at least 10 months. But the situation is serious...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Didn’t it mean that Grid and the Overgeared members were armed with such items?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid seemed remarkably strong compared to other forces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Can they be left unchecked?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris was the master of the Giant Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted a higher position and to become a king, so that he could obtain the best wealth and power.&nbsp;</span><span style>From this standpoint, Grid was likely to be a big obstacle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris spoke to the Five Captains. (TL: Author uses the Five Captains as a title here, rather than using it to signify the number of people. So he will keep referring to them as the Five Captains, despite one being missing.)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris walked towards the gate with them when he suddenly felt doubts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mihara?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I haven’t seen him since three days ago, when he said he was going to Pedro first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mihara had been acting freely in Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>His capricious personality meant it wasn’t strange for him to return first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That guy. Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris suddenly stopped walking.&nbsp;</span><span style>The fields stretched out widely outside Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a farmer blocking their way?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the Five Captains, Asellas questioned the farmer who was blocking their path.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the farmer held out five hoes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Clear the ground.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was this farmer crazy?&nbsp;</span><span style>He appeared and told them to clear the ground?&nbsp;</span><span style>Everyone was speechless because it was so absurd, then Chris spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why should we help you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The farmer, Piaro’s, logic was simple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your companion dared touch a maid of Duke Grid’s. You failed to properly control your companion, so now you will help develop Reidan’s agriculture.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their companion molested a maid?&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris and the Five Captains were feeling disbelief when they remembered Mihara.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'That stupid brat is doing something trashy again...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mihara always caused incidents in the past.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris sighed and nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I understand what you want to say. I will punish the one who touched the maid. Don’t be too angry and open the path.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris thought the farmer called Piaro was doing some type of performance.&nbsp;</span><span style>He thought it was the cry of a weak farmer who knew about Mihara’s sin.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it was a misconception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I have already punished him, so now you have to work in the fields.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Asellas raised his voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why do you keep talking nonsense? This is a viscount of the Eternal Kingdom and master of the Giant Guild, Chris! You shouldn’t even look him in the eyes, so how can you skip etiquette and even ask him to work in the fields?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been a long time since they started Satisfy, and they hadn’t interacted with farmers for a while.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro looked indifferently at Asellas, who was seething with anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I watched from afar, and you didn’t show any politeness towards Duke Grid. I’m just following your rude behavior.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rude behavior...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike NPCs, etiquette didn’t play a huge role between users.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris and the Five Captains had to bow and be polite to Duke Grid?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was impossible.&nbsp;</span><span style>The five people thought that the farmer wasn’t aware of reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get lost!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their ankles couldn’t be grabbed by a farmer forever.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asellas pushed the farmer. No, it was a shove.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eek?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asellas’ eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to grab the wrist of the farmer, but his vision instantly changed to that of the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is this...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asellas lay on the ground while the Five Captains were amazed, Chris as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Reidan’s monster farmer...! He really exists!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They believed it was a rumor, but now they knew it wasn’t the case.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris felt a great interest and grabbed Grid’s Greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re the one who knocked down Zibal? Those skills, show them to me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason why the alliance of the seven guilds, except for the Giant Guild, failed to invade Reidan was due to the unidentified farmers.&nbsp;</span><span style>A farmer who was strong enough to knock down the 2nd ranked Zibal, what if Chris beat him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>After obtaining a second class, the 3rd ranked Chris believed that he was stronger than Zibal.&nbsp;</span><span style>He rushed towards Piaro.</span></p>
