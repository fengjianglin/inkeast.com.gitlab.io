 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The 31 year old Kim Doohyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Korea’s top star had an outstanding appearance and a proven performance in Hollywood.&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite his busy schedule, he steadily played Satisfy and finally arrived at the desert city of Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How exciting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kim Doohyun, who only just reached level 197, ‘Nyangmong’ was deeply moved.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was hard to cross the scorching desert that contained powerful monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I was a normal class user, I would’ve never been able to make it through the desert.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nyangmong was a pet master.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a unique class, he possessed useful skills and it couldn’t be denied that he was a master of solo play.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An average person could have three pets, but he could have nine. He could even temporarily make monsters friendly, so the monsters in the desert might be strong, but they couldn’t block his way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they were nothing in front of some farmers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is immensely large.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Outside Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vast rice fields stretched out from the outer walls into the horizon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid is the owner of this big city. A duke’s authority is beyond my imagination.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, there was something admirable about someone who was the best in their field.&nbsp;</span><span style>He could feel how great Grid truly was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He must’ve worked hard in order to climb up to his present place.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nyangmong had also undergone countless trials in order to become a top star. Therefore, he had a shallow idea of Grid’s life.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid might be younger than him, but it was respectable, regardless of age.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Step, step.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>His footsteps were light as he walked through the rice fields.&nbsp;</span><span style>He hummed as he thought about soon being able to meet Noe.&nbsp;</span><span style>A farmer blocked his cheerful humming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who are you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nyangmong was just walking along. He couldn’t think of anything in his behavior that would’ve caused wariness.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then why was this person blocking the road?&nbsp;</span><span style>Nyangmong was confused by the farmer’s question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I am called Nyangmong...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The farmer closely observed Nyangmong.&nbsp;</span><span style>To be precise, he looked at the nine pets following Nyangmong.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was surprising that the various pets were showing absolute loyalty and affection towards Nyangmong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I covet your talent. The giant oaks can be used for farming.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Farming?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was strange that a farmer would say that to someone passing by.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>Nyangmong didn’t know about the crazy farmer of Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had a busy schedule and played Satisy whenever he was free, so he couldn’t watch TV.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’m not a farmer. Please open the path. I have to go to Reidan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You aren’t permitted to enter Reidan without my permission.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why? Are you the owner of this land?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The owner of this land is Duke Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then why should I get your permission?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s my heart."</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is he crazy?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nyangmong seriously felt doubts.&nbsp;</span><span style>He felt like there was nothing good about the farmer in front of him.&nbsp;</span><span style>The farmer caught up to him while he was trying to run away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while.&nbsp;</span><span style>Nyangmong and his lovely nine pets were brutally destroyed by the farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style>From Nyangmong’s standpoint, it was truly absurd and unreasonable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>G-Grid, I finally arrived in Reidan. But I was caught by a mad farmer and forced to become a serf.</span></i> <i><span style>Help me...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[The other person is in a place where they can’t receive whispers.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Ruby, help me...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[The other person isn’t connected to the game.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Follow me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the day when the professional cattle man was born in Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a unique class, his abilities were excellent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Reidan’s agriculture was becoming stronger day by day.&nbsp;</span><span style>Nyangmong also became stronger.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was still inadequate to join Overgeared, but he grew rapidly thanks to the ‘★Hidden Quest★ Fun and Exciting Training!’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[You have entered the 11th island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>He disabled the lightning storm by making a huge lightning rod.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid broke through the notorious tenth island in a smart manner, but he was still restless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Other blacksmiths could’ve come up with the same idea as me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t special.&nbsp;</span><span style>He repeated that painful truth many times.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it was also encouraging.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had managed to think about a way to break through compared to the old days when he couldn’t think of ideas by himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yes, let’s grow slowly.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s eyes filled with an emotion he didn’t have in the past.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a phenomenon where he became aware of his lack of talent and tried to become wiser.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Somehow, my head is clear.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the moment when his way of thinking started to expand.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Grid was evolving.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t a cataclysmic thing.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the fruit of his steady progress over the past two years as Pagma’s Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was this impossible?&nbsp;</span><span style>No, it was possible.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid wasn’t dull-witted.&nbsp;</span><span style>Every human was able to broaden their thoughts and knowledge through learning, experience, and self-reflection.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That reminds me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was it because his thinking ability was higher than before?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had a new question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What’s on the last island?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason why Grid visited the Behen Archipelago was to meet Sage Sticks, but the ultimate content of the archipelago wasn’t Sticks.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sticks was located on the 25~29th islands.&nbsp;</span><span style>Not the last island.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, what was on the 66th island and why did the Behen Archipelago called them ‘challengers?’&nbsp;</span><span style>With the benefit of hindsight, he noticed the name ‘Challenger Point.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s a question that can be resolved when I meet Sticks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was foolish to waste his thoughts on meaningless things that he couldn’t figure out alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>Once he met Sticks, he would obtain the way to the East Continent was well as figure out what was on the 66th island.&nbsp;</span><span style>He should directly ask Sticks any questions he had.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A notification window popped up in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A mission will be created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[11th Island]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Defeat the lizardwoman!</span></p>
 <p><span style>First Clear Reward: 36 Challenger Points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The mission will start 30 minutes from now.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lizardwoman.&nbsp;</span><span style>The lizardwoman was the boss monster that lizardmen served, and her value was quite high.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reason was that she dropped the Pink Leather necessary for making the finest leather armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hrmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had a chance to raid the lizardwoman, which was difficult to see easily, but he didn’t show much inspiration.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was it because he didn’t know the value of pink leather?&nbsp;</span><span style>No, that wasn’t it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid also knew about the value of the pink leather. He’d even dealt with it directly. Every time Faker asked Grid to make him an item, pink leather was needed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason why Grid didn’t show any inspiration was because based on previous experience, the monsters of the Behen Archipelago didn’t drop any items.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>The monsters that emerged on the Behen Archipelago was merely a collection of experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was disappointing, but Grid didn’t mind.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reason he first visited the Behen Archipelago wasn’t to obtain items, but to meet Sticks.&nbsp;</span><span style>He just had to move forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid used Fly and observed the location of the lizardmen village from the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a large village with 207 huts that could accommodate a few lizardmen at once.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was able to roughly guess the number of lizardmen, and he continued to observe the village to point out the important areas.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There are three ponds.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He calculated all the variables involved in hunting a powerful lizardwoman and a large number of lizardmen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid moved hastily to take advantage of his 30 minute preparation time, taking out his blast furnace and smelting iron.&nbsp;</span><span style>He made a large iron plate that was over 20m in diameter.&nbsp;</span><span style>An ordinary blacksmith would need several hours to spread the iron so much.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid was a legendary blacksmith. He even had the four God Hands.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid and the God Hands hammered at the iron plate.&nbsp;</span><span style>After a while, he completed three iron plates and moved to the lizardman’s village again.&nbsp;</span><span style>His timing was perfect as the notification window popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The mission has started!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, lizardmen popped out of the 297 huts. There was close to 1,000 of them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid witnessed the sight and shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Noe, Randy! Help the God Hands cover the pond with these plates! I will cover you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand, Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nyahahat! Master, believe in me!” Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Transcend flew towards the lizardmen on the path towards the pond.&nbsp;</span><span style>Some of the lizardmen hurriedly raised their shields to save their lives, but others were sliced apart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kieek!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kyaack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The screams of the lizardmen filled the village as blood splattered.&nbsp;</span><span style>But there were too many lizardmen.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t rest as he wielded his two greatswords, but the number of enemies didn’t decrease.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The lizardmen narrowed the distance to Grid, who kept attacking.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Huuuuuuong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The God Hands, Noe, and Randy finally blocked the three ponds with the iron plates.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kik?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The lizardmen were amazed by the sound of iron plates falling.&nbsp;</span><span style>The ponds that amplified their strengths were hidden.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>The lizardmen were monsters who received stat bonuses from water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was reminded of this trait when observing the village, and covered all the ponds in the village with the iron plates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Transcended Link!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kyaack!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kieeeek!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The level of the lizardmen warriors living in the same village as the lizardwoman was quite high at 230.&nbsp;</span><span style>But they didn’t receive any stat bonuses, making it hard to endure Grid’s attacks. Their shields were also useless.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid used his most powerful skills with the +8 Grid’s Greatsword, before handing it to the God Hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he took out Iyarugt and cut at the lizardmen with Noe and Randy.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kyaaaak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The lizardwoman grasped the situation and came out with a roar.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was quite strong as a level 300 field boss, but it was lacking compared to Hell Gao and Elfin Stone, and Grid was stronger than ever.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 11th island was easily cleared and Grid continued up to the 20th island.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the 20th island was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thousands of eyes floated in a huge circle in the sky like a sun, watching Grid. He couldn’t help gulping at the sight.</span></p>
