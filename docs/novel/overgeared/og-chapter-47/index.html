 <p><span>Chapter 47</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <hr>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><em><span>Pahat!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Leo narrowed the distance towards Grid with quick movements.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid wanted to step back, but Leo was already in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Leo aimed a flashy blow towards the panicked Grid.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kaaang!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Grid raised his dagger and barely managed to defend against Leo’s attack.&nbsp;</span><span>His wrists and shoulders were strained in the aftermath, and his right arm was temporarily disabled, but Grid survived thanks to the successful defense.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I wouldn’t have caught Leo’s movements at all if it weren’t for the Ideal Dagger.’</span></p>
 <p><span>This was true.&nbsp;</span><span>After using the skill ‘Quick Movements’ attached to the Ideal Dagger, his agility doubled. Ideal Dagger itself increased the user’s agility by 20.&nbsp;</span><span>In addition to that, all of Grid’s stats had increased by 12 points after making a unique item.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid’s combined agility was close to 250 points, making him able to respond to Leo’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span>Leo frowned with an unpleasant expression and asked,</span></p>
 <p><span>“You avoided my attack? Aren’t you a blacksmith?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Leo was one of Winston’s most accomplished young talents.&nbsp;</span><span>He was even called the ‘Northern Nova’ and his name was spread throughout the north.&nbsp;</span><span>It was impossible for an ordinary blacksmith to block his attack, even with a fluke.</span></p>
 <p><span>Thus, Leo started taking the battle seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span>“You aren’t an ordinary blacksmith? Were you just acting in the interrogation room? Good, I will acknowledge your skills and do my best.”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Hwaruruk!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Red flames emerged from Leo’s longsword. It was a magic sword equipped with the fire attribute.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid, who had been hoping there was a slight chance of victory, felt despair again.</span></p>
 <p><span>“A magic sword...! Why is a strong person using something like that? This is a foul!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The time limit for rescuing Huroi was 25 minutes.&nbsp;</span><span>Could he defeat a knight equipped with a magic sword?&nbsp;</span><span>It was impossible.&nbsp;</span><span>He would be killed in a minute.</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid was completely lost.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I have to run away. At this rate, I will die a dog’s death and fail the quest. Running away is the only option. But how can I run?’</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid couldn’t outrun the knight. The physical abilities of a knight transcended him.&nbsp;</span><span>It might be possible if he had a skill that gave the target an abnormal condition, but Grid was a blacksmith and didn’t have such useful skills.</span></p>
 <p><span>In the end, Grid was destined to be killed here by Leo.&nbsp;</span><span>But at that moment, something happened that no one could predict.&nbsp;</span><span>There was suddenly a huge explosion in the spot where Leo was standing.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>“Wah!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid fell as flat as possible in order to avoid being affected by the aftermath of the explosion.&nbsp;</span><span>However, the explosion was so big that it was impossible for his body to not be damaged.</span></p>
 <p><span>[You have suffered 17,300 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[A legend doesn’t die easily. You can resist all attacks for 5 seconds with a minimum of health.]</span></p>
 <p><span>He had one health point remaining.&nbsp;</span><span>After a moment, the explosions stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Ugh... what happened all of a sudden...”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid rose from his spot and drank a potion to replenish his health before looking at the collapsed Leo.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Cough! Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Leo coughed up blood. He was in a miserable condition.&nbsp;</span><span>Leo’s silver majestic armor was in pieces and his body was covered in burns. It was a miracle that he was even breathing.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘What on earth happened?’</span></p>
 <p><span>When Leo exploded, Grid thought that Euphemina had appeared. He believed it was Euphemina’s magic that hit Leo.&nbsp;</span><span>However there were no signs of Euphemina at all, and there were still only two people here, Grid and Leo.</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid was stunned by the situation and immediately confirmed the status of Leo’s sword.&nbsp;</span><span>Leo’s sword had completely shattered. This meant it received the most damage from the explosion. It was as if the explosion began from Leo’s sword.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It can’t be...”&nbsp;</span><span>Grid thought rapidly.</span></p>
 <p><span>This was underground.&nbsp;</span><span>There was no wind because there was no ventilation and the ceiling collapsed due to Euphemina triggering the trap, filling the air with dust.&nbsp;</span><span>What would happen if a fire started in this enclosed space?</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid was reminded of the dust explosion that his chemistry teacher taught him in high school.&nbsp;</span><span>Dust explosion was a phenomenon where dust was concentrated in the air and exploded after receiving heat and pressure.&nbsp;</span><span>In the past, there were insufficient dust explosion prevention methods and this phenomenon frequently occurred in coal mines, mills and other areas.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Ha! What? It’s like&nbsp;</span><em><span>that</span></em><span>? Pfff! Puhahahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid relaxed as he grasped the situation and then laughed like crazy.&nbsp;</span><span>He was really lucky to be able to succeed in the quest after thinking he would be killed by Leo.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Uhh... you... what did you do?”</span></p>
 <p><span>The collapsed Leo could barely open his mouth to ask.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid stopped laughing and turned to Leo. He tried to look as cool as possible as he declared.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This is what you call the difference in skills. In fact, I moved at a tremendous speed that your eyes couldn’t follow and made your sword explode. That is why you can’t avoid death.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“W-What? Such a thing is possible? You... what is your identity?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid placed the dagger above Leo’s heart and replied,&nbsp;</span><span>“I am Pagma’s Descendant. Now you really are going to be a bachelor ghost.”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Puk.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Grid’s dagger pierced Leo’s heart.&nbsp;</span><span>His words came true. Leo really was going to be a bachelor ghost!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Kwaaaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Leo turned into a grey light and dozens of notification windows emerged in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span>[You have defeated Winston’s knight, Leo.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The title ‘Knight Slayer’ has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span><span>[8&nbsp;</span></span><span id="footnote-8">gold has been acquired.]</span><span><span><a href="#footnote-8" id="footnoteref-8"></a></span></span></p>
 <p><span>[The prison key has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[432,000 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Your level...]</span></p>
 <p><span>The level of ‘Northern Nova’ Leo was exactly 188.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid’s level rose from 21 to 45 in an instant. There was also a bonus title.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Knight Slayer]</span></p>
 <p><span>Stamina +100. Strength +30&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>"Ohhhhhhhh!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Knight Slayer was the easiest title to obtain because it was received after killing a knight.&nbsp;</span><span>However, it was necessary to be skilled to take down a knight. So it wasn’t a title that could be obtained unless the person had a high-level.&nbsp;</span><span>Yet Grid, who was level 21, killed a knight and acquired the Knight Slayer title.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I received the title of Knight Slayer, which is one of the indications of a high-level user...!’</span></p>
 <p><span>He never dreamed of getting the Knight Slayer title, even in his days as a warrior.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid enjoyed the thrill as he started running.&nbsp;</span><span>Then he reached the end where Huroi’s voice had been heard.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Huroi, I’m here!”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Ching!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The iron door easily opened due to the key from Leo.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Ugh!”&nbsp;</span><span>Grid frowned. The solitary cell was filled with a bad stench. And Huroi didn’t look the same. It was like touching a skeleton.&nbsp;</span><span>“What? You... You are Huroi right? Why do you look so different? What have you been doing in the meantime?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid originally planned to hit Huroi’s cheeks 200 times, but Huroi’s condition was so bad that he didn’t dare.&nbsp;</span><span>It wasn’t because of his conscience.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Won’t he die immediately if he is slapped? I don’t want to be stigmatized as a criminal and player killer.’</span></p>
 <p><span>“...You?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huroi slowly opened his eyes in the darkness. Then he looked at Grid.&nbsp;</span><span>At that moment, Huroi was able to recall who he was, where he was and what type of quest he was completing.</span></p>
 <p><span>"You... you are my saviour... Thank you... thank you...”</span></p>
 <p><span>Then a notification window flashed in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Quest success!]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Title, ‘Apostle of Justice’ has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The courage stat has opened.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[All stats have increased by 10.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The skill ‘Unbreakable Justice’ has been generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Your reputation in Winston has reached the peak. In the future, the Winston residents will show you the best hospitality.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Affinity with the Winston residents has risen to the maximum. In the future, the Winston residents will share things with you.]</span></p>
 <p><span>Huroi also had notification windows appear in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Quest success!]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The second class ‘Apostle of Justice’s Partner’ has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The courage stat has opened.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[When you are with the Apostle of Justice, all stats will increase by 20%.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The skill ‘Unbreakable Justice’ has been generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The skill ‘Sacrifice for Justice’ has been generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Title, ‘One who Overcomes Hardships’ has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Indomitable stat has opened.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The skill ‘Strong Will’ has been generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Congratulations! You are the first to obtain a second class in Satisfy. If you wish, your achievements will last for a long time in Satisfy.]</span></p>
 <p><span>"Ah...!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Tears poured from Huroi’s eyes.&nbsp;</span><span>He was thrilled at receiving these rewards after the hellish ordeal.&nbsp;</span><span>Huroi used all his strength and barely raised his body. Then he fell to his knees in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Grid, I didn’t know it when we met but we clearly have a destined relationship. My saviour, Grid! I Allunbata, descendant of the Blue Wolf, will follow you for the rest of your life as the Apostle of Justice’s Partner!”</span></p>
 <p><span>‘What is this?’</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid didn’t know the details and just thought Huroi was crazy.&nbsp;</span><span>But Huroi was sincere.&nbsp;</span><span>Huroi dismissed Grid when they met a few days ago, but now he was convinced that Grid was his destiny.&nbsp;</span><span>He vowed to repay the favour to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span>Thus, the relationship between the two men began in earnest.</span></p>
