 <p><span style>Chapter 262</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>After accepting Damian’s request, Grid received administrative reports from Rabbit and the Overgeared Guild. It couldn’t be helped. It was the least he had to do as the lord.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a result, one hour passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m tired.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatigue accumulated over his five week quest was too high. The problem was the lack of sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grid, are you departing for the Vatican?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Outside the meeting room.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian came up to him and asked.&nbsp;</span><span style>His eyes shone brightly and Grid waved his hands at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I have to rest first. I will contact you later, so head to the Vatican first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Frankly, Damian wanted Grid to go to the Vatican right now. His heart hurt when he thought of Isabel, who was suffering at this moment.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he couldn’t rush Grid and obediently stepped back.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had been waiting a few months, so couldn’t he wait a day or two?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He bowed politely to Grid who logged out. Then Grid headed straight to bed.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Since the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>10 months of Satisfy time had passed and Yura had dedicated herself to only one quest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Path of Penance]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Difficulty Level: SS</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meet the First Servant unharmed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Rewards: ???</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a quest that didn’t give her any clues.&nbsp;</span><span style>During the quest, Yura had to face countless adversities. She had experienced frustration several times.&nbsp;</span><span style>But she didn’t give up.&nbsp;</span><span style>If she was a person to give up easily, then she wouldn’t have become 5th in the unified rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her tenacity and obsession exceeded the category of ordinary people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I finally found it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dirt and blood didn’t cause Yura’s beauty to fade.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was still beautiful at the end of the long struggle, when she finally reached her destination. It was hard to find one flaw with her beautiful white skin and ebony hair.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Step step.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Deep in the cave.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura climbed onto the altar in the middle of the cave.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a pure white flame on the altar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Lovely child, you have reached this place with your weak human body.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was this the voice of an angel?&nbsp;</span><span style>A very sweet and beautiful voice came from the flame.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura’s eyes trembled. Her long eyelashes quivered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘My guess was right.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything about Yatan’s First Servant was veiled.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wasn’t a human.&nbsp;</span><span style>The evidence?&nbsp;</span><span style>The white flame in front of her.&nbsp;</span><span style>The identity of this flame was the soul of a demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You are entitled to receive my, Amoract’s, power.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demon of conflict, Amoract.&nbsp;</span><span style>One of the 33 great demons was Yatan’s First Servant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Demon, demonic views, religion founded by a demon.&nbsp;</span><span style>That was the Yatan Church.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were many hints.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The aim of the Yatan Church was to bring the 33 great demons to the earth.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yatan’s servants included the demonkin Balak and others.&nbsp;</span><span style>Legend said that the 33 great demons were creatures of God Yatan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Combining all these features, it wasn’t a religion that existed for humans.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was obvious that the Yatan Church was the enemy of humanity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Child, I will give you infinite power.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amoract enticed her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[I will help you break away from that weak human body.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then a notification window popped up in front of Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The quest ‘Path of Penance (SS)’ has been cleared.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[If you accept Amoract’s magic power, you will be changed from human to half demonkin. Demonkin can evolve into demons.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Will you accept Amoract’s magic power?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m being given a choice?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She could choose if she wanted the compensation or not. It was unheard of for the quest to leave it up to the user.&nbsp;</span><span style>What did this suggest?&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura’s brain was activated.&nbsp;</span><span style>Based on the information and experience that she had accumulated over the years, her high intelligence quickly analyzed the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura found the answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll refuse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amoract’s soul was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style>It shook at the unexpected choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Child, why? Why are you refusing my power?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Child, do you intend to betray God Yatan?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>After becoming a black magician and joining the Yatan Church.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura had committed many wrongdoings. This was the fate of a black magician.&nbsp;</span><span style>The quests given to black magicians always required causing conflict or harming people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did she feel guilty?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was uncomfortable, but it was a level that she could endure.&nbsp;</span><span style>Satisfy was essentially a game. It was different from reality.&nbsp;</span><span style>She had a clear distinction between good and evil, and she wasn’t evil.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura just faithfully played her role as a user who chose the path of evil. The result was that she became Yatan’s Servant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now she felt irritated.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was she belatedly feeling guilty?&nbsp;</span><span style>No.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I intend to betray you. If I accept your strength and remain God Yatan’s Servant forever, I will eventually become the enemy of that man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Man? Who are you talking about?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura’s clear eyes pierced into Amoract’s soul.&nbsp;</span><span style>“The Yatan Servants’ Slaughterer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[What?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long ago, Yura received the news that Grid killed Dark Bus, making it a total of three Yatan Servants.&nbsp;</span><span style>It had been a long time since the Yatan Church designed Grid as an enemy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura didn’t want to support the Yatan Church anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style>But she couldn’t leave the Yatan Church. It was a foolish act, since she would lose everything she obtained so far.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now the situation changed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why did a choice exist for a SS-grade quest reward?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was easy to guess.&nbsp;</span><span style>If she refused the compensation, she could get a corresponding ‘hidden reward.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yatan’s Servant, I will quit. In fact, I didn’t like Yatan from the beginning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She just chose a black magician because it seemed interesting. If she knew that she had to unconditionally serve God Yatan, she wouldn’t have become a black magician in the first place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Disgraceful girl!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amoract’s warm and gently voice changed to something terrible. The momentum alone seemed like it could kill Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Yura didn’t shrink back.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was well aware that it wasn’t possible for Amoract to appear on the earth at this time.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttiring.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[You have refused Amoract’s magic power.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have been deprived of your position as Yatan’s Servant.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You are expelled from the Yatan Church.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have lost your black magic power.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Yatan Church will be forever hostile to you.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The legendary class, Demon Slayer, has been obtained.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your level has dropped.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You are now level 1.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh my.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had expected to get a legendary class. However, she had no idea that she would drop to level one.&nbsp;</span><span style>The list of newly acquired skills appeared in front of the surprised Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On this day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura’s name disappeared from the list of rankers.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course it was a big topic. All types of speculation occurred across the world.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>He woke up at 4:30 in the morning.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had slept for 13 hours.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo exited his room with a blank expression, where his parents greeted him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Son! Why is it so hard to see you when we live in the same house?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It has been 10 days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo’s parents were farmers who grew crops and sold them at their vegetable store. They went to work early in the morning and came home late at night.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Youngwoo spend most of his day in the capsule. In particular, he had been playing for an exceptionally long time during the past 12 days because of the quest.&nbsp;</span><span style>It couldn’t be helped that it was hard for the three people to see each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard Youngwoo’s story on the news a few days ago. I know that you are busy doing big things, but don’t overdo it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Take care of your health. I’m concerned because you haven’t been exercising recently. If you get sick, we won’t be the only ones who will feel sad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A big deal... The nation...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo was treated as a hero after raising the status of South Korea in the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>To be honest, he still hadn’t adapted to it. It was too big of a gap from when he was taunted as a game obsessed loser.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have become successful in my field.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It felt good. He was very proud of it, especially when he saw how proud his parents were of him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo was stretching while listening to their words, when he suddenly wondered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I appeared on the news?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, there was something about how the seven or eight guilds invaded your city?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Youngwoo, you and your colleagues repelled them without any damage?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Asura? Ashur? Some unbelievably great earl helped you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The experts who appear on TV praise our son every day. Ohoho.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo was confused as soon as he woke up.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t understand anything the two people were saying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Roughly speaking... An alliance of seven guilds tried to invade Reidan and it seems like they were defeated by Earl Ashur.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why didn’t he know about this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘That Lauel.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ‘little thing’ he talked about was referring to this incident.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It was trivial.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was able to guess why the Overgeared Guild didn’t report this incident to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There was no damage, so it wasn’t important.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t want to disturb his quest. Then when he returned from completing the quest, he was too tired to stay connected for long.&nbsp;</span><span style>He could feel that his companions’ thoughts towards him were growing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I reap what I sow.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, Shin Youngwoo was filled with poison and only concerned about himself.&nbsp;</span><span style>At that time, he was always alone. He didn’t respect anyone. He didn’t care for others.&nbsp;</span><span style>But not anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style>After he succeeded, he could afford to care for others, and as a result, he was respected.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now he could call them ‘friends.’ These were truly happy days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hasn’t it been a while?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He finished eating breakfast with his parents.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Sehee greeted him as she came out of the bath.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her sister had become prettier in the short time they hadn’t seen each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have grown...”&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo said as he looked at her from head to toe, causing Sehee to blush.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Where are you looking like a pervert?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pervert?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why should he be called a pervert when he was just confirming his sister’s growth?&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee threw a white sweatshirt towards the bewildered Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Now that you have some time to relax, shouldn’t you go exercising?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is that so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the last 12 days, he hadn’t moved his body except when he was doing some light stretches and push-ups.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was frustrating, so Youngwoo was pleased that his sister offered to go running with him. He went out after a long time and ran excitedly. Youngwoo’s body and spirit felt refreshed from the clean air entering his lungs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then they returned home.&nbsp;</span><span style>A man was waiting at their house for Youngwoo..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s the first time that we’ve met in reality.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Mine... No, Peak Sword.</span></p>
