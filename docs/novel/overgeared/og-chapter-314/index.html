 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>So far, Grid only considered the performance when it came to item creation and production.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was understandable.&nbsp;</span><span style>Items were things that existed for the convenience of the user and to increase their stats.&nbsp;</span><span style>The most important factor for an item was the performance, and Grid always considered this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the circumstances were different this time.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had to make an item for someone who wasn’t a colleague, but a potential enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It will be sickening if a future enemy is armed with the most powerful item I have created.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t refuse the deal.&nbsp;</span><span style>If so, he needed to set up a device so that Chris wouldn’t become an enemy.&nbsp;</span><span style>How?&nbsp;</span><span style>The conclusion he came to after a long period of thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I need to make the buyer of the item dependent on the creator.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But how?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid came up with a simple yet dramatic solution.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This item can only be repaired by the maker.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The absolute maker of the item!&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s Greatsword would establish a relationship between the maker and buyer, and it would be effective as a type of slave contract.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I need to make a complicated structure so that only the maker can repair it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Designing it wasn’t a problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am a legendary blacksmith.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Magician Braham had said it.&nbsp;</span><span style>A legend was a transcendental presence. Don’t make a wall himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will design an item that no one can imitate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid encouraged morale by copying Braham’s tone.&nbsp;</span><span style>He grabbed the thought, used Item Creation and designed Grid’s Greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a practical design that excluded beauty.&nbsp;</span><span style>He considered the balance between performance and usage conditions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The strengths were combined.&nbsp;</span><span style>It contained a distinctiveness.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was faithful to the basics while bringing out the best performance.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttiring~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>His design was finished after struggling for half a day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[’Grid’s Greatsword’ has been added to the list of item production methods!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was satisfied.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s Greatsword</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Unique ~ Legendary</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unique Rating Information:</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 575/575</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attack Power: 953~1,191</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attack Speed: -5%</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a low probability of blocking the enemy’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a certain probability of activating the ‘3 Joint Attacks’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The damage of slashing attacks will increase by 20%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Skill damage will increase by 10%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Attack power +20% in dark places.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* It you hit the same target six times, the sixth attack will unconditionally be a critical attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Legendary Rating Information:</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 840/840</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attack Power: 1,274~1,440</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attack Speed: -3%</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a certain probability of blocking the enemy’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a certain probability of activating the ‘3 Joint Attacks’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The damage of slashing attacks will increase by 30%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Skill damage will increase by 20%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Attack power +20% in dark places.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* It you hit the same target five times, the fifth attack will unconditionally be a critical attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* If you succeeded in linking a skill within 0.5 seconds of 3 Joint Attacks, additional damage will be inflicted on the target.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is a weapon designed by the legendary blacksmith Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a blind spot in the center of the blade, the content of black iron is increased to maximize the weight, and the cutting power is increased by adding blue orichalcum to both sides of the blade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is designed for the user’s convenience and is perfectly balanced, helping the user achieve the best swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>User Restriction: Level 300 or higher. More than 2,800 strength. Advanced Sword Mastery level 5 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* This item can only be repaired by the maker. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 1,540</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s Greatsword wasn’t better than Failure.&nbsp;</span><span style>The attack speed, maximum attack power and durability of Failure were all better than Grid’s Greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, the level limit of 300 was identical.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Grid appreciated Grid’s Greatsword more than Failure.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were many reasons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First of all, the design of Grid’s Greatsword was more efficient than Failure.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unlike Failure, which was inconvenient to use due to its excessive size, Grid’s Greatsword had a very appropriate size.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In addition, the minimum attack power of Grid’s Greatsword was far superior.&nbsp;</span><span style>When attacking a target, the minimum attack power was always guaranteed, unlike the maximum attack power.&nbsp;</span><span style>A weapon with a higher minimum damage was bound to have higher damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were also the options that increased slashing damage and skill damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was only one part where Grid’s Greatsword was worse than Failure.&nbsp;</span><span style>It had 3 Joint Attacks instead of 5 Joint Attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had done his best to pass on the merits of Failure onto Grid’s Greatsword, but it wasn’t a complete success.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Grid thought about it positively. </span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is fine. The terms of use might become ridiculously higher if it was 5 Joint Attacks.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was also a secret hidden in Grid’s Greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a deep groove across the center of the blade.&nbsp;</span><span style>It had a tremendous effect when used, but only Grid, who designed it, knew about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then let's get started.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smiled with satisfaction and stood in front of the furnace. Then he confirmed the number of minerals he currently had in stock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>29 blue orichalcum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>99 black iron.</span></p>
 <p><span style>1,290 iron ores.</span></p>
 <p><span style>32 mithril.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blue orichalcum was a mineral dropped only by the Guardian of the Forest.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a limit on the quantity that could be obtained, so it was virtually impossible for a person to have this much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Grid had Jishuka.&nbsp;</span><span style>While acting as ruler of Bairan, she steadily raided the Guardian of the Forest, gathered the blue orichalcum, and gave them all to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The value of her help couldn’t be converted to money, and Grid really appreciated her at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Thank you, Jishuka.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid felt thankful once again and started to melt the minerals in the furnace.&nbsp;</span><span style>His perfect understanding of the minerals and control of the temperature was engraved into the young blacksmiths.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘Finally...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Over the past two days, Grid dedicated himself to making the item.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a result, two greatswords were in front of him.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were black swords with a deep groove in the center, while the blades gave off a subtle blue light.&nbsp;</span><span style>The harmony of colors was luxurious and seemed to improve the quality itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, both were incomplete, as the handle wasn’t attached yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sigh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The handle was a length that could be grasped with both hands. Grid took a deep breath before combining it with the greatswords.&nbsp;</span><span style>The young blacksmiths felt doubts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why is he upset before combining the handles?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is something wrong?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young blacksmiths thought Grid had a deep meaning behind delaying the completion of the sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it was a misunderstanding.&nbsp;</span><span style>The present Grid was engulfed with fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What if both are completed with a unique rating...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid used 19 blue orichalcum and 44 black iron just to produce one greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Black iron was a relatively common mineral that could be obtained with money, but the blue orichalcum was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a rare mineral that could only be obtained once every three months.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What if he used 19 of them just for a unique rated greatsword to be produced?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was obvious why he was trembling with nervousness.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was also the ‘special event’ that would happen in exchange for making the 10th legendary item.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even if he received a penalty, Grid wanted this to be a legendary greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t always avoid legendary items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Please...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid strongly grasped the hammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘God, Buddha, Goddess Rebecca, God Yatan! Please give me good luck!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid even prayed to God Yatan!&nbsp;</span><span style>As everyone watched, he attached a handle to the two-handed greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>The result was amazing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have succeeded in making Grid’s Greatsword (Legendary)!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A legendary rated item was produced, so all stats have permanently risen by +10 and reputation throughout the continent has risen by +500.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have succeeded in making Grid’s Greatsword (Legendary)!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A legendary rated item was produced, so all stats have permanently risen by +10 and reputation throughout the continent has risen by +500.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh...! Ohh!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blacksmiths were unable to close their mouths as they watched the completion of the greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Khan was teary-eyed.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was pleased because Grid gave birth to a wonderful result.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Grid was distracted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have proven your potential by making 10 legendary items.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Now you are growing into a blacksmith comparable to Pagma.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The penalty that occurs when an item’s usage conditions isn’t met has disappeared.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Penalty removal!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style>The greatest disadvantage grabbing onto his ankles since he became Pagma’s Descendant was now gone.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid trembled with excitement.&nbsp;</span><span style>But that joy was brief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your growth has deteriorated due to the blossoming of your potential.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You won’t acquire any additional stats in the future when making items with a unique rating.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This damn thing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had already expected to experience a penalty to some extent.&nbsp;</span><span style>But once the moment came, he couldn’t help feeling bad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I want to increase my stats in the future, I have to produce legendary items...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rate of producing legendary items was the worst.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had been Pagma's Descendant for over a year and he had only been able to produce 11.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid felt desperate and frustrated.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past, he would’ve cursed at the game operators for a few days.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now it was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid quickly overcame the frustration due to the growth in his mentality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘...Not bad.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The deterioration of his stats increase was bad, but the item penalty had also disappeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>What did this suggest?</span></p>
 <p><span style>'In the future, I will truly be dependent on the power of items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the rise of the overgeared legend, which didn’t require potions or skills.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“I will... trade...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The legendary rated Grid’s Greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris verified the details of it and finally accepted the deal.&nbsp;</span><span style>A slave contract.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the future, Chris would have to leave the repairing to Grid, so he could never become Grid’s enemy.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he did something wrong against Grid, his item wouldn’t be repaired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Okay, let’s work well together in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid held out a hand to shake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris looked at his smile and once again wondered if his choice was right.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, he desired Grid’s Greatsword too much.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the best item Chris had seen while reaching level 314.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“P... Please...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris shook his hand without any strength. The look in Grid’s eyes was relaxed as he looked at Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The present Grid was closer to being reborn with the attitude of a legendary, like Braham mentioned.</span></p>
