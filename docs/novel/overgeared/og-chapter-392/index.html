 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘Really long...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had been tied up by the 41st island for five days.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Grid was an ordinary player, he likely would’ve been satisfied and abandoned the 41st island the moment that his new skills were acquired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was normal.&nbsp;</span><span style>What player in this world could repeatedly challenge death?&nbsp;</span><span style>There would only be 1 in every 10,000. The more high level a player was, the more cautious they were.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Grid wasn’t an ordinary person.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was obsessed with overcoming his inadequate talent and was persistent.&nbsp;</span><span style>For Grid, giving up was a concept that should be avoided, and was one of the driving forces behind why he could stand shoulder to shoulder with geniuses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Well, it ended sooner than expected.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t know that the effect of the Motley Flail would resolve it from the beginning. He thought he would have to repeat his death several times.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yet the best outcome occurred in the very first fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘God has a conscience.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was God sorry about always giving Grid bad luck and gave him good luck once in a while?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ssik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smiled as he swapped to Grid’s Greatsword and neared the clone.&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone was in the immortal state.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was cautious of Meditation, so he was thankful for the clone’s actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Linked Kill Wave.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The sword technique was unfolded and eight stormy energy blades flooded towards Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was lost the immortal passive, so the clone needed to gain the advantage in these five seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was what Grid expected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Linked Kill Wave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to the best artificial intelligence, his skill development rate was rather slow.&nbsp;</span><span style>Originally, it was difficult for him to use Linked Wave Kill, but the power of ‘prediction’ was great.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid anticipated that the clone would use Linked Wave Kill and succeeded in unfolding it at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The storm of swords swallowed up each other and a powerful shock wave occurred.&nbsp;</span><span style>The land shook and the sea became chaotic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Noe! Randy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nyaang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A tsunami seemed like it would swallow the island.&nbsp;</span><span style>Noe and Randy flew towards the clone at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Randy used Link while Noe opened his mouth and attempted to steal the stats.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the clone wasn’t easy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blackening, Blacksmith's Rage, and Quick Movements.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The clone used buff skills as an explosion of dark magic occurred around him, shrugging off Noe and Randy and aiming for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The movements were as fast as lightning.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid reeled back as he was stabbed in the heart with Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style>If the tsunami hadn’t covered Grid and the clone at the same time, a combo would’ve succeeded.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid and the clone were swept to the edge of the island by the tsunami. He swapped from Grid’s Boots to Braham’s Boots and used Fly to escape the destruction of the sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok... Heok...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The damp Grid laughed while panting.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, the clone revealed impatience.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was less than two seconds remaining on the immortality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Magic Missile."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He summoned the fake God Hands and fired four Magic Missiles at Grid. At the same time, the clone used Transcended Link.&nbsp;</span><span style>Surprisingly, Grid responded with Revolve.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why would he use Revolve first when it was unconditionally disadvantageous to him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clone was confused and also started to use Revolve.&nbsp;</span><span style>But at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pe-ng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A flash of light struck the clone, who had been paying attention to the approaching strengthened Transcended Link.&nbsp;</span><span style>Where did this attack come from?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was from below.&nbsp;</span><span style>It came from the sea where the clone was standing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Magic Missile flew from it.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment that the tsunami occurred, Grid left one of the God Hands in the sea and waited for this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ack...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clone stumbled. He had a pale complexion and coughed up blood.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an unbelievable situation for the clone.&nbsp;</span><span style>Placing items to take advantage of the terrain and using a skill to draw attention?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was ridiculous that Grid had threatened the clone with such a trick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haven’t I grown? It is all thanks to you. You have helped a lot in developing me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid dealt the killing blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clone screamed with rage as it turned to grey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have won the fight against yourself!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have succeeded in beating the 41st island!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have acquired 1 skill level point from the mission clear reward.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid lost a huge 61.2% experience from the 42nd island.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a result, Grid’s level fell to 305. He would have to hunt for at least 20 days to recover 61.2% of his experience.&nbsp;</span><span style>The time loss was enormous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Grid didn’t think he received any damages.&nbsp;</span><span style>He gained the strongest skills Linked Kill Wave and Pinnacle Kill, as well as rich combat experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Very good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was strength that transcended the concept of level.&nbsp;</span><span style>A noble pride could be seen in Grid’s smile of satisfaction.&nbsp;</span><span style>A notification window popped up in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have overcome your limitations and have taken one step closer to being a legend.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[One of Pagma’s Descendant’s hidden pieces ‘Sealed Ability’ has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The skill ‘Blacksmith’s Eyes’ has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>So far, Grid had acquired three hidden pieces.&nbsp;</span><span style>The first hidden piece gave him a 10% reduction in his skills cooldown time and also the Item Modification skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>He got Item Combination from the second hidden piece, and Minerals Strengthening from the third one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Since then, it’s been a while...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blacksmith’s Eyes?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid felt anticipation as he checked the description of the skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Blacksmith’s Eyes]</span></p>
 <p><span style>You can see some of the abilities and options when looking at the target item. Limited to equipped items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The closer the distance to the target item, the better the analytical power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"In short... It is an item observation skill that applies to items I don’t own.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For example, he could get a glimpse of the armor and weapon that the enemy was using?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was the point of this skill? What was the point of checking items?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid thought for a moment and was belatedly thrilled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok, isn’t this a huge skill?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a huge scam being able to see the details of the enemy’s items.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why?&nbsp;</span><span style>He could block the trump cards hidden in the enemy’s items in advance, and also exploit the weaknesses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuoh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s fists clenched as he shuddered. It was a state where he couldn’t contain his joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I like it when Grid is happy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Me too, nyang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe and Randy laughed and Grid stroked their heads.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sticks smiled as he watched the group of three.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was one fact that Grid overlooked.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s clone had died in the Blackening State.&nbsp;</span><span style>The present Grid never imagined that this variable would provide a fun and positive environment for him.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[Skill Level Point]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Increases the skill level of a specified skill by 100%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Um.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Raise the level of any skill?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be nice to raise the level of powerful fusion skills like Linked Kill Wave, Pinnacle Kill, Transcended Link and Linked Kill. Unfortunately, the fusion skills didn’t have the concept of level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were so powerful that they were already judged as complete skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is better to raise the level of Kill.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, it might not be the case.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid couldn’t decide hastily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It might be good to raise the Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was hard to choose right now.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid decided to save the skill point and not use it hastily.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Sticks approached him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want to move on to the next island?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid nodded without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will do that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was 36 days left until the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>Prior to that, Grid planned to capture all of the Behen Archipelago, so he hastened his steps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have entered the 42nd island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have entered the 43rd island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have entered the...]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The trials to overcome himself seemed to have ended.&nbsp;</span><span style>The 42nd to 49th islands were ordinary missions such as monster hunting and boss raids.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is comfortable.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The monsters inhabiting the islands in the 40’s weren’t weak.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were just very easy compared to when dealing with his clone.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thus, Grid’s momentum continued until he reached the 50th island.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Braham, who had mastered magic while being a direct descendant of Shizo Beriache.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, he was regarded as a legend and was close to the title of the strongest.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then what about now?&nbsp;</span><span style>After losing his body and becoming a soul, he was weak and miserable. The glory of the past couldn’t be found anywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Dammit...! Dammit!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 1st great demon, Baal.&nbsp;</span><span style>That monster’s contractor was one of the few people able to fight with a dragon.&nbsp;</span><span style>They caused trouble for Braham every time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[It can’t happen again this time.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham went looking for his body sealed at the Sword Grave, only to be weakened by Agnus.&nbsp;</span><span style>He felt irritation at his soul losing strength and was eventually reminded of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Pagma’s Descendant will be able to do it.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Pagma had the power of a great demon.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pa-at</span></i><span style>!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham’s soul squeezed out all his remaining magic power and triggered detection magic throughout the continent.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was to find Grid.</span></p>
