 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Transcended Link!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dozens of blue-black energy blades covered the vampires.&nbsp;</span><span style>The vampires cursed as they suffered damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn human!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How ludicrous!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hiik!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>50 vampires rushed over in unison, so Grid had no choice but to run away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hohohohut!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s intimidated!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The vampires enjoyed hunting humans.&nbsp;</span><span style>They herded Grid like a bunny and surrounded him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Flop!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s legs loosed with fear as he saw their sharp fangs and he sank to the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>The trembling and tearful Grid was reminiscent of a frail girl. It was a sad sight that stimulated protective instincts.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the vampires didn’t have any mercy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment that the hungry vampires were going to pounce on Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A black cat fell on a vampire’s head.&nbsp;</span><span style>The vampire screamed as the front paws hit his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuaaaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it? Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was in pain from a cat?&nbsp;</span><span style>The vampires freaked out when they discovered the identity of the cat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Memphis...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe puffed up his plump belly and laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nyahahat! That’s right! This is the best demonic beast of hell! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why is a great demon’s pet cat here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’m not a cat! Kyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Get rid of him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The vampires were also demonkin. However, they were expelled from hell and became hostile towards other demonkin.&nbsp;</span><span style>They no longer aimed for Grid and started attacking Noe, when four white flashes penetrated their chests.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Magic Missile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keook! How can Magic Missile deal so much damage?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The astonished vampires turned their gazes in the direction that the magic came from.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were four golden hands holding greatswords and a dagger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hands that could move on their own and fire magic?&nbsp;</span><span style>The vampires couldn’t understand the golden hands.&nbsp;</span><span style>The golden hands flew towards the confused vampires and wielded their swords.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Chaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The swordsmanship wasn’t great, but it was fast.&nbsp;</span><span style>Moreover, the weapons were so powerful that they couldn’t avoid a deadly blow when hit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kyaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The vampires screamed due to the demonic beast of hell and the unknown hands!&nbsp;</span><span style>It happened when they were feeling extreme confusion and fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Wave.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After the waves of energy, a person appeared wielding a demonic sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>The vampires weren’t able to cope and turned to a grey light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’m still scared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demonic Grid looked at the Grid who was crying on one side. To be precise, it was Randy who copied him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Randy kept crying as she returned to the appearance of a young girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t cry next time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are admirable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should praise me! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Grid, Randy and Noe were having a conversation, the God Hands were struggling with the vampires.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Sword Mastery of ‘God Hand’ has increased to beginner level 6.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Okay.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A grin appeared on Grid’s face as he confirmed the notification window.&nbsp;</span><span style>The mastery level of God Hand grew steadily in proportion to the number of times it was used. It was quite powerful compared to when he fought with Piaro. Indeed, it was encouraging.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the Overgeared members were speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is a scam.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is outrageous.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They met Grid again a week after the Elfin Stone raid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had become an incomparable monster in just a few days.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t just the concept of increased control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Four golden hands, Noe and Randy.&nbsp;</span><span style>They moved in all directions around Grid, so Grid’s hunting rate was unmatched.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid hunted at least 10 vampires in the time it took Pon and Regas to hunt two or three. This was an average figure, and he hunted up to 100 vampires at a time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a combination of being overgeared and his pets. This hunting speed was much faster than the top ranked necromancer.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to that Grid was able to gain four levels in 42 days.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t just due to his speed of hunting. There was the power of the buffs from the Elfin Stone raid and the experience potion from the Reputation Store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>After being defeated by Piaro, Grid was filled with a desire to become stronger and tried his hand at gambling again.&nbsp;</span><span style>The result was that he exhausted all his reputation, but could gain three experience potions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid thought positively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In the first place, the high value products have a limited number of purchases per account.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Assuming that they were purchased only when absolutely necessary, it wasn’t a bad choice to invest his reputation into experience potions.&nbsp;</span><span style>But due to the nature of the drawing, there was a possibility of not giving a single item he wanted if his luck was bad.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Grid reached level 305 and returning from the vampire cities, deciding to stay in Reidan for a while.&nbsp;</span><span style>Irene was going to give birth in less than a month, so he wanted to always stay beside her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He planned to use this time to fulfill his duties as a lord and blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Minerals Strengthening]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Increase the hardness and strength of specified minerals, while lowering the brittleness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hardness meant the hardness of the mineral’s surface, strength meant the degree to which the mineral could withstand force and brittleness was how fragile it was.&nbsp;</span><span style>Generally, hardness and strength were directly proportional to each other, but brittleness tended to increase from impacts.&nbsp;</span><span style>After completing the third class quest, Grid obtained Minerals Strengthening. If he used this skill, he could make the ideal mineral.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It doesn’t seem useful right away.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Minerals Strengthening wasn’t an immediate skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he put 30 grams of a mineral in the strengthening frame, he needed to wait 30 days.&nbsp;</span><span style>An average of 4kg worth of minerals was needed for a one-handed sword, so it didn’t seem that useful. Grid was honestly disappointed at first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But after thinking about it more, he wondered if Minerals Strengthening was the foundation for Minerals Creation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Just like Pagma and Braham created the pavranium, one day I will be able to create my own mineral.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid thought positively about it and placed a small amount of blue orichalcum in the strengthening frame.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to strengthen the pavranium, but that meant having to disassemble one of his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was something Grid wanted to avoid if he was going to quickly raise the rating of the hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span><a id="footnoteref-30" href="#footnote-30">[30]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no time acceleration function.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid pulled out the 30 grams of enhanced blue orichalcum that he had put in the frame before going to the vampire cities. It was certainly a bit harder than the normal blue orichalcum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Um... I have to steadily use this function.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was experimenting in a corner of the smithy with a notification window appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Congratulations! The level of the alchemy facilities in Reidan have risen to intermediate level 4!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Administrator Rabbit ran in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duke Grid! The level of the alchemy facilities finally reached intermediate level 4! If we can keep up this speed of development, it can become an advanced facility in one year and one month!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the alchemy facilities reached an advanced level, they would be able to fully utilize the yellow mithril.&nbsp;</span><span style>After that, they would be able to randomly assign special options to items and the value of the items would skyrocket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Grid’s expression wasn’t good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One year and one month? I invested 30 million, but we still need to wait one year and one month?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"As you know, alchemy is a discipline that is neglected in all kingdoms. The field isn’t systematically developed and it’s hard to find experts, so the development itself is bound to be delayed. The work has been progressing faster than planned thanks to your investment, so I hope that you will wait for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Administrator Rabbit was capable.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the great man who made the ghost city of Reidan turn a profit, so Grid absolutely trusted him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid nodded and had a question after he confirmed the status of the estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But look at this. Why is agricultural our most profitable area? It is ridiculously high compared to the investment amount. Is this all thanks to Piaro?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...That’s right. Sir Piaro’s ability as a farmer is wonderful enough to be written in the history books. It was truly a wise decision when you allowed him to remain a farmer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel, who was with Grid all the time, also agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I think it was a good decision as well. The person who was hoping Piaro would become a sword saint is now appreciating him as a farmer, I never dreamt this day would come. It was a wise and charitable choice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Charitable? Wise?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Bullshit.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no deep meaning behind Grid acknowledging Piaro as a farmer. He just lost.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, he couldn’t bear to tell the truth to his subordinates, so he remained silent.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Shin Youngwoo’s current total account balance was 5,013,009,281 won.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo’s day started by accessing his Internet banking.&nbsp;</span><span style>5 billion won!&nbsp;</span><span style>Every time he checked the account balance, he still couldn’t help thinking this was a dream, causing him to cry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One year ago, I was debt-ridden...! Sob!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why did he get tears every time he checked in the morning?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Blow!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo pulled the tissue away from his nose and prayed again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"God, Buddha, gods of heaven and earth. Please take care of me...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo requested every time despite never making a donation to a church or temple.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wandered into the kitchen and made an espresso with the coffee machine he bought a while ago. He took a sip and handed it to his sister Sehee, who emerged from her room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Drink. This is called a morning coffee.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Can I not drink?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No? Didn’t you want to drink from the beginning?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo earnestly mixed the coffee.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee sat in front of the TV and asked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you coming to my school festival?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the autumn festival held at the Young Ladies High School in three days.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were many pretty girls and the scale was big, so it was a fairly famous festival. Many ordinary people came to visit.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo recalled the text he received from Yerim a few days ago and shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yerim invited me, but I’m not going.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham’s actions might’ve caused him to get millions of anti-fans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He was still afraid to search up his name on the Internet, so he couldn’t go outside. Recently, he had to cover his face with a mask when going jogging.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Maybe someone will be aiming to kidnap me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Usually ordinary people enjoyed themselves when they became rich, but Youngwoo was different. He cherished his body even more.&nbsp;</span><span style>A wide smile appeared on Sehee’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee hummed as she headed towards the bathroom and Grid sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She is ashamed of her brother...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It couldn’t be helped if he was hated by his younger sister. He was now helping his family, but he had been acting pathetically for decades.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo rose from his spot and headed towards the capsule.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would soothe his heart by spending time with his lovely Irene and concentrating on work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, in the empty living room, news was flowing out of the TV about the Young Ladies High School’s festival.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[It’s said that actor Kim Doohyun will participate in the autumn festival of the Young Ladies High School...]</span></p>
