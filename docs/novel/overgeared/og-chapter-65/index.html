 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Until I made the Sword of Self-transcendence, the details of all the items I made were accompanied &nbsp;by the modifier: made by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but lacks experience and reputation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now it had changed to ‘a craftsman with great skills and potential, but his experience and reputation is somewhat lacking.’&nbsp;</span><span style>I felt a little bit recognized.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Anyway, I got a new production hammer, so I was more likely to make rare and epic rated items. In addition, the probability of making normal rated items was relatively low.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was fortunate that I realized the importance of a production hammer and managed to obtain a new one, even if it was delayed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was about to launch my operation to make more money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’ve replaced the hammer so should I now make epic, unique or legendary items?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan interrupted me as I was about to start.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Grid, will you come to my son’s grave with me? Actually, today is the anniversary of my son’s death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I didn’t want to waste time at an unnecessary place when I could be making items to sell.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Khan’s request couldn’t be dismissed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Khan was my only friend in reality and Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘An NPC is my only friend... how depressing...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I decided to postpone my work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>At a small hill north of Winston.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were around 10 graves on the hill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is too small to be a cemetery...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan saw my look and explained.&nbsp;</span><span style>“This is the cemetery where not just my son, but my ancestors are buried.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan stood in front of his son’s gravestone and smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style>Khan missed his son.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"My son... He had excellent qualities as a blacksmith. I had no doubt that he would become a great blacksmith who would surpass me, and maybe even have the same reputation as Albatino. Unfortunately, he died early.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tears filled Khan’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The pain of losing a son is incredibly big. It has been 10 years since he died, but I still miss him and feel regret towards his death. If possible, I would revive him, even if I needed to sacrifice my own life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I didn’t know what to say.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was impossible for me to understand the mind of a parent who lost their child.&nbsp;</span><span style>I stood there with an awkward expression, and the tearful Khan suddenly laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m glad you’re here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Every day, every day... I couldn’t work properly because of nostalgia and despair. But ever since meeting you, I have felt surprised and excited. Didn’t I stop drinking because of you? Now, please say hello to my son.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan stood straight in front of his son’s gravestone. Then he spoke towards the gravestone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Son, this is Pagma’s Descendant, who I told you about every night. Isn’t it great to meet him? Are you surprised? Isn’t it great? Are you wondering why such a person is with your father?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Khan...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan started crying again. He finally sank to his knees, hugging the gravestone while exclaiming.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Don't worry! Don’t worry! Your father is doing well, so don’t worry! This great person is taking care of your father! He promised to take care of the smithy! So relax and don’t worry. Rest in peace... Sob...sob sob.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countless NPCs existed in Satisfy. Every one of them were alive with stories and feelings like this.&nbsp;</span><span style>Amazing. I truly admired Satisfy’s technology.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"... Damn, they should do it moderately.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My vision was cloudy from the dust in my eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>I moved my gaze to the sky due to a lump in my throat. Then I promised.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Your father is my most precious friend. I will treat him well. I’ll also make the smithy the best. So... as you father said, rest in peace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then a notification window popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The bond between you and Khan has deepened.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The souls of Khan’s ancestors are thrilled by your emotions towards Khan and emerge from underground.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>10 blue lights in the shape of people appeared in front of me.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then they spoke simultaneously towards me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is good to meet you, Pagma’s Descendant. Friend of our descendant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-Wait...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weren’t these souls ghosts?</span></p>
 <p><span style>I hurriedly called out to Khan,&nbsp;</span><span style>“K-Khan. Khan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Drrrong! Drrrong!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Did you go crazy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan was sleeping while hugging his son’s gravestone. No, how could he fall asleep in such a short amount of time?&nbsp;</span><span style>I realized that I was the only one facing these ghosts, and formed tight fists.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“C-Come on! You evil ghosts! I will survive to the end of the horror movie!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>...Yes, to be honest, I was a little frightened of ghosts. No, to be honest, I really hated ghosts.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because I had actually encountered a ghost during my elementary school days.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, I might’ve been seeing things, now that I thought about it... Anyway, the intense fear of that time was still deeply engraved in my mind, causing a ghost allergy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blue souls floating in the air were confused when I told them to fight, and they didn’t say anything.&nbsp;</span><span style>I didn’t feel any hostility from them, so I asked carefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You... are you really ghosts...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You could say that."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The answer made me feel despair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unbelievable! No way! How can ghosts exist in this world? I might’ve seen it when I was a child, but it wasn’t really a ghost!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ghosts laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha, what doesn’t exist in this world? Yet you think it’s strange that there are ghosts?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I belatedly realized.&nbsp;</span><span style>I forgot for a while, but this was Satisfy, not reality. It was an artificial world created by human hands!&nbsp;</span><span style>Not just ghosts, but living bones, talking beasts and even fire beasts existed. People could fly and shoot magic.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yes, it wasn’t strange for ghosts to exist in this world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I asked them.&nbsp;</span><span style>“S-So what? Why did you emerge?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They answered.&nbsp;</span><span style>"We are thrilled that you showed a true heart to our descendants, so we have come to give you a reward.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"... Reward?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was it money?&nbsp;</span><span style>As I was feeling expectant, the biggest one came forward and introduced himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I am the person who witnessed Pagma’s swordsmanship 130 years ago.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagma’s swordsmanship!&nbsp;</span><span style>I discovered a clue to the class quest, which had been delayed because I didn’t know how to proceed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"130 years ago... I witnessed the beauty of Pagma’s swordsmanship that pierced the sky, and was so fascinated that I ran to Kesan Canyon. Then I drew a picture of Pagma’s swordsmanship, which was clearly imprinted in my mind, on a north cliff of the canyon. I was so excited that I wouldn’t be able to fall asleep if I didn’t do that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I obtained a clue for Pagma’s swordsmanship, which I had no idea how to find or learn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The painting will probably help you learn Pagma’s swordsmanship.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The quest ‘Pagma’s Descendant’ has been updated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Pagma’s Descendant]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Difficulty: Class quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You have certainly been given Pagma’s blacksmith skills.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But do you know exactly who Pagma is? Can you proudly carry out his will?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who is Pagma? If he was simply a blacksmith with good skills, his legends wouldn’t be scattered across the continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First, start with the clue of the swordsmanship that pierced the sky, and follow Pagma’s legend. If you can collect all of the legends, you will truly understand Pagma and succeed his will.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a new legend will be born.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is no time limit for this class quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* If you accept the class quest of a legendary class, you can’t change your class again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The legendary class quest has the power to transform Satisfy’s world, according to the results.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Class Quest Clear Conditions: Complete all linked quests successfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Class Quest Clear Reward: Unknown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* First Class Quest: [Pagma’s Swordsmanship.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person who witnessed Pagma’s swordsmanship 130 years ago has showed up and given you a clue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If you head to Kesan Canyon that is to the south of Winston, you will find a clue to Pagma’s swordsmanship carved on a northern cliff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* First Class Quest Clear Condition: Learn Pagma’s swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First Class Quest Clear Reward: Dainsleif (Reproduction).&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>After confirming the newly emerged quest information window, the souls said farewell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Pagma’s Descendant is a friend of our descendant. We pray that you will become greater than Pagma. Now, we should be returning to where we were.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The souls disappeared one by one in front of me.&nbsp;</span><span style>One soul remained until the end and spoke softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you for looking after my father.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suuuuoh...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>We came to this place at dusk and it was now night.&nbsp;</span><span style>The remnants of the souls disappearing scattered a blue light like falling stars, and then Khan woke up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Umm...? Did I fall asleep? Is it already night?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Old Man, you have a habit of sleeping everywhere, but it isn’t good for your health.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hmm... I was never like this... Huh? Heok! Y-You! Why is the part around your crotch damp?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Be quiet.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>40 days had passed since Huroi cleared the ‘Wait’ quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, he accepted the S.A. Group’s proposal to thoroughly check his health in the hospital, then spent another week answering S.A Group’s questions and agreed to let them announce his identity as the first second class in Satisfy. Then he spent the next 23 days riding a horse around Mongolia in order to satisfy his nomadic nature. Finally, he returned to Satisfy three days ago and improved his understanding of the newly acquired second class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And today!&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi arrived at Khan’s smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was to meet Grid, whom he had sworn to serve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Will he be pleased to see me? Or will he ask why I only came now?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi was incredibly tense. He couldn’t help gulping.&nbsp;</span><span style>As he hesitantly stood in front of the smithy, the door opened from the inside. Grid exited from the open door.&nbsp;</span><span style>Did he noticed that Huroi was here and came out to meet him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“M-My Liege!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thrilled Huroi shouted.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid didn’t even look at him.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t think that the title of ‘liege’ applied to him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi shouted again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid finally turned towards Huroi.&nbsp;</span><span style>The two people made eye contact.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi ran forward and bent to one knee in front of Grid, like a knight before a monarch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you been well in the meantime? I’m sorry for not making any contact with you until now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Huroi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, My Liege. I am Huroi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the dungeon, Huroi had sacrificed himself to allow Grid to escape the four knights.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi knew that Grid would be worried.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid glared and abruptly grabbed Huroi’s neck. Then he let out a stream of curses at Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey, you son of a bitch! You, I know you? I don’t! I don’t know why the knights associated you with me, but I was disqualified from the item making game and forced to accept a ridiculous quest! Huh? I was trapped in solitary confinement with my mouth gagged, then I had to fight someone called the Northern Nova. Can you imagine how much I suffered?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi was at a loss for words.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s attitude was completely different from what he imagined.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t understand why Grid was angry, but he sincerely apologized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry. I was wrong! My Liege!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His master was his sky! His master was angry due to the actions of his subordinates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid became rather confused at Huroi’s apology.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This guy, he seemed perfectly fine and smart when I first met him. He seems to have become a complete freak since being stuck in prison. Was he severely tortured?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyway, he didn’t want to be with this disgusting guy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid let go of Huroi and waved his hand.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Hey, hey, that’s it. I understand already, so you should leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi was baffled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Go where?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go wherever.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My path is with My Liege!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi had already vowed to follow Grid. The descendants of the Blue Wolf didn’t forsake their oaths. He would follow Grid for the rest of his life.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to his second class, ‘Apostle of Justice’s Partner,’ he practically needed to stay at Grid’s side because all his stats increased by 20% when he was with the Apostle of Justice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T-This crazy...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi didn’t notice Grid’s irritation as he asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"My Liege, are you part of a guild? If you have a guild then please let me join. Isn’t it better for me to be in the same guild as you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guild? I don’t have one. So please leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh! Good! Are you planning to make your own guild? If My Liege makes a guild, many people will follow you. I will assist you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prior to going to Kesan Canyon, Grid was going to get minerals to make armor for his own use.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid wanted to leave quickly instead of listening to Huroi’s delirious chatter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey, stop talking nonsense and move out of the way. Yes? I’m going.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Grid left towards his destination.&nbsp;</span><span style>Well, it seemed like Grid disliked him, so Huroi was forced to follow Grid secretly.&nbsp;</span><span style>Obstacles appeared on a flat road. As soon as he created a fire to cook meat, a sudden shower poured down from a clear sky, meeting bandits at places famous for being peaceful, etc.&nbsp;</span><span style>While watching, Huroi realized that Grid was a person of bad luck. If Grid fell asleep, he was sure to break his nose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi felt a burning sense of duty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I must protect him!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Apostle of Justice’s Partner needed to be with the Apostle of Justice.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi didn’t doubt it.</span></p>
