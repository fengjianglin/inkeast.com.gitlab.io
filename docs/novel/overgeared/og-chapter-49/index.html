 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Grid and Euphemina hurriedly ran away from the knights.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to Euphemina grasping the layout of the first and second floors of the dungeon, the two people didn’t have to wander and managed to reach the surface level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Brilliant sunshine! Blue sky! A green lawn!&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was excited by the bright and brilliant landscape that was unlike the dark dungeon where all sides were blocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahahahat! We escaped the castle~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dungeon entrance that Grid and Euphemina escaped from was located between towers erected on the east-facing wall.&nbsp;</span><span style>The two of them were exiting the tower, and there was a lookout above them.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, there were concerns that the guards in the watchtowers would hear Grid’s loud voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be quiet, we are still in the middle of enemy territory.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina tried to calm Grid down but he was so excited about escaping that he didn’t hear her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kya! Look at this clean air. The humid air in the dungeon was so bad! I thought my lungs were rotting away. Air is important! I finally understand why city people are so excited about the air in the countryside!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid made a fuss as he lay down on the lawn and rolled around. He was out of control.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina had a headache.&nbsp;</span><span style>Most of the soldiers were defeated but the power of the lord’s bodyguards still seemed intact.&nbsp;</span><span style>The bodyguards weren’t a match for knights, but their level and skills exceeded that of ordinary soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style>Euphemina didn’t want to face them. In the worst case, they could tie up her feet until the knights arrived from underground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey Grid, we need to leave this place as secretly and quietly as possible, so be a bit more quiet...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hah~~ the smell of the grass is so clear and refreshing! The nice scent of pine needles!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina tiredly rubbed her temple, steadily reaching the limits of her patience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Euphemina took action and approached Grid, who was sniffing the lawn, and grabbed his collar.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then she pushed her mouth towards Grid’s ears and yelled,</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You! &nbsp;Didn’t I tell you to be quiet? Don’t you have a brain? We are in the middle of enemy territory! We should be running away from this dangerous territory, so why are you making noise while rolling around!!! Yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aaaagh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid felt like his eardrums had ruptured from the shock.&nbsp;</span><span style>The tearful Grid struggled to escape from Euphemina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You, don’t embarrass me anymore but acting like a fool. Don’t you want to leave this damn place? So do it properly. If you act so stupidly again, I really will kill you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina knew that the grade of Grid’s class was higher than hers. Grid wasn’t a weak person.&nbsp;</span><span style>Nevertheless, she couldn’t help becoming angry as she kept scrutinizing Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was really afraid that he would be killed by Euphemina when he suddenly turned his attention to one side.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he gently spoke to Euphemina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There... are they enemies?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An ominous feeling.&nbsp;</span><span style>Euphemina slowly turned in the direction that Grid pointed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then she was frustrated.&nbsp;</span><span style>16 bodyguards armed with full plate armor appeared in a systematic formation.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaeeeeeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Their 16 swords reflected in the sunlight, causing flashes throughout the castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid scowled and snapped at her.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Look what this angry girl did... You caused such a big fuss that the enemies emerged.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina was upset and retorted,&nbsp;</span><span style>"This is because you were loud first!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina’s killing intent flared up.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid trembled with fear as he apologized,&nbsp;</span><span style>“S-Sorry, I was wrong. It was a slip of the tongue.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina’s head throbbed as she thought,</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This man, what type of concept is he trying on? Why does he keep acting afraid of me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was the one who defeated the Northern Nova in a one-on-one match. He also overwhelmed four knights with just his presence.&nbsp;</span><span style>She didn’t have direct knowledge of his skills, but she could make a guess. Grid was strong. A type of man who wouldn’t be afraid of anything in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, Euphemina started trembling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This guy is playing with me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina disliked Grid from the beginning.&nbsp;</span><span style>When the two people first met at the item production game, Grid wasn’t misled by Euphemina’s beautiful appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>That fact alone was humiliating for Euphemina, then she heard all the ridiculing words Grid had spoken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kid, fox, etc!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now he was blaming her for doing nothing wrong? This man!&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an embarrassing memory that Euphemina wanted to forget for the rest of her life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a middle-aged man dressed in silver and gold appeared from among the bodyguards.&nbsp;</span><span style>His identity was Baron Lowe.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the lord of Winston, the one who allied with the Mero Company and allowed the residents of Winston to suffer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"To have reached here... did you get rid of all the soldiers and knights? Ha...hahaha! I can’t believe it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baron Lowe laughed like he was insane.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was impossible to maintain his sanity after losing most of his army from one intruder and one prison escapee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...The people can’t be controlled without the army. Now I have no way of stopping people from going to Earl Steim. Thus, Earl Steim will find out about my actions and my life is ruined.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baron Lowe was extremely angry after realizing his fate. He couldn’t forgive Grid and Euphemina, who took everything away from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Catch them! Tear apart all their limbs and make it so that they can’t close their eyes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 16 bodyguards followed what was possibly the lord’s last command and got into formation.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was a formation that could even compete with a knight.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it was no use in front of Euphemina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Demon King’s Tail Fire.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ack?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bodyguards groaned at the same time. It was because their armor started to heat up.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the amazing sight unfolded.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hwaruruk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Blue flames soared from the bodies of the bodyguards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aaaagh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-What is this...? Kuack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The terrible screams and painful struggle only lasted a short time.&nbsp;</span><span style>It didn’t take long for the bodyguards to be turned to ashes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T-This is ridiculous...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A magic that annihilated 16 of the bodyguards.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid and Baron Lowe couldn’t believe it, despite witnessing the scene with their own two eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>As their faces paled with horror, Euphemina gave a refreshing smile.&nbsp;</span><span style>By taking care of the bodyguards, she had managed to relieve some of the stress that reached the limit due to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Indeed, the lord’s guards are very strong. Their experience is pretty good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid and Baron Lowe felt a similar sentiment as they looked at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I need to avoid this evil girl...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Demon. She is a demon.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, Baron Lowe was captured by Euphemina.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was tied up and dragged away like a dog caught by a dog catcher.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid vowed yet again.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘I must never touch this woman again. I won’t be able to survive if I do.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maybe Huroi had managed to tie up their feet for a while since the pursuit of the knights still couldn’t be felt.&nbsp;</span><span style>Euphemina hurried and they managed to safely escape the castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then they met an unexpected person outside the castle.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the second highest ranked person in the Mero Company, Rabbit.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was standing with 10 people as if he had been waiting for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Colour returned to the face of the lord.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Ohh! Aren’t you Rabbit? You heard the news and came to rescue me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid became tense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This... are they soldiers from the Mero Company?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Grid inwardly shouted, Euphemina strode forward towards Rabbit. She looked at Rabbit’s subordinates and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"These are the people you mentioned earlier?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit nodded.&nbsp;</span><span style>“That’s correct. They originally followed Valmont but became disappointed with his brutality. They won’t hold you back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They do look strong. Great. I can count on them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two people were talking like they were friends!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid felt extreme anxiety.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘Why are the two of them so close? Wait, wasn’t Euphemina hired by the Mero Company in the first place? Then why? Maybe Euphemina saving me was a trap!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s guess was this:</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <ol>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style> Winston’s lord and the Mero Company had joined hands.&nbsp;</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style> Euphemina, who was hired by the Mero Company, was subsequently the lord’s ally.</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style> The conclusion that could be drawn from the first and second fact was that Euphemina was an enemy.</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ol>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>If Euphemina really belonged to the lord, she wouldn’t have killed his soldiers. She also wouldn’t be dragging the lord around like a dog.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the first place, why would Euphemina rescue Grid if she was the enemy?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>She also returned the unique dagger to him instead of selling it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Grid was so confused that any thinking was impossible.&nbsp;</span><span style>He could only make the simple judgment that Euphemina was the enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is the end... I really can’t easily trust a black-bellied animal like her! I showed her some goodwill, only to be duped!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid thought of some of the historical dramas he watched and decided.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I won’t obediently let her kill me. I wanted to be more careful about my stat distribution, but it can’t be helped. Status window.’</span></p>
