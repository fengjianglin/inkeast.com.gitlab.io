 <p></p>
 <p><span style> ‘I just need to obtain the materials if I don’t have them.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s eyes were filled with greed as he dismantled Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Shouldn’t I get some profit?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had saved Isabel by sacrificing the Goddess' Essence.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to receive a little something in return.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will melt Lifael’s Spear.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he could obtain some adamantium.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a unique opportunity to obtain a god mineral for free.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It will be okay if I can take off a small portion of the spear.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>(Understanding of Gods’ Weapons) Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill was level 6 and ‘greedy eyes’ was mastered. According to the result of his analysis, Lifael’s Spear was longer and thicker than necessary.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was somewhat unsuitable for women to use.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It will turn out nicely for Isabel if I reduce the length and thickness of the spear.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid justified it to himself as he threw the spear into the furnace.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was no hesitation.&nbsp;</span><span style>The essence of Grid’s nature was greed.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was fueled by his desire as a blacksmith to make an item of a higher level as soon as possible.&nbsp;</span><span style>The present Grid was the embodiment of desire. No one could control him. Even the person involved couldn’t suppress himself. He was like a drug addict in front of drugs.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s hands were much faster and sophisticated than before.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was thanks to the increase in skill level of his production skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lifael’s Spear became shorter and thinner under his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blacksmiths in the smithy were at a loss for words.&nbsp;</span><span style>They looked at Grid’s skills and wondered if this was a blacksmith of the gods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s finished!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After three hours of struggle, Grid reconstructed Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style>His face distorted.&nbsp;</span><span style>The result was terrible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Incomplete Lifael’s Spear has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Incomplete Lifael’s Spear]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The harmony designed by god is broken. This is a useless stick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...It’s like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Had he experienced this only one or twice?&nbsp;</span><span style>Satisfy was thoroughly designed not to give any easy benefits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sigh.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The frustrated Grid started to restore Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Unfortunately, it couldn’t be helped. He didn’t know what Goddess Rebecca would do if he gave Isabel an incomplete spear.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttiring~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, he invested another three hours into restoring Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then there was a cheerful sound effect and an unbelievable message window popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The result was terrible, but your vision and spirit to challenge reinterpreting a god’s weapon is deserving of high praise. You are qualified to become a true legend.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[One of Pagma’s Descendant’s hidden pieces ‘Sealed Ability’ has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The skill ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Reconstruction’ has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Legendary Blacksmith’s Reconstruction Lv. 1]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reinterpret items with a 100% understanding into a new form.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The performance of the modified item will depend on your interpretation, skill and intentions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* An item can only be reconstructed once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* When the skill level increases, the number of reconstructions will increase by one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have taken one step closer to becoming a true legend by opening the hidden piece ‘Sealed Ability.’ Skill cooldown time will be reduced by 10%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Reputation throughout the continent will rise by +2.000.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You currently have 30,011 reputation throughout the continent. You can now use the Reputation Store.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...The old saying isn’t wrong.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid clenched his fists before he burst out laughing.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Nice people live well! Kuhahahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid benefited greatly from returning Lifael’s Spear to its original shape, and saw himself as a good person.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>His original malicious intent of trying to obtain adamantium was erased from his memories.&nbsp;</span><span style>The brain resembled its owner and was selfish.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>OGC was the world’s first gaming specialty channel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Decades before the emergence of virtual reality games, it held various game content and established the e-sports culture.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Satisfy dominated the games market and OGC reigned as one of the world’s top gaming stations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let’s do a live broadcast of the pope candidates’ speeches.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The director of OGC.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was a former PD who rose to an executive status, and had many accomplishments. It was enough to give him the nickname of ‘Guaranteed Viewership.’&nbsp;</span><span style>But the members of his planning team raised concerns.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How many people will be interested in who the pope of the Rebecca Church is? No one will be interested apart from the users who are part of the Rebecca Church.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Speech events are just static. The ratings will hit the floor and it won’t be easy to obtain advertisements.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wouldn’t it be better to air the PvP tournament that is taking place in the Zik Principality at that time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We can record it, but why does it have to be a live broadcast? It’s the prime time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It isn’t worth recording. It is better to cover it briefly in the news...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The director watched his rebellious team and clapped. Once he confirmed that their attention was on him, he made a shocking remark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was informed that a user is a pope candidate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-Is this true?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Last year, the Rebecca Church had around 71 million members.&nbsp;</span><span style>But this year, the number of members had crossed 80 million. It was estimated that it would cross 90 million by the end of this year.&nbsp;</span><span style>It truly was Satisfy’s first religion, as the growth rate was unbelievable. It was difficult to gauge how big it would grow in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then what if the master of this religion was a user?&nbsp;</span><span style>This was a rare scoop.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a scoop comparable to the events that Grid was involved in.&nbsp;</span><span style>The motivation of the planning team started to burn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A live broadcast is good! Start promoting it right now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will seek sponsors.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will obtain advertisements!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoa, whoa.”&nbsp;</span><span style>The director calmed his excited team members.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Do you want to create rumors? I don’t want to share this expensive information with other broadcasters. Our goal is to have the exclusive live coverage. This information should only be disclosed once it has started.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As SNS evolved, the people’s speed of information sharing was fast enough to exceed common sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This pope candidates speech event. At the start, the ratings might by less than 0.1%, but it will reach at least 15%. The prices of the ads we insert in the middle will be a new record. Now, go and prepare.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ku~ we will be busy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the time, the director didn’t know this.&nbsp;</span><span style>OGC would secure the highest audience rating since its creation.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Chirita.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal’s father was a mere viscount 10 years ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>The political circles of the empire didn’t pay attention to him.&nbsp;</span><span style>But 10 years ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>His position suddenly changed after his son Pascal became the head of the Judar Church.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the father of the leader of a church with 20 million members, so he played a major role in politics and he earned the title of earl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And now...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hup~! The air of the Vatican is very clear!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Chirita received the favor of Emperor Juander. It meant he became one of the best powers in the empire.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was natural, since his son would soon be pope.&nbsp;</span><span style>The earl’s body was covered with various luxuries, so he really stood out.&nbsp;</span><span style>The various nobles who came to listen to the speeches of the pope candidates gathered around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Earl Chirita, it’s an honor to meet you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"In a month, you will be the father of His Holiness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Won’t you be awarded the title of duke at that time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The earl was excited at the behavior of the nobles from other nations.&nbsp;</span><span style>His life had changed like this thanks to having a good son.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal approached him at this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Welcome, Earl Chirita.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh, Sir Pascal. It has been a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal was married to the church.&nbsp;</span><span style>Since he had an official position, he had to treat his father like everyone else.&nbsp;</span><span style>The two people excused themselves and moved to a secret place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Did you receive support from the emperor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Um, yes. He sent five Black Knights and one Red Knight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal’s face twisted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Only one Red Knight...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Red Knights were called the strongest group on the continent.&nbsp;</span><span style>But not long ago, didn’t Grid take down Kamiyan with one blow?&nbsp;</span><span style>He was skeptical about sending only one Red Knight as support.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is the number of the knight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The 19th knight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal’s eyes widened with surprise.&nbsp;</span><span style>The disappointment and anxiety on his face disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A knight in the 10’s was sent!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The number attached to the knight was a measure of strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>The 30th knight was called a 100 man army, while the 20th knight was called a 1,000 man army.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The 10th knight? They were at a level that could cope with five people with the strength of the 20th knight alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>The 19th knight was dozens of times stronger than the 30th knight, Kamiyan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The emperor truly cares about me!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal trembled with excitement when Earl Chirita asked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But why did you ask for support?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A fly is bothering me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal had seen Grid as a disaster just a while ago. But not anymore. Now that the 19th knight came, Grid was just a fly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘My hair loss will soon disappear.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal’s forehead had become exposed in just a few days, but now he had a wide smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“There will be a fuss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Vatican was fully crowded.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid frowned as he watched the surging crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘OGC Station?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Broadcast cameras were installed throughout the Vatican. Choi Hyeyoung, an OGC announcer was rehearsing in front of the fountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It will be annoying.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The public’s interest in the pope election seemed to be much higher than expected.&nbsp;</span><span style>If they saw him here, he would be flooded with interview requests.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to avoid this, Grid wore the Slaughterer’s mask and eye patch. His face and ID were hidden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s easier these days.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian and Huroi approached the relieved Grid. Isabel was with them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Grid handed Lifael’s Spear to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"White Transformation was sealed. It won’t eat at your health anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Thank you... Thank you very much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel was thrilled to tears. Thanks to Grid, she was saved from a hellish life and she liked Grid more than before. To her, Grid and Damian were bright lights from Goddess Rebecca.&nbsp;</span><span style>Meanwhile, Huroi was sighing with relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I was worried that My Lord would try to take some of the materials and receive a divine punishment...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, it seemed like he didn’t do anything to the divine weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Not becoming greedy when seeing such a great item... My Lord has grown further. It’s really commendable.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi gave Grid a thumbs up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why is he doing that?’&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was bewildered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, there were eyes closely watching him.</span></p>
