 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>A vast body of water.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a flash of light over the endless sea and a man appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>As Braham’s soul occupied his body and immediately teleported to this place, he opened up the status window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Braham Eshwald (Grid)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Class: Great Magician</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: Possessor of Great Knowledge</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The best intellectual of this time. The truth hasn’t been learned yet, so he is still obstinate. This pursuit of knowledge is very strong, sometimes acting as a poison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Intelligence will rise by 35%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a low probability of running wild.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: One who Became a Legend</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Abnormal conditions don’t work well on you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* You won’t die when health is at the minimum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Easily acknowledged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: ???</span></p>
 <p><span style>* ???</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level: 545</span></p>
 <p><span style>Health: 858,310/858,310 (Correction)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mana: 13,964,000/13,965,000 (Correction)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strength: 258 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 3,400</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agility: 1,009 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligence: 15,880</span></p>
 <p><span style>* In this human flesh, Braham Eshwald’s full strength can’t be drawn out. Most of his stats are sealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every level up gave 10 stat points.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, it meant that the sum total of Braham’s stats at level 545 exceeded 20,000, which was beyond common sense.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, there were many ways to raise stats apart from levelling up, but even considering this, Braham’s stats were too unrealistic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s total stats exceeded 14,000, but that was because he had a large variety of stats.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid only had around 6,000 points in his combat related stats.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was ridiculously high, but it just seemed shabby in front of Braham.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It even says that Braham’s stats are sealed. What was his original strength?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Considering his health and mana, Braham’s strength and stamina should be at least 10 times higher than it was now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Rather...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In this human flesh, Braham Eshwald’s full strength can’t be drawn out.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This phrase really bothered him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You, are you not a human?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[My appearance is no different from humans, and I have a finite life.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘...Does that mean he’s human?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Humans were humans. No.&nbsp;</span><span style>If that was the case, answer simply instead of making it so complicated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"So, where is this place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was difficult to distinguish the sea from the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was confused about whether his feet were in the sky or sea right now, or if he was standing upright or upside down.&nbsp;</span><span style>Braham laughed at him, who was struggling before the overwhelming majesty of nature.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A legend feels awe at something like this?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isn’t it natural for humans to feel smaller in front of nature?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A legend is transcendent. You shouldn’t think of yourself as a simple person. It is no different from making a wall around yourself.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is plausible.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, Grid was suspicious of Braham.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pagma was recorded as dying 100 years ago. On the other hand, Braham said that Pagma died 300 years ago, making him a liar and suspicious.&nbsp;</span><span style>But was it because Braham’s soul was now inside him?&nbsp;</span><span style>His suspicions and wariness towards Braham faded and he started to sympathize with the words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You should only beware those who can threaten you, and feel contempt towards the rest. That is the attitude of a legend.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then do you fear caution as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid sounded him out.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s mouth smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Braham’s smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[I am beyond the boundaries of fear.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Ah, I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was like this when they met a year and a half ago. Braham had high pride.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was already dead, but what would he have been like when alive?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"In any case, where is this place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid asked Braham again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Red Sea]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Red Sea.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the largest sea that separated the East Continent and West Continent.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past thousands of years, both continents had poured a myriad of resources into crossing the sea, but they failed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only a few people succeeded in intercontinental movement.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the process, tens of thousands of victims were said to have shed blood here, turning the sea red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This is the center of the world. It is a source of infinite mana. That is where the worst creatures can exist deep in the sea.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You don’t have to explain every trivial detail.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Okay, I will get to the point. I can obtain something from here.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuooooong.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately after Braham’s meaningful remark, big waves occurred on the surface of the sea.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A tsunami occurred in a short amount of time. A thunderstorm occurred in the darkened sky, causing a shiver to go down Grid’s spine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this all of a sudden... Heok?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The grumbling Grid suddenly realized it.&nbsp;</span><span style>The source of irritation that stirred the endless sky and sea.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Braham.&nbsp;</span><span style>The notification windows proved this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Braham has used Spell Drain.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[There is no target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The target isn’t limited.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Magic power has been stolen from the atmosphere.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Magic power has been stolen from the sea.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Magic power has been stolen from the sun.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your magic power has temporarily increased.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your magic power has temporarily increased.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your magic power has temporarily...]</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is ridiculous!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Spell Drain.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a magic that could steal a certain amount of magic power from the targeted user, monster, or NPC.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a basic spell that any magician could learn, and the effects were insignificant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham’s Spell Drain was showing a power that was beyond common sense.&nbsp;</span><span style>By designating the target as all of nature, the amplification rate of the magic power was unthinkable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This is enough.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham stopped Spell Drain when his magic power was several times higher than before and used Teleport.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s body disappeared again with the light.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The location of the Yatan Church’s main temple changed from time to time.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were many hostile forces, so they had to keep the location a secret.&nbsp;</span><span style>Since Satisfy opened, there wasn’t a single user who knew the location of the temple.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even the black magicians who were members of the church didn’t know the location of the main temple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But today.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I finally found it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 1st ranked explorer, Skunk’s party succeeded in finding the Yatan Church’s main temple.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was truly a historic achievement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isn’t it small and unimpressive? I thought it would be a nice place like the Rebecca Church’s Vatican.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The Vatican is unnecessarily big."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eighth Canyon.&nbsp;</span><span style>The steep walls were in the shape of the number eight, and the temple was located on the outskirts of the canyon.&nbsp;</span><span style>At first glance, it was like a shabby temple in a rural village.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the three pillars placed at the entrance of the temple looked exactly like those described in the book.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Contact every guild and church. Sell this information at an expensive price.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Yatan Church had committed a lot of evils.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were many users with quests to subjugate the Yatan Church.&nbsp;</span><span style>Skunk’s party could become rich if they traded the information.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hao is offering 1.5 million gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That dog.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Giant Guild is offering 1.8 million gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is still lacking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The Violet Guild is offering 2.35 million gold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Violet? Oh, the first paladin of the Dominion Church.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian of the Rebecca Church, Toban of the Judar Church, and Violet of the Dominion Church.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were often called the three main paladins.&nbsp;</span><span style>Among them, Violet’s ranking was the lowest. However, it was rumored that her combat ability was the best.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the first place, it was natural that the Dominion Church’s paladins would be more specialized in battle than the paladins of other religions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“2.53 million gold... It’s a little less than I expected.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skunk made an ambiguous expression while his companions tried to persuade him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It has already been one year and eight months since the massive war between the allies and the Yatan Church started. But there are fewer people obsessed with the Yatan Church’s quest than I thought.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The Dominion Church is a religion that admires war.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t think anyone will offer more than Violet. Make the deal with Violet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skunk nodded. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hmm, okay. Instead, I have a condition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What condition?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"She should come with reporters from at least 15 countries.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skunk’s party had found the Yatan Church’s main temple!&nbsp;</span><span style>Skunk was planning to increase the value of himself and his party by spreading this great news all over the world.&nbsp;</span><span style>The party members nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then three days later.&nbsp;</span><span style>Skunk’s party met up with Violet.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dozens of reporters filmed their meeting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The publicity is excellent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skunk shrugged at Violet, who handed over the advance with a cynical smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don’t you want to spread the word that you are the one who shattered the Yatan Church’s main temple? Take them to the Yatan Temple and have then film you in action.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Our guild operates an internet broadcasting station. It is more profitable to spread the quest’s progress through the guild’s station rather than sell it to other broadcasters.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, is that so? Then the reporters should go home alone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Violet paid the reporters for their work. Then she followed Skunk’s guidance and headed towards the main temple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chase after them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reporters weren’t going to miss this scoop.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unlike their promise to Violet, they secretly followed her group instead of leaving.&nbsp;</span><span style>The next day.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Violet Guild were able to reach the Yatan Church’s main temple, hidden in Eight Canyon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the place....”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gulp.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Violet’s party members couldn’t hide their tension as they stood in front of the main temple.&nbsp;</span><span style>Tallos, the Yatan Church’s First Servant, was at the main temple.&nbsp;</span><span style>Could they really succeed in raiding him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were over 90 of them and their preparations were complete, but the information about Tallos was lacking.&nbsp;</span><span style>They only heard rumors that he was the strongest black magician.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Violet encouraged her uneasy troops.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The class combination of our group is ideal, and there are four people who have third advancement classes. Our strength is enough to kill the First Servant, and then we will shatter the main temple of the Yatan Church.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a reason for Violet’s confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Kill the First Servant of Yatan (SS+)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been one year and eight months since she received this quest.&nbsp;</span><span style>Violet was only a first advancement paladin who hadn’t reached level 200 yet when she got it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now she was a third advancement paladin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Couldn’t she defeat Tallos, who was a named grade boss that she received at the time of the second advancement?&nbsp;</span><span style>Tallos’ level was likely to be lower than everyone expected.&nbsp;</span><span style>Violet made this positive analysis and her group entered the main temple, with the reporters following closely behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then after a while.&nbsp;</span><span style>Violet’s group fell into misery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Look at these trivial things.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yatan’s First Servant, Tallos.&nbsp;</span><span style>His strength was beyond belief.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a fourth advancement black magician, he overwhelmed Violet’s group alone. Even his subordinates were third advancement black magicians.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Violet’s face distorted as she fell victim to a curse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is crazy...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She would miserably fail the quest that she had for one year and eight months!&nbsp;</span><span style>Violet thought it was unfair.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her stomach cramped because she paid 2.35 million gold to Skunk and 300,000 gold on the preparations.&nbsp;</span><span style>She wanted to split apart the head of the alliance general who gave her this difficult quest at level 200.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the reporters were busy capturing this scene. They forgot about acting secretly so that they wouldn’t be seen by Violet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Amazing!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A huge scoop!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yatan’s First Servant that was wrapped in a veil of mystery, Tallos!&nbsp;</span><span style>He was more than expected.&nbsp;</span><span style>The audience ratings would be huge the moment they showed the large scale group that included four third advancement users being overwhelmed.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reporters could get this year’s press award and special bonuses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment that Violet’s group was feeling desperate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Magic Missile."</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a basic spell that level 10 magicians who just started the game could learn.&nbsp;</span><span style>The weak spell pierced through the temple and struck Tallos’ chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuaaaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was wrong with him?&nbsp;</span><span style>Tallos, who hadn’t flinched despite being hit by the third advancement users, was screaming with pain.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was natural for all eyes to move in the direction that Magic Missile came from.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A fake. Hey, where is Amoract’s soul hiding?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white haired man speaking in a haughty manner to Tallos.&nbsp;</span><span style>The people who identified him were astonished.</span></p>
