 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style> “M-Malacus’s Cloak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a little too much.&nbsp;</span><span style>Weren’t vampires sensitive to the smell of blood?&nbsp;</span><span style>The vampires would come flocking like dogs if Malacus’ Cloak was used.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was like digging his grave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to wear this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner hesitated.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Grid and his colleagues showed a firm determination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Vantner, there is no time to spare.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Speed is important. We have to make them keep coming.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We will help you, so don’t worry and put on the cloak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Okay, I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every member of Overgeared was prepared to die.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner was no different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He prepared his mind and took the lead after wearing Malacus’ Cloak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t delay. He entered the large building in front of him.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"It is really wide. It is bigger than it seems from the outside.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is bad. It is better to fight a lot of enemies in a narrow space.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. This place is completely open without any cover.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The voices of the party members echoed in every corner.&nbsp;</span><span style>The first floor of the building was a huge hall. It could accommodate at least 2,000 people.&nbsp;</span><span style>The ceiling reached to the 7th floor and there were two staircases leading upstairs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think it’s better to get in a formation on the stairs, as it’ll be easier for us to be surrounded by the enemies on the upper levels than to be surrounded on all sides.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was Jishuka’s opinion.&nbsp;</span><span style>The other members agreed and quickly moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is dreary.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It is like a cemetery.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the center of the dark hallway, hundreds of coffins were randomly arranged. It was a creepy sight.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kung!</span></i> <i><span style>Kung kung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It happened when Grid’s party reached the stairs.&nbsp;</span><span style>The silent building suddenly became noisy.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because the hundreds of coffins started shaking in unison.&nbsp;</span><span style>The vampires sleeping in the coffins were reacting to the bloody smell of Malacus’ Cloak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"They’re coming!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be prepared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s group quickly got into formation and pulled out their weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a dark red greatbow that resembled a roaring dragon, a blue spear with a great appearance, gauntlets that seemed like they could easily crush the enemy, dazzling silver daggers and so on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were all Grid’s works.&nbsp;</span><span style>The existence of Grid for the Overgeared members was incredibly large.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kung!</span></i> <i><span style>Kung!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The coffins opened and the vampires appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had pale skin, long fangs, and red eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their red eyes turned towards Grid’s group. To be precise, it was towards Vantner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This fragrance is good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As soon as I open my eyes, I can celebrate with human blood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The vampires were the top predators.&nbsp;</span><span style>They didn’t feel any nervousness about the people who invaded their territory. Rather, they laughed like they were happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Fast!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The vampires living in the underground cities were different from those who popped up all over the continent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their combat power was between level 280~350.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give me blood! I shall enjoy it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ohuhut, shall we aim for that man’s clean neck?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 200 vampires quickly narrowed the distance to Grid’s group. It was a tremendous speed.&nbsp;</span><span style>They aimed for Vantner who monopolized their aggro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t think I can hold out for long! Guard of Steel! Guardian of Wisdom! Giant’s Blessing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[For three minutes, physical defense will increase by 30% and there will be a 50% increase in resistance to stabbing and cutting.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[For three minutes, magic resistance will increase by 30% and attributes resistance will increase by 50%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A shield that will absorb 20,000 damage has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner had invested all his stat points into strength until level 200.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Nonetheless, he was able to play his role as ranker thanks to the excellent defense skills of a guardian knight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sun Guard!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Flash!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A bright light shone on the bald Vantner. It was the reflection of the light emitted from his shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sudden emergence of light caused the vampires to lose momentum.&nbsp;</span><span style>Most of them lost their eyesight and stopped in place for a moment.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the 50 vampires in the rear were relatively fine.&nbsp;</span><span style>They hit Vantner first.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeong!</span></i> <i><span style>Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kukwakwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 5,600 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 5,980 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 7,110 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ack! It hurts! Hurts!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vampires had excellent physical abilities, magic power, and intelligence.&nbsp;</span><span style>They used magic to provoke Vantner’s magic resistance skills, then linked physical attacks. In some cases, it was the opposite.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner was unable to demonstrate a complete defense and was quickly wounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members weren’t watching quietly.&nbsp;</span><span style>Zednos started first.&nbsp;</span><span style>As Vantner pulled the aggro at the bottom of the stairs, he completed the long chant for the Storm of Eternity.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The storm rapidly rotated around a previously determined point, trapping the 50 vampires within and making unable to do anything.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the ultimate storm from the Storm Magician Zednos that could confine many enemies for a minimum of 30 seconds to a maximum of 5 minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style>The disadvantage was that no attacks from outside could occur, but it was a strategically useful magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well done!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to Zednos, Vantner could now breathe.&nbsp;</span><span style>He took a potion, while the remaining 150 vampires restored their eyesight and rushed over.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner’s suffering began from now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“S-Save me! Aaack~!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Papat!</span></i> <i><span style>Papapat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The vampires were skilled in hand to hand combat or swordsmanship, depending on their strength and agility.&nbsp;</span><span style>They aimed magic towards Vantner who was struggling to block the attacks with his shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cripple!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Dark Binding!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Neder’s Grab!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Various curse magic lowered Vantner’s magic resistance and his body was restrained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His limbs were caught by hands of darkness.&nbsp;</span><span style>The vampires’ swords aimed at his weak points.&nbsp;</span><span style>One greedy vampire even used his fangs.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner screamed as his neck was bitten and he was stabbed through the armor.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner felt a sense of hopelessness.&nbsp;</span><span style>If his health fell to the bottom when there was no healer, it was likely he would have to use his one-time invincible skill, ‘Guardian’s Power.’&nbsp;</span><span style>However, he needed to save this for Elfin Stone’s reappearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit! Do something!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner shouted as vampires constantly approached him.&nbsp;</span><span style>His colleagues responded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You are doing well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It will be over soon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon, Regas, Faker, and Peak Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Once all of the vampires were focused on Vantner, the four of them succeeded in efficiently killing.&nbsp;</span><span style>The vampires were taken by surprise and received fatal damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuhak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You dare! These humans!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The wounded vampires then shifted their gaze to the four people and said,</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The main character is here. Ah, should I say heroine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike the lower part of the stairway that was like hell, the upper part was tranquil.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka unabashedly exposed her sensual body and pulled her bowstring.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dozens of arrows soared into the air like missiles.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was once again a perfect surprise attack on the vampires defending against the onslaught of the four people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a flood of fire and blood.&nbsp;</span><span style>The silent and dark interior of the building quickly heated up.&nbsp;</span><span style>The vampires struggling in the sea of fire now had 60% health left.&nbsp;</span><span style>Finally, it was the turn of the protagonist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My Lord! Now!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your morale has increased.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your attack power and magic attack power will significantly rise for the next attack.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The next attack will be a critical hit!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi used the strongest buff on Grid. Grid</span><span style>&nbsp;withdrew from the party in order to monopolize the experience, took the experience buff potion and put on the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch.&nbsp;</span><span style>He used Blacksmith's Rage and started his sword dance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who said that dark spaces limited abilities?&nbsp;</span><span style>No, it was quite the opposite.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuoooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In the darkness, the blue Failure showed its true value. A powerful aura surrounded it and seeped into the area.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the precursor to the strongest wide area skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Transcended Link.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had risen one level after the Pascal raid, so the power of Transcended Link was incredible.&nbsp;</span><span style>Not only had the number of strikes and the damage increase, it also had a penetration effect.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwang!</span></i> <i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The blue-black energy blades swallowed everything in its path and attacked the vampires confronting the Overgeared members. Then it passed through the vampires that had just escaped from Zednos’ storm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Holy Light Gloves’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘5 Joint Attacks’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 5,490,500 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 5,670,000 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt...]</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>..</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This is a phenomenal record!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt over 100 million total damage in 5 seconds!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Reputation throughout the continent will rise by +5,000.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had to make 10 legendary items to get this much reputation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have recovered five draws of the machine!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an unexpected massive revenue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kiyaaaaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keooook!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The building echoed with screams.&nbsp;</span><span style>Most of the 200 vampires were seriously injured and trembled.&nbsp;</span><span style>The important thing was to increase his experience!&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid jumped from the stairs into the center of the vampires and used Wave.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kurururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The waves of energy stretched over all the vampires, dealing a huge blow and slowing them down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will take your blood!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The vampires were provoked and only focused on Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>At first glance, it seemed dangerous.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the Overgeared members couldn’t help Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a concern that they would be judged to deal more damage, greatly reducing the amount of experience gained by Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your attack has missed.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid showed a puzzled reaction.&nbsp;</span><span style>The vampires changed their bodies to black smoke, so all his skills and attacks missed.&nbsp;</span><span style>The momentum of the vampires rose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuhahahaha! I’m not someone who can be killed by a human!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your attacks can no longer harm us!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Shaaaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The black smoke moved like a hurricane around Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Once Grid was confused, they planned to use the blood transfusion skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it was impossible for their plan to be realized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Go around once.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid issued a command to someone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe? Randy?&nbsp;</span><span style>No.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had no intention of sharing his experience with the children.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid issued the command to Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Heok!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Rebecca artifact that was the antithesis of all beings with dark power!&nbsp;</span><span style>The power of the reproduction was weaker than the original, but it was enough to turn the vampires back to their bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"U-Unbelievable!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The vampires weren’t able to move properly. They were in a severely wounded state and influence by the divine power.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid looked at their forms that had lost their arrogance, as they crawled on the floor and tried to escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuhahahahat! These lovely guys!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The strongest boss, Elfin Stone.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was so happy about the experience in front of him that he forgot about Elfin Stone’s existence.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The blue greatsword killed a vampire every time it moved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, the vampires didn’t stay still. They tried to attack. But Jishuka and Zednos interrupted using arrows and magic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Pon, Regas, Faker and Peak Sword blocked any methods of retreat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The current Grid was on a bus from a huge conglomerate. No, he was on a comfortable plane.&nbsp;</span><span style>The destination was level 300.</span></p>
