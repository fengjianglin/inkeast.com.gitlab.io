 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Several months ago, Faker didn’t appreciate Grid when he first met him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was because Grid’s blacksmith ability and combat ability were excellent, but his mental immaturity meant he couldn’t exert all his abilities.&nbsp;</span><span style>To be honest, Faker never expressed it, but he thought Grid was ridiculous. He felt that Grid couldn’t take advantage of his class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now it was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>A long time had passed and Grid seemed different from the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If he keeps steadily growing like this, I can trust him with my back one day.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Faker was thinking, Grid showed the trap installation tools and poison combination machine to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"These are the items... I don’t know how to use them. There’s no manual.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faker was amazed as he looked at the items.&nbsp;</span><span style>“They’re good items. In particular, this poison combination machine is excellent. Where did you obtain it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I killed an assassin called Shay who dropped it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shay...? A user?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shay was the fifth ranked assassin user. He was a well established user, but it seemed he had been defeated by Grid and lost the item.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Shay is notorious for always going around with Kerb and Sniffer... Grid defeated the three of them alone? How strong is Grid now?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like the degree of growth exceeded Faker’s expectations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Jishuka and Vantner guessed that Grid was equal to or better than Pon and Regas...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought it was a joke, but maybe it was real?&nbsp;</span><span style>Faker was an aggressive person, like the other members of the Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>He felt the urge to compete against Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now wasn’t the time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wouldn’t it be better to learn how to use them next time? Look at the time. Your wedding is soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah, already?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid verified the time and exited the smithy. This wasn’t anyone else’s wedding. He couldn’t be late to his own wedding.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Tzedakah Guild and Khan followed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Khan looked depressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid... Grid has become the husband of the lady...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan lost his sick wife then his son. After being alone, he fell into drinking.&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to the trickery of the Mero Company, he had been on the verge of losing the smithy that had been in his family for generations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But one day, Grid suddenly appeared and saved him. He was able to escape from the pain of his life and rebuild the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was his savior.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was a similar age to Khan’s dead son and Khan truly treasured him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that precious person was leaving for a high place that Khan couldn’t reach.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, he was happy to see Grid doing well. However, he couldn’t hide his sad feelings.&nbsp;</span><span style>He barely swallowed back his tears as he spoke to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid, you might be a commoner marrying into a family of nobles, but don’t shrink back and live well. I am always cheering for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid grinned at Khan’s encouragement.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I’m Pagma’s Descendant. Why should I shrink back from nobles? And don’t talk like we are breaking up. I will still go to the smithy like before, even if I marry Irene. Have you forgotten? I am your successor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It must be annoying to help a poor and sick old man, but Grid didn’t show it at all.&nbsp;</span><span style>Khan was thrilled and tears ended up spilling down.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid handed him a handkerchief and said,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Your son asked me to do something. He asked me to take care of his father.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t a lie.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past, Grid had gone to Khan’s family cemetery with Khan and encountered ghosts while Khan was sleeping.&nbsp;</span><span style>Among the ghosts, Khan’s ancestor gave him the clue to obtain Pagma’s Swordsmanship, and Khan’s son asked Grid to take care of his father.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A son who worried about his father even after death!&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid liked Khan and was touched by his son’s devotion, so he tried to do well by Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, it wasn’t an unconditional favor. To be honest, some of his actions were calculated to inherit the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style>But that didn’t affect the fact that he liked Khan. That emotion still remained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Khan’s expression started to slowly contort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid... Why is your handkerchief so dirty? Is this a rag?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It isn’t a rag. It is a handkerchief. But I didn’t wash it, so it looks like a rag. Hahaha! Well, it is okay. Are you going to die if you wipe your tears with a rag?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Tsk tsk, you’re worse than an old widower... I’m relieved that the maids will take care of you after you marry the lady.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the Tzedakah Guild were looking at Grid and Khan with warm eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid looked great in their eyes, demonstrating that users and NPCs could really be friends.&nbsp;</span><span style>NPCs had the same emotions as humans. They felt ashamed of themselves for ignoring this fact and treating NPCs as a simple artificial intelligence in a game.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the party arrived at the castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Welcome!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The knights and soldiers already recognized Grid as their lord. He was lauded as a hero and was going to become the husband of the lady.&nbsp;</span><span style>They entered the castle’s garden, where the beautiful bride welcomed Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lady Irene...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her white dress highlighted her beauty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Irene, who was making a shy smile, was beautiful enough to compare with Yura and Jishuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ack...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This beautiful and noble woman was being taken away by Grid!&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner swallowed back his tears. Then he discovered Knight Bland crying with a runny nose and felt a sense of homogeneity with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You too, Lady Irene...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two people exchanged glances as the grand marriage ceremony was held.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dozens of senior nobles from all over the kingdom as well as foreign envoys were present. Earl Steim’s speech and the congratulatory message from the king’s messenger increased the atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There are foreign envoys and even a message from the king... It isn’t an exaggeration that Earl Steim is one of the kingdom’s greatest powers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka admired. She only went under Irene because of Grid, but now it seemed to be wise decision in many ways.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No matter how I think about it, Grid is truly amazing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka thought with a smile. Then the military band started to play light and cheerful music.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hundreds of people watched as Grid and Irene exchanged vows of love.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you swear to respect and love one another until you become light and return to Goddess Rebecca’s side?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I swear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I swear."</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one said it first.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid and Irene responded and the same time, and the guests cheered like they were soulmates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Share the token of your pledge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Token of the pledge?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid couldn’t understand the officiant’s words. The bride’s side had taken care of all wedding preparations, so he couldn’t help panicking.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Irene handed him a pair of rings.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the finest gold ring with a diamond in the middle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Put these rings on our hands.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Irene shyly said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her red face was so lovely that Grid picked up the small ring with trembling hands. Then he slid it on Irene’s finger. Irene also placed the ring on Grid’s finger.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then a notification window flashed in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have worn the Ring of Pledge. If you are with the person wearing the same ring, special effects will occur.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have pledged eternal love with Irene Winston von Steim.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have become the husband of a lady.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You can now check the estate’s information using the authority of the lady’s husband. However, you have no right to decide estate policy.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You will gain more benefits and have a stronger voice the higher your wife’s liking towards you.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[If your wife’s liking is low, the worst case scenario is a divorce. Be careful.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have become an earl’s son-in-law.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Nobility stat has been opened.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[All stats have increased by 20.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You can advance into the social circle of the nobles.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You will receive a monthly salary of 500 gold.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s mouth dropped open.&nbsp;</span><span style>His fortune seemed to be increasing thanks to his beautiful, competent, and kind bride.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Earl Steim watched his daughter blush as Grid put the ring on her and suddenly found Khan. He approached Khan and handed him a drink.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Are you Grid’s friend?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan looked up with surprise and asked,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Why is a great person like Your Lordship interested in someone like me…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t speak like that. Aren’t you a blacksmith who represents the north and a friend of my son-in-law? It is an honor to talk to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, there was a flurry of drinking.&nbsp;</span><span style>Most people drank alcohol like water while blessing the bride and groom.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner and Bland got drunk together and cursed the bridegroom, causing Knight Captain Phoenix to expel them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were foreign envoys and senior nobles who discretely laughed at the fact that the groom was a commoner, but the good mood was sustained because Faker secretly stunned them and placed them asleep in a corner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the residents and users in Winston were also celebrating. There was the festive atmosphere of fireworks and music.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lady Irene got married!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh! It is to our hero!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I hope that the lady will give birth to a son!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes! I am looking forward to the future!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The NPCs learned that Irene’s marriage partner was Grid and danced with joy.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the users didn’t know the details and weren’t very interested in Irene’s marriage. They were delighted about other parts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Irene, the lady of Winston, has married and blessed everyone!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[All Winston products will be exempt from taxes for the next 10 days.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Users who set Winston as their residence will gain a 50% increase in experience and 30% increase in item acquisition for the next 15 days.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Users who have settled in a city or village that belongs to Earl Steim will gain a 30% increase in experience and 15% increase in item acquisition for the next 10 days.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was good luck!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The millions of users in Earl Steim’s territory started to hunt hard to take advantage of this opportunity. Users heard the rumors and moved to Earl Steim’s territories to experience this event, causing these areas to have an enormous population growth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Among them, the number of population heading to Winston was unequaled.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Winston’s population was already saturated. The users who planned to move to Winston were forced to look at other villages near Winston.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those villages included Bairan, which was managed by the Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>The village of Bairan was a territory under Winston and as a result, it was able to achieve tremendous growth in a short period of time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thousands of people migrated every day, hundreds of new houses were built, the number of shops increased and the economy was booming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah~! What is this? I am too busy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka and the Tzedakah Guild cried out. If this trend continued, the money would pour in, but they were worried about being too busy to have time to level up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then let’s go back in time to the wedding night!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was naked and facing Irene, who had uncovered her white body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Beautiful..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm embarrassed...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene had a wide pelvis and long slender limbs, like a model.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her breasts were only a B cup, making it somewhat inadequate for Grid’s taste.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid wasn't disappointed.&nbsp;</span><span style>The shape of Irene’s breasts was perfect and the harmony of colors was wonderful... The details will be omitted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Irene!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh my.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The excited Grid lowered Irene onto the bed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he immediately used the techniques described in the book he read before accessing Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>The techniques were very dazzling... The details will be omitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whenever Grid’s long and hard fingers swept over Irene’s white and soft skin... The details will be omitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene shed tears as she was surrounded by pleasures she had never experienced in her 20 years of living. The pleasure she felt was so huge that she was almost scared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m scared... I feel like another person... It feels like I will fly away somewhere...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His hands gave her such pleasure that it was hard to believe Grid was a virgin.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reason he could demonstrate such excellent hand techniques wasn’t because he read the book, but because he was influenced by his high dexterity stat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The combination of his stats and titles meant that he had over 1,500 dexterity, transcending human limitations.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sometimes delicate! Sometimes strong! He was able to perfectly control the tempo as his hands swept over Irene’s whole body. It was almost enough to give him the title of caressing king.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid... Hurry...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Irene!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene looked up at him with a yearning expression.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment Grid met that gaze, he let go of his reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He took a deep breath as for the first time in his 27 years of life... The details will be omitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh... Grid! I love you...! I love you!! I love you!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the night grew deeper, the intensity of Irene’s pleasure grew.&nbsp;</span><span style>Combined with the title effects, Grid’s strength exceeded 1,600 and his stamina exceeded 1,000, so Grid was comparable to the legendary virile king.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to that, Irene was surrounded by pleasures that ordinary women never experienced... The details will be omitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Irene’s liking towards you has increased.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Irene’s liking towards you has increased.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Irene’s liking towards you has increased...]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene’s love towards him grew bigger every time Grid moved his waist... The details will be omitted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the first night was a great success.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was able to achieve the maximum liking with Irene in just one night.</span></p>
