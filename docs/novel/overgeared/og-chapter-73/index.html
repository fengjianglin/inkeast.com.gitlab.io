 <p><span>Chapter 73</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <hr>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>I lost my temper and challenged the enhancement of the Ideal Dagger again using the remaining four enhancement stones.&nbsp;</span><span>This time, even though I reached +5 without failing...</span></p>
 <p><span>[A weapon enhancement stone (1) has been consumed.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[You have failed to strengthen the +5 Ideal Dagger.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The +5 Ideal Dagger has decreased by 3.]</span></p>
 <p><span>“Dammit!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Obviously, the Ideal Dagger was a unique rated dagger.&nbsp;</span><span>I knew that the higher the rating, the lower the probability of enhancement.&nbsp;</span><span>But I was Pagma’s Descendant, and it was a mockery for Pagma’s descendant to fail to reach +6 consecutively!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Damn...damn!”</span></p>
 <p><span>I had spent 1,000 gold to buy 10 enhancement stones, but the result of said gold was merely a +3 enhancement.&nbsp;</span><span>I couldn’t just leave it like this.&nbsp;</span><span>I was filled with poison as I headed to the auction house again and purchased another 10 enhancement stones.</span></p>
 <p><span>"If I fail to reach +6 again, I will use the blessed enhancement stones...”</span></p>
 <p><span>The price was too expensive, so I wanted to sell the blessed enhancement stones instead of using them.&nbsp;</span><span>Having lost my temper, I was ready to use the blessed enhancement stones as I once again challenged strengthening the Ideal Dagger.&nbsp;</span><span>Then!</span></p>
 <p><span>[A weapon enhancement stone (1) has been consumed.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The +5 Ideal Dagger has been strengthened.]</span></p>
 <p><span>“Oh...! Ohh!!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The moment the Ideal Dagger became +6, a blue aura started circulating around it.&nbsp;</span><span>I was thrilled.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Beautiful...”</span></p>
 <p><span>+5 enhancement couldn’t be seen with the naked eye, so there was no obvious difference between +0 and +5 items. There were no features.&nbsp;</span><span>But after reaching +6, the Ideal Dagger had a change in appearance. The color that manifested was representative of the item’s attribute.</span></p>
 <p><span>“If people see this...?”</span></p>
 <p><span>I immediately went to the city square. I held the +6 Ideal Dagger and struck a nice pose, like a movie poster.&nbsp;</span><span>People immediately turned to look at me.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Wow, look at that weapon! It’s at least +6!”</span></p>
 <p><span>"It has a blue aura. Really beautiful...”</span></p>
 <p><span>They admired the Ideal Dagger in my hand.</span></p>
 <p><span>"He must be rich to enhance a weapon to +6. Should I tempt him once?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hey, he might just be lucky with the enhancement. Don’t act too carelessly.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Wow... this is the first time I’ve seen a +6 weapon. Mine is only +3. I’m envious.”</span></p>
 <p><span>I was ecstatic as people looked at me with envy</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Huhuhu... a +6 weapon is truly special. I used a lot of money to enhance it to this.’</span></p>
 <p><span>The central square.&nbsp;</span><span>The gazes of the people gradually changed from admiring the +6 dagger to looking at me like I was a madman.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Bah, boasting like this when you only have a lowly +6 dagger.”</span></p>
 <p><span>At that moment, a familiar voice was heard behind me.&nbsp;</span><span>I looked back and confirmed the identity of the voice.&nbsp;</span><span>The person was...</span></p>
 <p><span>"Katz!"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Blood Warrior Katz!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Katz was among the top 40 rankings and had the third epic class.&nbsp;</span><span>People cried out as they witnessed his appearance in the square.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Why is that bastard here?’</span></p>
 <p><span>I knew Katz. I didn’t personally know him, but he was an infamous troublemaker who often appeared on TV.&nbsp;</span><span>In other words, Katz didn’t know me.&nbsp;</span><span>That guy was staring straight into my eyes.&nbsp;</span><span>He looked me up and down with a mocking expression and said,&nbsp;</span><span>“Heh...you are too vulgar.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"What are you implying all of a sudden?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Katz shrugged at my words before pulling out the sword at his waist. His sword shone orange like the sun.&nbsp;</span><span>It even hurt my eyes.&nbsp;</span><span>The users in the square cried out with amazement and Katz laughed,</span></p>
 <p><span>“Puhahaha! How about it? Isn’t this different? This is the majesty of a +8 weapon! A stupendous weapon that a person like you can’t get your hands on for all your life! Puhahaha!”</span></p>
 <p><span>He laughed before leaving the square with dignified steps.&nbsp;</span><span>The crowd was dismayed as they looked at his back.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What is this? Did he come just to show off his item?"</span></p>
 <p><span>“He’s just like the rumors say...”</span></p>
 <p><span>"My goal, goal.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The people clicked their tongue at Katz.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>They ridiculed Katz before going back to their daily lives.&nbsp;</span><span>But I couldn’t move from where I was standing. I shook because I couldn’t suppress the sense of defeat.</span></p>
 <p><span>"That bastard, he dared disgrace me? He is just an epic class, yet he talks such nonsense to a legendary class?”</span></p>
 <p><span>After this, I couldn’t just be satisfied with a +6 weapon.&nbsp;</span><span>I returned to the smithy. Then I took out the two blessed weapon enhancement stones that were in a corner of my inventory.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I am Pagma’s Descendant. Blood Warrior? X him!”</span></p>
 <p><span>[The blessed weapon enhancement stone (1) has been consumed.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The +6 Ideal Dagger has been strengthened.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The blessed weapon enhancement stone (1) has been consumed.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The +7 Ideal Dagger has been strengthened.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The item enhancement value is +8, so the option effect is slightly increased.]</span></p>
 <p><span>“...Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span>I succeeded successively with the blessed enhancement stones.&nbsp;</span><span>The blue aura of the Ideal Dagger became stronger.&nbsp;</span><span>If Katz’ sword was like the sun, then the Ideal Dagger was a deep blue like the sea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hah...! Hahahaha! Puhahaha!”</span></p>
 <p><span>[+8 Ideal Dagger]</span></p>
 <p><span>Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span>Durability: 168/168 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 378~413 &nbsp;Attack Speed: +13%</span></p>
 <p><span>* There is a rare chance of instantaneously killing the target.</span></p>
 <p><span>* Agility +30</span></p>
 <p><span>* The skill ‘Wind Blast’ is generated.</span></p>
 <p><span>* The skill ‘Quick Movements’ is generated.</span></p>
 <p><span>A dagger created by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but lacks experience and reputation. It was made with the renowned blacksmith Khan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>There is nothing special about the materials or method used, but both the craftsman’s skill and the co-operation with Khan have created an ideal dagger.</span></p>
 <p><span>User Restriction: Level 180 or higher. More than 450 agility.&nbsp;</span><span>Advanced Dagger Mastery.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>The attack power of a dagger, not a longsword or greatsword, was over 400.&nbsp;</span><span>Thanks to the unexpected encounter with Katz, I succeeded in the enhancement and got a top-class weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span>As I was feeling jubilant, Huroi entered the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span>“My Liege! What happened with the raid?”</span></p>
 <p><span>I looked at Huroi carefully and lied,&nbsp;</span><span>“Um... unfortunately, the raid failed, so there are no items. I’m sorry about the result, despite your courageous sacrifice.”</span></p>
 <p><span>In fact, the raid was successful. As a result, I obtained a lot of items.&nbsp;</span><span>But I lied that the raid had failed.&nbsp;</span><span>Why? I was concerned that Huroi would ask me to share the items if he knew the raid succeeded.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huroi trembled after hearing the result.&nbsp;</span><span>“It is because I was incompetent. Kuock... I will now leave to train! So that next time, I am able to help My Liege!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Y-Yes...”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huroi left after making the oath, and I prepared to leave for Kesan Canyon.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I have the Ideal Dagger as a weapon and Khan is making armor...”</span></p>
 <p><span>I had the orc chief’s helmet. The only thing left was the creation of gauntlets and boots.&nbsp;</span><span>I pulled out a hammer and started making the gauntlets and boots.&nbsp;</span><span>Then two days later.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Khan’s Masterpiece]</span></p>
 <p><span>Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span>Durability: 300/300 &nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 359 Movement Speed: -7%</span></p>
 <p><span>* 20% reduction in damage from physical attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span>This armor is made using the know-how that the best blacksmith in the north of the Eternal Kingdom, Khan accumulated in his life.</span></p>
 <p><span>The inner armor made from the leather of the frostlight orc absorbs impact from the outside well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Khan proudly calls this armor the masterpiece of his life.</span></p>
 <p><span>User Restriction: Level 160 or higher. More than 550 strength. More than 480 stamina. Intermediate Heavy Armor Mastery.</span></p>
 <p><span>Weight: 1,900&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>[The Best Gauntlets]</span></p>
 <p><span>Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span>Durability: 150/150 &nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 47 Attack Speed: +4% &nbsp;&nbsp;Accuracy +8%</span></p>
 <p><span>* There is a slim chance to activate ‘Double Barrage.’</span></p>
 <p><span>An item made by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but his experience and reputation is somewhat lacking.</span></p>
 <p><span>Helps you attack the target faster and more accurately.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>User Restriction: Level 160 or higher. More than 150 agility.</span></p>
 <p><span>Weight: 220&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>[Adventurer's Boots]</span></p>
 <p><span>Rating: Rare</span></p>
 <p><span>Durability: 120/120 &nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 60 Movement Speed: +6%</span></p>
 <p><span>An item made by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but his experience and reputation is somewhat lacking.</span></p>
 <p><span>It is comfortable to wear. Ideal for long-distance travel.</span></p>
 <p><span>User Restriction: Level 160 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span>Weight: 200&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Okay, this is perfect! I made an epic and rare item and got my stats, so should I go?”</span></p>
 <p><span>I headed towards the Kesan Canyon without any delay.&nbsp;</span><span>Then I arrived at Kesan Canyon.&nbsp;</span><span>I recalled past memories as I looked at the canyon.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I came here only to die, die and die...”</span></p>
 <p><span>It was so terrible that Kesan Canyon kept appearing in my dreams.&nbsp;</span><span>I experienced so much horror here. I would only be able to sleep by defeating Kesan Canyon.</span></p>
 <p><span>"The monsters here are so weird...”</span></p>
 <p><span>The monsters of Kesan Canyon were incredibly grotesque in both both their appearance and inclination.&nbsp;</span><span>Among them, the ‘canyon spider’ was the one I remembered vividly.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘The giant spider eats people alive. Uhh...’</span></p>
 <p><span>The shock and horror of being trapped in a spider web and not able to move as the spider’s mouth neared me.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I’m glad that I didn’t feel myself being chewed because I died the moment my head entered its mouth...’</span></p>
 <p><span>I shuddered at the memories of that time and cleared my mind.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Stop wasting time on useless thoughts and find Pagma’s swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span>In the past, I kept dying here.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Now I am different! I will show you the power of items, you monsters! Revenge! Revenge!”</span></p>
 <p><span>I cried out as I entered the canyon. But unlike my words, my body was trembling.&nbsp;</span><span>The memories of the past made me very scared.</span></p>
