 <p><span>A orb designed by the dwarven craftsman Milepeu, who taught Pagma before he became a legend.</span></p>
 <p><span>The crystal ball made by combining the abyss mithril, Frost Queen’s Breath and Water Clan King’s Tears allows it to contain enormous power and special functions.</span></p>
 <p><span>User Restriction: Level 280 or higher. More than 3,000 intelligence. Advanced Orb Mastery Level 5.</span></p>
 <p><span>Weight: 150</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid was astounded as he checked the orb’s information.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘A magic possession item?’</span></p>
 <p><span>The concept of storing and possession was different.&nbsp;</span><span>Stored magic was consumed once it was used, while possessed magic became the unique function of the item and could be used permanently.&nbsp;</span><span>It was reminiscent of the Fly magic that belonged to Braham’s Boots and allowed non-magicians to fly.</span></p>
 <p><span>The efficiency of magic possession items were excellent. Depending on what magic the item possessed, the use could become very different.&nbsp;</span><span>Indeed, millions of people wanted magic possession items. They wanted a magic possession item for themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span>But they were rare treasures that couldn’t be bought even with money.&nbsp;</span><span>Even some of the earliest users who had been playing Satisfy since it opened couldn’t see a magic possession item. There was only a rare chance of acquiring them through monster hunting, boss raids and quest rewards.&nbsp;</span><span>In the past, it wasn’t an exaggeration to say that Vantner would’ve paid everything he had to buy Braham’s Boots off Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘It’s an area that blacksmiths can’t produce.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid was a legendary blacksmith, but he didn’t know how to make magic possession items.&nbsp;</span><span>His (Witness of God’s Weapon) Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill was level 5, but the knowledge about how to make magic possession items was blank.</span></p>
 <p><span>Based on this, Grid assumed that Pagma didn’t know how to make magic possession items.&nbsp;</span><span>But now he learned how to make Mumud’s Orb.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid became the first and only person in the world of two billion users to create a magic possession item.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘If I study Mumud’s Orb, I might be able to figure out how to make magic possession items.’</span></p>
 <p><span>The dwarven craftsman Milepeu, who taught Pagma.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid also got a chance to receive his teachings through this work.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kkuok.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Grid held the Legendary Blacksmith’s Hammer with all his strength.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Dugun dugun.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>His heart beat wildly.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Ssik.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>A smile appeared on his face.&nbsp;</span><span>There was a sense of excitement. He was filled with joy.</span></p>
 <p><span>'Through this production...’</span></p>
 <p><span>He would grow.&nbsp;</span><span>He could go beyond Pagma in this specific area.&nbsp;</span><span>In return for this opportunity to grow, he would bless Euphemina by producing a unique rated orb for her.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid confirmed the list of materials needed for the production and reached out to Euphemina.</span></p>
 <p><span>Then Euphemina handed him the materials.</span></p>
 <p>[5 <span id="footnote-5">abyss mithril have been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[One Frost Queen’s Breath has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[One Water Clan King’s Tears has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span><span><a href="#footnote-22" id="footnoteref-22"></a></span></span></p>
 <p>[22 <span id="footnote-22">deluxe magic stones have been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>“I’m asking you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>These were the precious materials that she barely collected after investing half a year and going through all types of incidents.&nbsp;</span><span>The mithril abyss, Frost Queen’s Breath and Water Clan King’s Tears were impossible to determine the value, while the magic stones were worth 4,000 gold each.</span></p>
 <p><span>What if the orb was created using these materials and an epic or lower rating emerged?&nbsp;</span><span>She wouldn’t be able to hide her disappointment.&nbsp;</span><span>Euphemina was eager to avoid such a thing, while Grid gladly nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Believe in me.”</span></p>
 <p><span>At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘This is serious.’&nbsp;</span><span>Lauel had been remaining silent to not interfere with the two people, but his complexion quickly deteriorated.&nbsp;</span><span>He had been with Grid for a while, so he was well aware that when Grid told people to believe in him, the worst result would emerge.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Okay. I’ll believe in you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Euphemina was delighted without knowing anything.</span></p>
 <p><span>Lauel smiled awkwardly at her.&nbsp;</span><span>"Let’s leave Grid alone so that he can concentrate.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span>She smiled.&nbsp;</span><span>Euphemina felt better thanks to Grid and beamed brightly.&nbsp;</span><span>Lauel made a sad expression and left the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span>Lauel gritted his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘A unique orb has gone away.’</span></p>
 <p><span>It was the worst.&nbsp;</span><span>Lauel wanted to make Euphemina join Grid. If Grid was to produce a unique or higher rated orb, it was likely that Euphemina would become Grid’s slave.&nbsp;</span><span>However, the situation wasn’t right, so he couldn’t help feeling uneasy.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘It would’ve been big if she became our colleague...’</span></p>
 <p><span>Some people might calmly enjoy Satisfy in their own way.&nbsp;</span><span>Those who suffered from disabilities in reality could enjoy a normal day, places more beautiful than Earth could be seen, or they could enjoy foods that didn’t exist in reality.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, Satisfy had the system of level up and a gap between the rich and the poor.&nbsp;</span><span>In the end, a competitive society was inevitable.&nbsp;</span><span>Due to that, only a few users played Satisfy like a regular online game.</span></p>
 <p><span>They frantically levelled up and competed against each other.&nbsp;</span><span>They tried to build power, wealth, and reputation, so they could someday become nobles and kings.&nbsp;</span><span>Satisfy’s vast territory, currently owned by NPC nobles and royalty, would gradually fall into the hands of users.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was a natural flow and Lauel hoped to piggyback on Grid along that flow. He dreamed that the person he followed would become a king.&nbsp;</span><span>In order to do that, he needed a lot of human resources such as Euphemina. Thus, Lauel was very disappointed at missing this chance.</span></p>
 <p><span>On the other hand, Huroi was belatedly thanking Euphemina.&nbsp;</span><span>"I really appreciate it. In the past and this time, you saved my life.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Euphemina explained,&nbsp;</span><span>"It was Grid, not me, who helped you in the past. I just helped Grid to clear my own quest. So don’t think about the past. This time... it’s too hard to pretend that I didn’t see it, so it isn’t something to be thankful for.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Euphemina was the type of person to deceive others to accomplish her goals. But she wasn’t heartless towards those she knew.&nbsp;</span><span>This was her weakness and strength.&nbsp;</span><span>Euphemina blushed as she replied to Huroi’s thanks.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huroi quietly smiled as he watched her.&nbsp;</span><span>Thanks to her, his life was saved from Kasim and he avoided losing any experience. He was going to repay the favor someday.&nbsp;</span><span>As such, Euphemina built up a positive impression with Grid and Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, Euphemina wasn’t aware of this fact.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid got a precious production method for free, while Huroi could keep his experience.&nbsp;</span><span>But her only interest was on the result of the orb.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Puruk!</span></em> <em><span>Puruk!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>A sound was heard from inside the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span>Euphemina peeked at Grid through a small window.&nbsp;</span><span>His sweating appearance in front of the blast furnace was very attractive.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘He has changed.’</span></p>
 <p><span>The Grid in Euphemina’s memories was very different. His appearance was less than ordinary.&nbsp;</span><span>Now Grid had a good appearance.&nbsp;</span><span>She liked the high nose and moderately protruding forehead, and his eyes without double eyelids emanated the mysterious charm of Asians.&nbsp;</span><span>It was difficult to call him a handsome person. However, he had a look that would appeal to quite a few people.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘He doesn’t appear to have had plastic surgery... Anyway, the difference is his hairstyle and facial expression. His physique has also improved.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Previously, Grid’s hair covered his good forehead and nose. It was just messy.&nbsp;</span><span>In addition, his expression was always full of discontent and he kept complaining.&nbsp;</span><span>She couldn’t feel any attractiveness from a man who had no muscles. His slumped shoulders and bent over back were especially jarring.&nbsp;</span><span>But now his hairstyle was neat, his physique improved, his expressions and gestures showed confidence, making his overall impression completely different than before.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘It is a miraculous change.’</span></p>
 <p><span>It felt good.&nbsp;</span><span>She thought seriously about whether someday she could also make a more positive change.&nbsp;</span><span>It was the moment when Grid’s existence became big in the journey of her maturing process.</span></p>
