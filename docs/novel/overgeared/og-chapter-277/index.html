 <p><span>Chapter 277</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <hr>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>Rankers were mainly popular around the world, but Grid was different.&nbsp;</span><span>Most foreigners disliked Grid.&nbsp;</span><span>There were those who mocked and criticized him for his poor control skills in the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span>But at this moment, the flow started to change.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid elevated his control after endless efforts and was silencing the criticism against him.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Aura Festival!”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Pepeng!</span></em> <em><span>Pepepepeong!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>It was like firecrackers.&nbsp;</span><span>The chain of aura explosions put pressure on Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span>'Let's concentrate.’</span></p>
 <p><span>It was a great skill, but there was no need to shrink back in front of it.&nbsp;</span><span>A red light shone from Grid’s eyes.&nbsp;</span><span>He utilized his high insight to grasp the trajectory of the explosions and evade, causing the viewers to feel admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span>[You have suffered 2,362 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[You have suffered 2,510 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[You have suffered 2,487...]</span></p>
 <p><span>The advantage of Aura Festival was its range. It was such a widespread attack that it was impossible to avoid them all &nbsp;completely with Grid’s agility.&nbsp;</span><span>However, it was such a large-scale skill that its damage was weak. Allowing a few attacks wasn’t fatal.&nbsp;</span><span>Thanks to the doppelganger’s accessory set, his indomitable stat was maximized and helped reduce the damage.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kuooooh!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The atmosphere in the sky started swarming towards Grid.&nbsp;</span><span>A huge explosion of energy burst from Grid. No, it was at the level of a gravity pull.&nbsp;</span><span>It was the precursor to Grid’s conversion from a close range damage dealer to a ranged damage dealer.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Transcend.”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Supak!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Every time Grid swung the sword,</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kukwakwang!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>An energy blade was shot at Fulito on the ground.&nbsp;</span><span>The momentum was comparable to lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The attack speed and downpour of energy blades from Grid served as a disaster for Fulito.&nbsp;</span><span>Failure hit once. Then the Doppelganger’s Greatsword hit once again.&nbsp;</span><span>The two greatswords that were continuously swung without rest were fast and strong. They didn’t give Fulito any breathing room.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘An entirely different level!’</span></p>
 <p><span>Fulito ran around the crumbling ground and gradually realized the seriousness of the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘A single number...!’</span></p>
 <p><span>The single number knights were a target of awe for their fellow Red Knights.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid’s skills resembled them.&nbsp;</span><span>From the moment Aura Festival was beaten, Fulito had already determined the gap between himself and Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Eternal! A mere small kingdom was hiding a monster like this!’</span></p>
 <p><span>It was scandalous and dangerous.&nbsp;</span><span>He had to tell this fact to the emperor. There was an obligation to raise their vigilance towards the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Peeng!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Fulito was hit in the right shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Damn!’</span></p>
 <p><span>He was helpless.&nbsp;</span><span>He couldn’t avoid the storm of energy blades that was pouring towards him.&nbsp;</span><span>Fulito used Super Armor.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The golden protective layer neutralized the energy blades. It was tremendous defense, but unfortunately, the duration of Super Armor wasn’t very long.&nbsp;</span><span>Fulito shouted to the Black Knights.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I will retreat! Tie up his feet and earn me some time!”</span></p>
 <p><span>It was a desperate command.&nbsp;</span><span>The Black Knights paled at the thought of sacrificing themselves.&nbsp;</span><span>But the principles of the subordinates were absolute.&nbsp;</span><span>The Black Knights grasped their swords and attacked.&nbsp;</span><span>They confronted Grid’s energy blades to allow Fulito to retreat.</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid stopped using Transcend and descended to the ground before using Link.</span></p>
 <p><span>"This is Huroi’s share.”</span></p>
 <p><span>It was punishment for their sin of attacking Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Chaaeng!</span></em> <em><span>Chaeeeeeng!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The Black Knights’ attacks were offset by Link and then the onslaught began.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Pit!</span></em> <em><span>Pipipipipit!</span></em></p>
 <p><em><span>Puhwahak!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>"Kuaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Blood emerged from the seams of the black armor.&nbsp;</span><span>His swordsmanship combined with Vital Spot Detection was much more mature compared to the past.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Don’t send...!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The Black Knights barely managed to strike back against Grid.&nbsp;</span><span>They all aimed at him.&nbsp;</span><span>They used their strongest skills, without caring about defense.&nbsp;</span><span>It was an obvious crisis for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span>-</span><em><span>Wow.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>-</span><em><span>Will Grid die?</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The viewers were immersed in the broadcast and forgot to eat their chicken.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Hwiririk!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>A white hooded zip up was seen.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid used the movements that he saw when Piaro sparred against Faker and rotated his body like a spin top.&nbsp;</span><span>The Black Knights simultaneously used five skills, but two of them were non-targeted skills and didn’t hit him. He was lightly grazed and only received minor damage.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Shit!"</span></p>
 <p><span>The frustrated Black Knights found themselves covered in a blue light.&nbsp;</span><span>Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Wave threatened the five Black Knights.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This is my share!”</span></p>
 <p><span>This was punishment for the sin of aiming their swords against him!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Kuheok!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The waves of energy that stretched out from Grid caused the Black Knights to scream.&nbsp;</span><span>In the process, Grid was hit by three skills, but he suffered less damage than the Black Knights.&nbsp;</span><span>It was natural.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid was currently armed with the armor set made by the legendary blacksmith Pagma out of a god mineral.</span></p>
 <p><span>"This is my share! Pinnacle!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Why do you have another share?”</span></p>
 <p><span>The behavior of Grid, who took more of a share than the beaten up Huroi, confused the Black Knights.&nbsp;</span><span>Anyway, the attack hit them regardless of their feelings.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Seokeok!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The Black Knights were slowed by the effects of Grid, and the one in the front had his armor completely broken by Grid. It was the power of Failure.</span></p>
 <p><span>[You have defeated Black Knight Dever.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[8,960,000 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span><span><a href="#footnote-79" id="footnoteref-79"></a></span></span></p>
 <p>[79&nbsp;<span id="footnote-79">gold has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid had gained a large amount of experience from Kamiyan, so he enjoyed the sight of the level up notification window.&nbsp;</span><span>He was now level 296.&nbsp;</span><span>There were four more levels left until he reached 300.&nbsp;</span><span>Very soon, his stats would undergo the third awakening.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Ssik!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Laughing while cutting a person in half?&nbsp;</span><span>Grid was wearing a bizarre mask with an eerie red light behind it.&nbsp;</span><span>He looked like a blood covered demon as he laughed.&nbsp;</span><span>In other words, he seemed crazy.</span></p>
 <p><span>-</span><em><span>It reminds me of old times.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>-</span><em><span>When Grid was called the Butcher?</span></em></p>
 <p><span>-</span><em><span>Right.</span></em> <em><span>It when when he killed the Giant Guild. At that time, a regular user going against the Giant Guild. It was invigorating to watch.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>What was the reason why users became fans of rankers?&nbsp;</span><span>It was because they could live vicariously through them.&nbsp;</span><span>The users were thrilled when they saw the rankers do things that were impossible for them. Then they gradually became fans.&nbsp;</span><span>This was how the viewers watching Grid felt now. There were also foreigners watching the broadcast through the web channel. In the chat window, the anti-fans fell silent.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Teong!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Grid used Fly magic to break through the Black Knight that turned into ash.&nbsp;</span><span>He moved at a fast speed and reached Fulito, before switching his shoes.&nbsp;</span><span>Braham’s Boots disappeared and Grid’s Boots were equipped.</span></p>
 <p><span>At the same time, the Fly spell was turned off. Grid’s body rapidly gained weight and fell to the ground.&nbsp;</span><span>Fulito used a skill to defend against the two greatswords that were falling rapidly.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Red Sword!”</span></p>
 <p><span>It was one of the strongest skills passed down through the Red Knights for generations. A secret technique that only the Red Knights from the 10s onwards could receive.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Hwaruruk!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The golden aura around Fulito’s sword was stained red.&nbsp;</span><span>It was flames itself.&nbsp;</span><span>The flames flying towards Grid were enough to blow away a small mountain.&nbsp;</span><span>But the viewers knew.</span></p>
 <p><span>-</span><em><span>Grid has more skills.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>-</span><em><span>Legendary skills.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>“Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The greatsword was strengthened by Grid’s Boots, so the fierce Kill decided Victory.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Peeeeeong!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>“Heeok?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Kill crushed the Red Sword that it collided with.&nbsp;</span><span>One of the Red Knights, with their 300 years of history, collapsed to this extent?&nbsp;</span><span>Fulito’s face was stunned as the blow overwhelmed the Red Sword.&nbsp;</span><span>Fulito screamed as he offset half the power of Kill with Limit Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Who the hell are you? How could a strong person like you be so anonymous in the meantime?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Fulito had determined that the source of Grid’s power was in the artifacts, including the golden spear.&nbsp;</span><span>But that was a clear misjudgment.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid’s strength was his swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span>It was a rare transcendental swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p><span>Transcendental swordsmanship!&nbsp;</span><span>It wasn’t an exaggeration.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid had inherited the powers of Pagma, the legendary blacksmith and great swordsman, as well as studied under Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span>Just looking at this environmental aspects, Grid had the foundations to leapfrog above existing legends.</span></p>
 <p><span>The problem was that his natural talent was low.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Anonymous? I am famous?”</span></p>
 <p><span>The Red Knights believed that the Saharan Empire was the whole world.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid was well aware that they were frogs in a well and stabbed Failure at Fulito’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span>"It won’t be so easy!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Fulito fired Super Sensitivity, which lasted for five seconds, avoided Failure and rushed to Grid’s side.&nbsp;</span><span>Using Super Sensitivity caused his brain to overload, so Fulito was already determined to die.</span></p>
 <p><span>'If I have to die, I will take you with me!’</span></p>
 <p><span>This was the last resort.&nbsp;</span><span>But by the time he reached his destination, the Doppelganger’s Greatsword was already flying.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid had predicted the behavior.&nbsp;</span><span>If the stabbing of a greatsword failed, how would the enemy respond?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I fought Randy who cloned Pagma over 80 times.’</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Puok!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>“T-This...!”</span></p>
 <p><span>"Goodbye, fake knight.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Piaro and Asmophel.&nbsp;</span><span>Only Red Knights with their strength would be a threat to Grid. No, Piaro’s strength surpassed Grid.&nbsp;</span><span>Compared to them, Fulito was just shameful.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Kukuk...! You might be strong enough to win over Kamiyan and I! There are many Red Knights who I can’t be compared with! You can’t go against the single number knights!”</span></p>
 <p><span>"Stop speaking long words.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid didn’t exert his full skills in this battle.&nbsp;</span><span>There were still a lot of items and title effects that would be saved.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Damn bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Fulito still had one-third of his health left despite his heart being pierced.&nbsp;</span><span>He was secretly preparing a counterattack. He secretly gathered his aura while pulling Grid’s attention. &nbsp;</span><span>He was planning to inflict damage on Grid by exploding his aura and then link up his swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span>But Grid’s sword was faster than the aura explosion.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Where are you going?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid read the suspicious actions and successively swung Failure and the Doppelganger’s Greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span>The two greatswords crossed many times and Fulito’s health fell to the bottom.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid checked it and declared.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Bring it on, Pascal.’</span></p>
 <p><span>The price for aiming at Grid’s life would be repaid.&nbsp;</span><span>Then Grid smiled as many notification windows appeared in front of him.</span></p>
