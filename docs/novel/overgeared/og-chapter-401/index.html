 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[Fog Island haunts this island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had eagerly hoped to encounter Fog Island.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because he had a lot of challenger points stored that could be exchanged for goods.&nbsp;</span><span style>But why?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Why did it appear at this timing?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Flop.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid opened his mouth like a carp and sat down listlessly.&nbsp;</span><span style>He howled like a man who lost his country after seeing all the treasures disappearing in the fog.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Treasure...!! My treasure!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had to go through many trials to reach this 57th island.&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone on the 41st island, the golden crowns, the strong monsters in the 50s islands and the labyrinth he just passed.&nbsp;</span><span style>The degree of difficulty for the Behen Archipelago was atrocious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How good would it be if Fog Island had appeared in such a difficult area?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Then I wouldn’t have suffered so much...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The probability of missing a bonus stage like Treasure Island would’ve fallen dramatically.&nbsp;</span><span style>But reality was a gutter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Dammit!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid realized once again.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lady Luck had abandoned him.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was rare for there to be such an unlucky person in the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid kept weeping.&nbsp;</span><span style>If it was the Grid of the past, it would’ve taken him a considerable amount of time to escape from the shock.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now it was different. His spirit recovered fairly quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘...Still, the harder the island, the better the compensation.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Let’s take an extreme example.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What if Fog Island appeared on the 41st island?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid wouldn’t have met the clone and never had the chance to learn Linked Kill Wave and Pinnacle Kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yes, it’s good that it didn’t show up on the 40th island.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid developed his thinking skills and thought as positively as possible as he got up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s enough to get what I want.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wiped away his tears and walked through the thick fog.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then after a while, he saw a light.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the light emitted by the pumpkin-shaped carriage.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid identified the products on display as he approached the carriage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Pass on the hidden classes.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fog Island sold a total of 13 hidden classes.&nbsp;</span><span style>The rare classes ranged from 1,000~15,000 challenger points.&nbsp;</span><span style>Currently, Grid had accumulated 31,001 challenger points and could purchase any of the class change books.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they didn’t catch his attention.&nbsp;</span><span style>Since the emergence of the third advancement classes, the value of the rare hidden classes had fallen. There was no reason to invest points in it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Next are the skill books...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were a total of 46 skill books listed.&nbsp;</span><span style>The rating went from normal to unique.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, several unique rated active skills boasted outstanding abilities.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid was a legend.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had the legendary skills, so there was no reason to be obsessed with unique rated skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mastery skills were the exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Skill Book: Weapons Mastery]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Normal</span></p>
 <p><span style>Type: Passive</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Weapons Mastery skill is generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Price: 6,000 Challenger Points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weapons Mastery raised the power of every type of weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the highest mastery skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have to learn this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Weapons Mastery had its drawbacks. The increase in abilities was small compared to the mastery skills that were specific to one weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid didn’t care.&nbsp;</span><span style>Weapons Mastery was a skill with fantastic compatibility with Grid, who could use any weapon without restrictions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Live!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Over the past several months, he had worked hard collecting challenger points.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid consumed 6,000 challenger points without hesitation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Skill Book: Weapons Mastery has been acquired.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was delighted as he confirmed that the skill book had entered his inventory.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was happy that he got the skill he wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Learn it... Hrmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason Grid purchased the skill book wasn’t just to look at it.&nbsp;</span><span style>He planned to acquire it immediately without letting it stay in the inventory for too long.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he stopped moving as a skill book caught his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Magic Mastery!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Skill Book: Magic Mastery]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Normal</span></p>
 <p><span style>Type: Passive</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Magic Mastery skill is generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Price: 5,000 Challenger Points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ummm...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Magic Mastery?&nbsp;</span><span style>It increased magic power and shortened casting time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, Magic Mastery wasn’t the same as the Weapons Mastery skill that could be learned from a skill book.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was because it needed a magician class to learn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Originally, I would have no relation with this skill.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But thanks to the Behen Archipelago, he had a chance to enter a new realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can now learn magic from Braham through Assimilation...’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Learning Magic Mastery wouldn’t harm him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No, this is a skill that must be learned.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had low intelligence and couldn’t master Braham’s magic. He could only learn the lowest level of magic.&nbsp;</span><span style>But how could Braham’s magic be common?&nbsp;</span><span style>Magic Missile (Enhanced) and Magic Detection (Enhanced) had features that were incomparable to magic of the same type that ordinary magicians had.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had to unconditionally learn Magic Mastery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The price is too expensive.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It cost 5,000 challenger points.&nbsp;</span><span style>He could buy at least 20 elixirs with that.&nbsp;</span><span style>Braham’s magic might be powerful, but was it enough to give up 20 elixirs?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid worried about it for a while before deciding.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘...I will learn it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was looking into the future.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would keep levelling up and increasing intelligence. Then someday, he would be able to learn higher level magic from Braham.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid bought the Magic Mastery skill book.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The result.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Remaining Challenger Points: 20,001</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had over 30,000 points just a while ago, so he felt pained seeing it fall to 20,000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It isn’t in vain.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a skill book he purchased in order to become stronger.&nbsp;</span><span style>He shouldn’t be sorry.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid controlled his heart and finally looked at the list of elixirs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Strength Elixir]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Permanently increases strength by 10 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Price: 250 Challenger Points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Stamina Elixir]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Permanently increases stamina by 10 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Price: 250 Challenger Points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Agility Elixir]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Permanently increases agility by 10 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Price: 250 Challenger Points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Intelligence Elixir]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Permanently increases intelligence by 10 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Price: 250 Challenger Points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From a common sense of view, the most important stat for a blacksmith was stamina and then strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid didn’t buy elixirs for those two stats.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the first place, his strength and stamina were high enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Right now, I need agility.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro had a strength to agility ratio of 1:1 when he was a great swordsman.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid followed it in a desire to become stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Grid</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level: 306</span></p>
 <p><span style>Class: Pagma’s Descendant</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: One who Became a Legend</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: ...</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strength: 2,830 (+160)&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stamina: 1,306 (+230)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agility: 1,836 (+130) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Intelligence: 771 (+340)&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dexterity: 2,916 (+680)&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Persistence: 1,102 (+130)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Composure: 718 (+130) &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indomitable: 973 (+240)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dignity: 1,626 (+130)&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Insight: 1,466 (+130)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Courage: 662 (+130) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Demonic Magic Power: 102</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stat Points: 6</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I should use all the remaining points to buy agility elixirs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>20,000 points was at least 80 elixirs. It meant he could gain 800 agility at once, which was equal to 80 levels.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid pressed the purchase button under the agility elixir.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A consumable item. &nbsp;Please enter the number you want to purchase.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smiled with satisfaction at the notification window and was about to reply with ‘80’ when he stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘...Is this really right?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was before he fought the clone, Grid wouldn’t have hesitated.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now he was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>He could learn magic due to assimilating with Braham’s soul, and at the same time, he acquired Magic Mastery.&nbsp;</span><span style>Wasn’t it right to invest in intelligence in order to take advantage of this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Every time I level up, six points will be put in intelligence.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he gained 100 levels, he would only increase intelligence by 600 points.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was questionable if he could even learn Fire Ball before Braham’s soul left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yes, don’t be nervous and look at the future. I’m not tied to a legend. I will become a myth.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He should look at the forest, not the trees.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid took a deep breath as he recalled Lauel’s saying and opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will buy 40 agility elixirs and 40 intelligence elixirs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was being an all-rounder bad?&nbsp;</span><span style>Yes, a common all-rounder stunk. There were many people who weren’t strong or weak.&nbsp;</span><span style>But a legendary all-rounder was different. He would be an universal being.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t have any doubts as his eyes shone brighter than ever.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[You have learned Weapons Mastery.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Weapons Mastery Lv. 1]</span></p>
 <p><span style>* When a weapon is equipped, attack power will increase by 2% and attack speed by 1%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have learned Magic Mastery.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Magic Mastery Lv. 1]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Increases magic power by 3% and reduces casting time by 1%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have taken the agility elixir.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Agility has risen permanently by 400.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have taken the intelligence elixir.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Intelligence has risen permanently by 400.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gained 800 stat points and two mastery skills at once.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Grid was much stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s speed up the process.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was full of confidence as he moved through the gate to the 58th island.&nbsp;</span><span style>The 58th island was a time attack type hunting dungeon. Grid was able to clear it within the time limit due to his increased attack and magic power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the level of Weapons Mastery and Magic Mastery rose steadily.&nbsp;</span><span style>The level of the monsters was over 400, but the Mastery skills were only beginner level, so the increase in experience was bound to be large.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was thrilled with his growth.</span></p>
