 <p></p>
 <p>‘Grid will accept the deal.’</p>
 <p><span style>The value of elixirs were so high that Chris was convinced.&nbsp;</span><span style>Satisfy had all types of medicines, but the effect of the elixirs were unique among them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It can increase the stat by up to 10 points...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taking one was like gaining one level.&nbsp;</span><span style>How many people in the world could resist this?&nbsp;</span><span style>He could confidently declare that there were none.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, I will make you a weapon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid naturally accepted the deal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Please make me the best weapon. Like the blue greatsword that you are using."&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris earnestly asked again.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would cancel the deal if it wasn’t similar to Failure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Believe in me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid pledged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted to obtain the elixir, and he also felt honored.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Please make me the best weapon.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the first time he received an item commission from a non-guild member.&nbsp;</span><span style>He felt proud as the master of Overgeared and a legendary blacksmith. He had no intention of poorly carrying out the request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will add this to the Grid set.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Grid’s Boots, it was time to make a greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Failure, Dainsleif, the Doppelganger’s Greatsword, Lifael’s Spear, Iyarugt and so on.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s Greatsword would be created based on the best weapons that he had used in the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’ll add a special option.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s wily smile grew thicker.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"I can’t see the Tzedakah Guild members anywhere.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Are they hiding because they heard we were here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Five people were gathered in the garden of Reidan’s castle.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were the five captains of the Giant Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>They came with Grid to Reidan and were greatly disappointed.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Tzedakah Guild had been their enemies since the days of L.T.S. Now they couldn’t be seen anywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wanted to see Regas after such a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In particular, the 1st ranked magic swordsman, Mihara, was disappointed.&nbsp;</span><span style>He fought a total of 14 times with Regas, and the result was three draws and 11 losses.&nbsp;</span><span style>Today, he intended to add a win to this humiliating number, but couldn’t find Regas anywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We didn’t come here to fight. Please suppress your emotions and don’t make trouble.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the 1st ranked swordsman, Zirkan.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had lost his ranking to Ibellin for a while, but now he consolidated his first rank.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ibellin was promising as one of the 10 Rookies, but he didn’t have enough experience to go beyond Zirkan yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, sorry. I’ll restrain myself. I was just saying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mihara had a tendency to be wild and self-indulgent, but he always complied with Zirkan’s orders. The other captains were the same.&nbsp;</span><span style>Zirkan was Chris’ teacher, so it was hard to resist him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“By the way, this castle... There’s nothing to see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only woman, Pinky, changed topics.&nbsp;</span><span style>She thought that Reidan’s castle was ugly.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was large, but there were no gorgeous landscaping or decorations.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t just that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The population is small.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reidan was a big city, but there were no people on the streets.&nbsp;</span><span style>The difficulty of the desert was too high and accessibility was low.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The speed of Reidan’s development is much slower than our predictions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"In the first place, there aren’t even 30 members in Overgeared. They don’t have the ability to properly manage this big city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isn’t the farming doing well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It is a testament to their incompetence that such a big city was developed into an agricultural city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members were only good for fighting. The overall ability of the guild was low.&nbsp;</span><span style>The five captains of the Giant Guild thought so.&nbsp;</span><span style>They didn’t know that Overgeared had secretly absorbed the Silver Knights Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, there was a yellow mithril mine somewhere in the vast desert.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bairan was a small city in the north of the Eternal Kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style>Cork Island, which had a wealth of resources.&nbsp;</span><span style>What if the five captains found out that the current Overgeared members were divided between these three places?</span></p>
 <p><span style>They would be shocked by the power of Overgeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, I’m bored. I will be going for a walk, so please let me know when Master comes out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don’t cause any incidents.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Okay, I understand. Who do you think I am?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He laughed heartily at the Overgeared members.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to soothe his boredom, Mihara left the group and wandered around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wow, there really is nothing to see. How is this a duchy?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mihara was in the worst mood after finding out that Regas wasn’t here.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was someone who always pursued stimulation, so he didn’t welcome an ordinary situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The grumbling Mihara suddenly stopped walking. His gaze was fixed on the old fountain.&nbsp;</span><span style>A pretty NPC maid caught his eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is perfect for wasting time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mihara approached the maid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey, let me touch your body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unless they were NPCs that gave quests, users didn’t usually show any respect towards general NPCs. In particular, NPCs with a low status weren’t treated as people.&nbsp;</span><span style>Since humans always hurt each other, it was impossible to protect the rights of NPCs.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was one of the biggest problems with Satisfy, which guaranteed a high degree of freedom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kyaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The maid, pouring water on the flowers, was disgusted at the man who suddenly appeared and grabbed her ass.&nbsp;</span><span style>Mihara found her reaction funny.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What are you screaming about? Isn’t it just a small touch?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who are you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>A deep voice was heard in Mihara’s ear.&nbsp;</span><span style>Mihara moved his gaze.&nbsp;</span><span style>A middle-aged man could be seen.&nbsp;</span><span style>He held a hand plow and looked like a farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style>His name was Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was also an NPC like the maid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is an agricultural city, so there are farmers everywhere.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mihara angrily waved his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get lost.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I asked who you were.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rather than stepping back, Piaro asked again.&nbsp;</span><span style>Mihara no longer paid attention to him.&nbsp;</span><span style>He chose to keep touching the maid’s body rather than care about a farmer NPC.&nbsp;</span><span style>Mihara couldn’t imagine the disaster that this act would bring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"All of Reidan belongs to Duke Grid. Even the emperor of the Saharan Empire can’t covet anything here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro’s voice lowered even more.&nbsp;</span><span style>Mihara frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This bastard is talking nonsense. I am busy touching this maid’s... Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hand plow flew towards Mihara.&nbsp;</span><span style>Mihara’s level and and agility were lower, so he barely detected it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Mihara used Haste to evade the hand plow and seethed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How dare a farmer threaten me?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hwaruruk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Mihara pulled out a flaming sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this point, his judgment was blurred by the threat from the farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style>He tried to kill Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it was nothing from the viewpoint of Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is Reidan.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What...!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mihara was astonished.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because the farmer threw a small seed at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You trash.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Keook!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mihara was struck on the forehead with a seed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 9,150 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This doesn’t make sense...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is a place where a person like you isn’t allowed.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mihara shrieked.&nbsp;</span><span style>A seed flew again and struck his heart, causing him terrible suffering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'W-Will I be killed by a seed?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mihara checked his health gauge and thought this was a nightmare.&nbsp;</span><span style>The farmer threw seeds at the 1st ranked magic swordsman. It was a small seed like a sunflower seed, but he couldn’t be killed by this.&nbsp;</span><span style>But reality was relentless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have died.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mihara was hit in the forehead by a fourth seed and saw a grey world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I won’t touch an NPC’s butt again...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The NPC protection system had been strengthened so far!&nbsp;</span><span style>Mihara was logged out.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style> ***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation Skill]</span></p>
 <p><span style>You can create three equipment item production methods every time the skill level of the ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill’ goes up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number of items that can be created at present: 12/18.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* When items are produced using this skill, the name of the creator is automatically placed on the item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A long time after Grid’s Boots, Grid started to design an item.&nbsp;</span><span style>Prior to creating Grid’s Greatsword, he sketched a plan in his head.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was tremendous prudence compared to the days when he created items without any thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The worst thing about Failure is the excessive size.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A greatsword was cool when bigger.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the reason why Grid designed Failure to be 3m long, but he experienced discomfort after using it.&nbsp;</span><span style>It took too long to recover the sword, and it was greatly constrained by the terrain. In particular, it often hit the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A length of 1m and 40cm is the most suitable.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be better to increase the width by 4cm.&nbsp;</span><span style>One of the advantages of a greatsword was that it was suitable to use for defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Let’s increase the feeling of weight.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The biggest advantage of Failure was that it was made of blue orichalcum and was lightweight.&nbsp;</span><span style>The attack speed wasn’t decreased despite being a big sword, but its destructive power wasn’t maximized because it had no weight behind it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Then the materials will be a mix of blue orichalcum and black iron.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cutting power of the blade would be maximized by increasing the blue orichlacum content, while the weight of the blade would be increased due to the black iron.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had already closed his eyes for two areas as he drew out the shape of a new item.&nbsp;</span><span style>The young blacksmiths in the smithy couldn’t understand his behavior as Grid mediated to one side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is he only doing that after coming to work?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is he taking a nap?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What reason would he have for taking a nap? That is meditation. The duke is trying to figure out the type of weapon he will create before he begins.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Hoh.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Among the blacksmiths sharing their opinions, there was those with exceptional eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were the two young men who became intermediate blacksmiths first.&nbsp;</span><span style>Khan’s evaluation of them increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They are the children who will be a great force for Grid after me.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Khan was giving a break to all the blacksmiths.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to give them a chance to see Grid work.&nbsp;</span><span style>The young blacksmiths asked questions as they looked at Grid’s actions, allowing them to grow step by step.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Now, let's get started."</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the meditation, Grid used the Item Creation skill and designed Grid’s Greatsword. Then he finally pulled out his hammer.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The young blacksmiths of Reidan watched every move that the legendary blacksmith made.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>It was three days after Grid received the commission.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>It is completed.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Chris was hunting monsters in the desert when he finally received Grid’s whisper.&nbsp;</span><span style>He joyfully headed straight towards Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris was amazed as he received the details of the item created.&nbsp;</span><span style>The performance of the item was more than he expected.&nbsp;</span><span style>But his face stiffened after he checked the options.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* This item can only be repaired by the maker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This guy...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t he very sly, unlike the rumors of his stupidity?&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris didn’t know that Grid had grown steadily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it a deal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid laughed as he asked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris was very displeased. But the performance of the item was so desirable that he inevitably nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will... trade...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the moment the 3rd ranked user and head of the Giant Guild fell slave to the power of items.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now he became someone who couldn’t live without Grid.</span></p>
