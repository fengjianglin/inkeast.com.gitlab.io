 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style> "Jishuka, take the kids and come under me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment that Grid said so.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel winced and hurriedly sent him a whisper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Grid, what did you say just now?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>What’s wrong?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel spoke with frustration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Your way of talking is wrong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel knew that the Tzedakah Guild was a prestigious guild that existed since the days of L.T.S.&nbsp;</span><span style>The scale was small, but they had a tradition of at least six years. They had the pride of those who reigned at the top.&nbsp;</span><span style>But rather than respecting them, Grid told them to come under him?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was obvious that the proud guild members would be disappointed and repelled by Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>You should negotiate.</span></i> <i><span style>You have to respect them.</span></i> <i><span style>Then convince them to cooperate.</span></i> <i><span style>Do you think that if you speak to them like that, they will just follow you?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid noticed his mistake.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he thought about it from the position of the guild members, he realized that he made a huge mistake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Disgusting.’&nbsp;</span><span style>Was he any different from Lee Junho in his high school days, who made Grid his bread shuttle just because he was more powerful?&nbsp;</span><span style>‘In the first place, the words I chose were wrong.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But things had changed since entering the Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had many memories with his guild members. They got to know each other little by little. Grid recognized the guild members as friends or colleagues.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yet he told them to come under him, like they were servants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was very disappointed in himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How could I treat them like this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He controlled them with his items, so did he subconsciously perceive them as below him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am better than them. I also have high fame.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was he ignoring them?&nbsp;</span><span style>Just like the alumni ignored him in the past?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Dammit! Just a while ago in the National Competition, I realized that I fought for my companions!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s character had deepened and matured compared to the past. But that was only when compared to the past. His personality was still lacking.&nbsp;</span><span style>The evidence was that he was jealous of Noe’s popularity and posted malicious comments about him on the Internet.&nbsp;</span><span style>His nature was filled with self-righteousness and egotism due to his unfavorable environment, so he couldn’t mature in such a short amount of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'm sorry. I’ll correct what I just said.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>By default, Grid was someone who tried hard.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to his efforts, he could barely be middle of the pack at school, despite having no talents. In addition, he was able to become the first legendary class in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as he realized and corrected his mistakes, he would change quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will say it again. All of you, please join the guild that I will make. I want to continue to be with you, and I need your strength. I will also give you strength... Let’s join together to build a country. I consider you as friends and colleagues, so please.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid bowed deeply. His attitude was very polite.&nbsp;</span><span style>The stiff expressions of Jishuka and the guild members slowly released.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka spoke, “Give us time to talk about it.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"What should we do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid returned to Winston after causing a fuss.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Tzedakah Guild started to engage in an in-depth discussion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid is a necessary existence for us. Not just as a blacksmith, but also as a warrior. He’s a source of great strength. We can’t lose him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I agree with that part, but can Grid be the leader of a guild?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leadership was needed to lead an organization. In order to exert leadership, they needed charisma to force people or to make people loyal to them.&nbsp;</span><span style>But that ability wasn’t something that anyone could have.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why was the Tzedakah Guild operating on a small scale?&nbsp;</span><span style>There were many reasons, but the important one was that there was no leader in the guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>Those who acted to rise to the top possessed strong individualistic tendencies. None of them had the talent to lead others.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even Jishuka was limited to just commanding the current personnel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was stingy, filled with jealousy and only acted for money, so could he fulfill the role of a leader?&nbsp;</span><span style>Furthermore, he wanted to become a king?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was impossible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A clever person like Lauel can make up for the intelligence that Grid is lacking. But it is impossible for someone who isn’t a leader to maintain or expand the organization.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right. If Grid creates a guild, won’t it soon collapse?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A competent leader of a small guild was better than an incompetent one of a large guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>Everyone thought so.&nbsp;</span><span style>They judged that it was just Grid’s futile dream.&nbsp;</span><span style>But an unexpected person came up with a different opinion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid is a natural leader.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was this nonsense?&nbsp;</span><span style>Everyone’s eyes focused on one person.&nbsp;</span><span style>The person who received their interest.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Toban.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the Tzedakah Guild’s chief of staff, who became Grid’s slave in the past.&nbsp;</span><span style>At one time, he was reluctant about Grid, but now he appreciated Grid more than anyone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is required to be a leader? Isn’t it to unite and lead the organization, and ultimately develop the organization? Think about it. Grid has a power that can replace leadership.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Buzz buzz.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The guild members started murmuring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Power that can replace leadership?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it? I can’t figure it out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban gave a hint to the guild members who couldn’t understand.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Don’t overlook the fact that Satisfy is a game.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah...!”&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka and Pon noticed before anyone else.&nbsp;</span><span style>They shouted at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Items!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban was satisfied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right. When people play games, they have one basic desire. And Grid can meet those needs. As long as he makes items for the guild members, they will never betray him. And Grid will evolve while trying to do his best for the guild.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The main reason why the Tzedakah Guild was reluctant to lose Grid was due to his ability to make items.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>At least in Satisfy, Grid was fully qualified to be a leader.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If Grid produces items for the guild members with high achievements as a reward, the members won’t want to leave Grid forever. At the same time, they will gradually become elites.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Just like us...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the first place, a smart person like Lauel wouldn’t become Grid’s king maker if he didn’t have a reason.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel obviously planned to foster the strongest guild through Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The guild would become tremendously powerful through items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s lucky that Grid has Lauel.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Those were Jishuka’s words. She continued.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Thanks to Lauel, Grid will be able to reign at the top.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Pagma's Descendant was the strongest class in existence.&nbsp;</span><span style>But there were a total of nine legendary classes in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a blacksmith, Pagma's Descendant was relatively weak in combat compared to the other legendary classes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Grid kept playing the game in an individual manner, there would eventually come a day when he couldn’t surpass this limit and would have to concede the position of the best to someone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the story would change if he owned the strongest guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>The strongest guild that only Grid could create!&nbsp;</span><span style>This power would make Grid reign at the top!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why don’t we go under Grid? Anyway, we have reached the limitations of expanding our power.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I think so as well. I don’t want to watch Zibal or Chris’ guilds slowly swallow up this continent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Certainly... unlike L.T.S., there is a limit to what a small number of people can do in Satisfy. It would be better in the long run to be included in a bigger force.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I can never escape from Grid’s items. I unconditionally want to go under Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the guild members agreed.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was decided.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka stood up and declared,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Today, the Tzedakah Guild will be disbanded. The 21 members, including myself, will go under grid."</span></p>
 <p><span style>They dreamed of becoming the strongest, like they were in L.T.S.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to achieve those dreams, they chose Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to that, Grid swallowed up the strongest force for free.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an event that would go down in history.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The guild that represented the Eternal Kingdom was by far the Giant Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Tzedakah Guild was famous for its small number of elites, but that couldn’t compare to the Giant Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because the Giant Guild had more than 700 people.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a level that could deal with the Snake Guild, who was expanding its power in the Haken Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Golem army?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pedro City, in the southern part of the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris was stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style>More than 1,000 golems were advancing towards the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What type of magician can control over 1,000 golems? It isn’t possible, even if all the great magicians on the continent joined their power together. Isn’t this ridiculous?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The golems weren’t roaming a particular area. Rather, they were moving with a clear destination, so someone was obviously controlling the golem.&nbsp;</span><span style>One of the seven captains, Zirkan, responded to Chris with wide eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This information is definite. The golems are currently advancing towards the Eternal Kingdom, and it is likely that the south will be the first target, based on their movement path.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another of the seven captains, Asellas, spoke. “In the future, there will be a quest from the king of the Eternal Kingdom to defeat the golem army.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris smiled widely. “This is a good sign.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>So what if over 1,000 golems gathered? They were just slow masses of stones.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris was determined to defeat the golems in order to raise the guild’s reputation and increase their contribution to the kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is an opportunity to become an earl.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Chris was defeated by Regas in the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Giant Guild became confused. The loss of the guild master reduced the guild’s morale, and the guild seemed to be walking down a path of decline.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Chris was a person with outstanding charisma. He led the guild along with the seven captains, and the Giant Guild managed to escape its confusion. They boasted a stronger force than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris was confident.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We will be thoroughly prepared when the king’s quest arrives. First of all, tell the magicians to store AOE magic in their orbs, and distribute large weapons to the physical damage dealers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then after a few days.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a messenger from the capital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the name of the 13th king of the Eternal Kingdom, King Wiesbaden. Viscount Chris, slaughter the golems that dare advance towards my sacred kingdom!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Defense War]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Difficulty: S</span></p>
 <p><span style>Precisely 1,231 golems have crossed the border of the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Defend the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Conditions: Repel the golem army (0/1,231)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Rewards: One small city. 25,000 contribution to the kingdom. The guild level will rise by 1. Two million gold will be obtained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Failure: The golems will advance to the capital of the Eternal Kingdom. The kingdom will fall into chaos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were colossal rewards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris’ blood was boiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Zibal, you aren’t the first user who will become an earl. I will also be the first one to get 1,000 guild members!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris didn’t doubt it.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had experience with clearing guild quests with an A-grade difficulty, so he didn’t shrink back before the S-grade one.&nbsp;</span><span style>He just wanted to defeat the golems to achieve his goals.&nbsp;</span><span style>All the Giant Guild members, there wasn’t one person who thought this quest might fail.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three days later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Breaking news appeared around the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 A few days ago, golems gathered from all over the continent and advanced into the Eternal Kingdom. The Giant Guild acted to intercept them... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a tragedy.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Giant Guild could only defeat 300 golems.&nbsp;</span><span style>The southern part of the Eternal Kingdom was ravaged.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris was desperate as he looked at Pedro, swallowed up by a raging fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did this happen...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One year and six months ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chris became a viscount and gained Pedro, it had only been a small village when he first arrived.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past year and a half, Chris had developed it into a city.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was lost in an instant.&nbsp;</span><span style>All the buildings collapsed, while thousands of NPCs turned into grey light.&nbsp;</span><span style>The damage would be difficult to repair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris was frustrated, but he had no choice but to watch as the golems advanced to the capital.&nbsp;</span><span style>The true destination of the mighty golem army was the north of the Eternal Kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style>They planned to advanced from the south to the north through the capital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The great magician Braham did this just to draw Grid’s attention.</span></p>
