 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The 25th island was quite small and shabby.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was around 10 pyeong wide, and there were palm trees all over.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid looked Sticks down under the shade of a tree and prompted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey, if you want to live then tell me the elf’s recipe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh... Urgh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks was sweating and breathing in an uncomfortable manner. His state was so serious that it was hard for him to speak.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid hurriedly fed various potions to him, but they didn’t have any effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The helper fairy, Bini, trembled and made a fuss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Challenger! Please use your talents to save Sticks!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What should he do?&nbsp;</span><span style>The Grid in the past would’ve been confused about what to do.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he had greatly developed after meeting Kraugel and challenging the Behen Archipelago.&nbsp;</span><span style>He thought of a means to overcome the situation using his expanded thinking ability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Believe in me and wait."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid calmed Bini down and grabbed a sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Great Lord’s Sword]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a rare sword given only to the dukes of each kingdom, and greatly increased the insight, dignity and leadership of the wearer.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a superb artifact that allowed him to peek at the stats and skills of the target NPC through the Character Observation skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Sticks, if you want to live, give me a hint.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Character Observation has been used.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttiring~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Sticks</span></p>
 <p><span style>Age: 881 years old &nbsp;&nbsp;Gender: Male</span></p>
 <p><span style>Race: Elf &nbsp;&nbsp;Occupation: Sage</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: Wise Star</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Benevolent and wise. Has extensive knowledge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Isolated for a long time from the world. His knowledge is outdated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level: 401</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strength: 403 (▼) &nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 880 (▼)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agility: 1,201 (▼) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligence: 1,930 (▼)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wisdom: 2876 (▼) &nbsp;&nbsp;Charm: 2,490</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skills: Archery (B), Social Sciences (B▼), Engineering (B▼), Medicine (B▼), Humanities (B▼), Art (S), Magic Studies (S), Natural Sciences (S▼), Elementary Science (S+), Learning (SS), Education (SS).</span></p>
 <p><span style>A high elf with a noble lineage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, he should have a lifespan that is close to an eternal life. But in the process of protecting the world tree, he received the anger of the gourmet dragon Reiders and got a disease.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Currently in a state where his overall stats are declining.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The world tree existed in Elf Forest.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, Sticks was originally a person from Elf Forest.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why did he come to the Behen Archipelago?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid thought about this and turned to stare at Bini.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did Sticks come to the Behen Archipelago? Is it related to the disease from Reiders?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, that’s right! His original purpose for coming here was to treat his disease!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is there a medicine that grows only in this place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don’t know. After coming here, I only saw Sticks eating the blue coconut... Ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The means to treat the disease.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid turned his gaze towards the palm trees. The blue coconuts filled his field of view.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had the God Hands gather the coconuts and brought them to Sticks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Can you calm down if you eat this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks saw the blue coconuts and barely managed to open his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That... It if’s with the leaves of the world tree...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mix them together?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks nodded.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid cut the coconut shells while asking Bini.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are the leaves of the world tree?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'll find them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piece by piece.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bini searched inside Sticks’ robe. After a while, he pulled out some green leaves and handed them to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Leaves of the World Tree (6) have been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Leaves of the World Tree]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leaves that periodically fall from the world tree that defends nature. They don’t dry out even after hundreds of years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 0.1</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How many should I mix in?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks raised one finger at Grid’s question. Grid put one leaf into the coconut and mixed it well.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then something interesting happened.&nbsp;</span><span style>The transparent liquid inside the coconut turned emerald.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have succeeded in preparing the ‘Elf Miraculous Medicine’!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Recipe: Elf Miraculous Medicine has been acquired!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Elf Miraculous Medicine]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Recovers from all abnormal states immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The effects are exceptional, but the recipe is extremely simple. Anyone can make it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Recovers from all abnormal states immediately!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was truly a great medicine.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members wouldn’t have had such a hard time during the Elfin Stone raid if they had this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'But the question is how to secure a lot of leaves of the world tree and blue coconuts.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gulp gulp.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Was this like a person who had been thirsty for 10 years finally getting water?&nbsp;</span><span style>While Grid was thinking, Sticks was consuming the medicine.&nbsp;</span><span style>A notification window popped up in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The first aid for Sticks is successful!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[An elf will never forget your grace. Sticks sees you as a savior and will show your great affection in the future!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok... Heok... Thank you. Thanks to you, I was able to overcome a big crisis.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks got up and respectfully bowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am the high elf, Sticks. Can I ask for my benefactor’s name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks’s beauty was more brilliant than before after his color was restored. Despite being male, he was beautiful enough to compare to Yura and Jishuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid answered briefly and Sticks asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you Pagma's Descendant?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right. How did you know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks pulled out a transparent magic orb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I observed you through this and realized it along the way. Powerful swordsmanship, the ability to possess and utilize all types of artifacts. Also showing great blacksmithing... There’s only one person who comes to mind after all this is added up, Pagma.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid nodded and asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is the Contaminated Hall of Fame?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It refers to the current Behen Archipelago. The original name of the Behen Archipelago was the Hall of Fame.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The Hall of Fame?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A sacred place that celebrates the feats of legends...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stick’s golden eyes shone like jewels as he looked at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a place of succession where the power left by the former legends are transferred to the current legends. It’s fate that you came to this place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an unexpected and shocking answer.&nbsp;</span><span style>A notification window popped up in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A legendary class quest ‘Hall of Fame’ has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The legendary class quest ‘Hall of Fame’ has changed to ‘★Hidden Quest★ Contaminated Hall of Fame.’]</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members ranging from the former Tzedakah Guild members, Yura, Huroi, and Peak Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were growing rapidly.&nbsp;</span><span style>They repeated hunted in the vampire cities, causing their levels to rise and the rankings to shake every day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In particular, the vampire rings were a huge help.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unlike Grid, who steadily enjoyed the effect of Doran’s Ring and the Holy Light Armor, recovery items were desperately needed by ordinary users. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let’s move onto the next city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 10th city.&nbsp;</span><span style>Two months ago, Grid had encountered Braham’s soul.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members were no longer interested in a place where strong bosses didn’t appear.&nbsp;</span><span style>They wanted stronger enemies for even faster growth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Didn’t My Lord say not to widen the area because we might encounter a vampire called Marie Rose?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What if we don’t encounter Marie Rose, but an Elfin stone level boss? We don’t have God Grid this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi and Peak Sword were cautious and wanted to listen to Grid’s words.&nbsp;</span><span style>But who were Yura and the Tzedakah Guild members?&nbsp;</span><span style>They were people who always dreamed about reaching the top.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their basic ideals were very high.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Meeting a strong enemy is also an experience.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"So what if we die? It’s better to find good hunting grounds, even if we have to sacrifice ourselves, rather than become stagnant. Adventuring is the foundation of growth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And we have enough power to raid a Elfin Stone level boss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members were growing.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because they witnessed Grid mowing down Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>They praised Kraugel as the sky above the sky and regarded him as an insurmountable wall. Thus, they felt shame after Grid broke that wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why should they set limits on themselves?&nbsp;</span><span style>Why shouldn’t they experience setbacks?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s time for a new challenge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don’t worry too much if we meet a vampire stronger than Elfin Stone. This time, I’m with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka and Yura were sympathetic to those with the radical thoughts.&nbsp;</span><span style>The situation was like this, so Huroi and Peak Sword couldn’t say anything more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On this day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The vampire expedition led by Yura and Jishuka entered the 9th city.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>It had been 97 years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks, who came to the Behen Archipelago to collect the blue coconuts, was astonished.&nbsp;</span><span style>He admired the islands with beautiful scenery that were a monument to admire previous legends, as well as the sanctuaries with a mysterious atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then it was transformed by someone and filled with trials.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"In order for the current legends to become true legends, they need to inherit the forces left behind by the former legends. However, all types of trials interfered with the legends entering, so I have to sacrifice myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He waited for a hero, in order to tell them the importance of the Behen Archipelago and cleansing it together.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sticks waited and dreamt about that day.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have entered the 29th island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This is a save point. Do you want to save your position?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have been registered. When you enter the Behen Archipelago later on, you will start from the 29th island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid moved on while listening to Sticks’ long story.&nbsp;</span><span style>He smiled as he passed through the 29th island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will do my best so that your efforts aren’t in vain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid coveted many skills that Sticks had, especially the Learning and Education skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>What if he let Sticks educate the talents in Reidan, as well as his son?&nbsp;</span><span style>In short, it was the best.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was determined to obtain Sticks.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thus, he tried to show off his best side as much as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Believe in me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid confidently said as he stepped into the gate for the 30th island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have entered the 30th island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your level has dropped to level 1.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s eyes widened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is the reason why I couldn’t break through here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks belatedly sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is a very powerful curse. I can’t draw out all my strength.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid frowned.</span></p>
