 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"You deceived me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Randy, who copied Grid’s appearance, was beaten to death.&nbsp;</span><span style>Tiramet nervously threw down the slime-like creature.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Doppelganger Randy's health has fallen to 0.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Randy is forced to return to the pet inventory. You can’t summon it for the next 24 hours.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You will pay with your lives.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tiramet broke the ground as he leapt.&nbsp;</span><span style>The speed at which he reached Grid’s group, only Grid could react and cope.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura was too low in level and Sticks’ eyesight was low.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid blocked Tiramet’s fists with the combined Failure and Iyarugt and was pushed back two steps.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had a unique strength stat among users, yet he was pushed back by the force.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pakak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tiramet tilted her upper body and swung his fist at Grid’s temple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 9,975 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk...!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ku tang tang tang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid groaned as his body threw back against a wall.&nbsp;</span><span style>Tiramet’s basic attack was very difficult to deal with because it combined magic damage and physical damage, and also had changing features.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This isn’t good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was filled with extreme tension.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past, he might’ve fallen into a panic.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, it was a good opportunity for the current Grid to face strong opposition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Kraugel, you could’ve beaten this guy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wanted to prove that he was one step closer to Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid rose with this thought. Then he immediately rushed towards Tiramet.&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite being wounded, his momentum didn’t die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiramet yelled as he received a nasty cut from Grid’s Greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t that he couldn’t avoid it, but that he didn’t.&nbsp;</span><span style>Tiramet grasped Grid’s face with a large hand.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment his fangs shone in a threatening manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Magic Missile."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A white flash aimed accurately between Tiramet’s two eyes, while the God Hands grabbed the shaking Tiramet.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the same time, blood rose from Tiramet’s neck.&nbsp;</span><span style>Tirament got a headache.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How is he maintaining his concentration?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>His first attacks were in vain and now he was overwhelmed in battle, so why didn’t he feel despair?&nbsp;</span><span style>This person had a different mentality from ordinary humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘So far, all the humans have felt despair and frustration after realizing that I’m an immortal being.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiramet didn’t like it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Tiramet’s eyes shone red as he used magic to drive Grid on the defensive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Meanwhile, Yura was trying to grasp the function of the item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Alex’s Magic Engineering Gun]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 215/215</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Pistol Mode</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attack Power: 419</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mana Purification Rate: +30%</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Rifle Mode</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attack Power: 914</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mana Purification Rate: -20%</span></p>
 <p><span style>Firing Speed: -50%</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Bayonet Mode</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attack Power: 705</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attack Speed: +10%</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stabbing Attack: +30%</span></p>
 <p><span style>* It is only possible to change modes once every 5 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A magic weapon made by the dwarven craftsman Milepeu, who taught Pagma before he became a legend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Contains the essence of dwarf technology.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Conditions of Use: Demon Slayer</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s great.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The magic guns used by Yura only supported pistol mode.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, it was lacking when it came to attack power, and didn’t have the option to increase the speed at which mana was purified into bullets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks smiled as she checked Alex’s magic gun and shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I have watched you closely. This gun can bring out your true strength.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura had a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you giving me this gun without any conditions? Today is the first time we’ve met.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You are Grid’s colleague.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, a Demon Slayer had to visit the Behen Archipelago and reach the 25th island to obtain Alex’s magic gun.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a type of hidden quest.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Yura skipped the intermediate process and got a reward just because she was Grid’s colleague.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It was you.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaeeeeeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was having a bloody fight with Tiramet.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura’s eyes further deepened as she looked at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He is a man like a fishnet.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn’t escape from him.&nbsp;</span><span style>She never imagined that she would be so dependent on someone.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura aimed at Tiramet’s head and made a subtle smile.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wiing- click.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[Alex's gun will switch to rifle mode.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blue barrel stretched out and Yura’s mana was transferred into the gun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Extinction."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks’ eyes shone as he watched Yura from the side.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because the speed at which she refined mana into a bullet reminded him of Alex.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, he wouldn’t be surprised if she was faster.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiramet’s face half exploded while he was busy dealing with Grid and the God Hands. Blood and flesh dripped down and his skull was revealed.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an accurate shooting skill and great power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiramet struggled with the pain.&nbsp;</span><span style>His hate-filled eyes gazed at Yura and Grid didn’t miss this opportunity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Linked Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s greatsword accurately hit Tiramet’s half-face.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Tiramet couldn’t even scream.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s greatsword kept targeting Tiramet’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unfortunately, two of them missed, but four strikes were successful.&nbsp;</span><span style>A critical popped up all four times, and the effect of the Holy Light Gloves was activated three times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had the momentum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Link!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Link has risen to level 6.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The power of Link will rise.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pit!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pipipipipit!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaeeeeeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tiramet was amazed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite the deadly injury, most of the swift sword strikes were blocked with both arms.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now his opponent wasn’t just Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Focusing on Grid once again revealed a gap to Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Vindictive Sword.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Shaaaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She used Extinction Bullet to approach Tiramet and then used an aura sword attack.&nbsp;</span><span style>The white flash in a straight line once again caused great damage to Tiramet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was amazed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is very strong.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Demon Slayer.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a great demonstration of the passive and active skills that dealt additional damage to the demonkin.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura’s level, stats and items were far below Grid’s, but she dealt 1.5 times more damage to Tiramet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiramet was confused.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was absurd that one of Beriache’s nine direct descendants was on the defensive from two humans.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a shock that was comparable to when he met Alex, 150 years ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘First retreat...’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tiramet’s body scattered into smoke as he forgot about his pride.&nbsp;</span><span style>He planned to retreat, but Grid and Yura didn’t allow him to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Wave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Wave has risen to level 5.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The power of Wave will rise.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Waves spread in all directions, slowing down Tiramet’s speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Light of the End.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yura caused a golden explosion that shook the space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This... W-what is this...? Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The overwhelming regenerative power of Tiramet was neutralized by the Demon Slayer.&nbsp;</span><span style>Tiramet started to disappear without recovering from his fatal injuries.&nbsp;</span><span style>His screams echoed in the area as he faded away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Vampire Viscount Tiramet is forced to sleep after exhausting all his powers.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[1,325,810,470 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Tiremet’s Belt has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Tiremet’s Shoulderguards has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Tiremet’s strength is engraved on the Rune of Darkness.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The blacksmith who became a legend can appraise items with an excellent discerning eye. If a hidden feature exists in the target item, it will be found.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Tiramet’s Shoulderguards]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style>Defense: 95 &nbsp;&nbsp;Health: +3,000</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a low chance of nullifying physical attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is the favourite shoulderguards of the vampire viscount, Tiramet. Gives the wearer a high survival capacity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>User Restriction: Level 320 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 190</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Tiramet's Belt]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Epic (Growth)</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Reduce damage received by 10%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Stamina +100.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A belt that contains the unique magic power of Vampire Viscount Tiramet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 13</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This item has a hidden function.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The information about Tiramet's Belt has been updated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>* If this belt grows to a legendary rating, the wearer can summon Vampire Viscount Tiramet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Hah...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone’s ring could summon Elfin Stone and Tiramet’s Belt could summon Tiramet.&nbsp;</span><span style>Assuming that all items with the unique mana was like this, it seemed that summoning the vampires would make them his subordinates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is a big hit.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thought of having big bosses like Elfin Stone and Tiramet as subordinates in the future was electrifying.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura approached Grid and reached out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Please.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wanted the items to be distributed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid interpreted it that way and handed Tiramet’s Belt to Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is a bit disappointing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wouldn’t have been able to raid Tiramet without Yura’s help. In addition, Yura’s growth was Overgeared’s growth, so it was natural and reasonable to distribute the items to her.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Yura didn’t take Tiramet’s belt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Not the items.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Then what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid felt puzzled, while Yura blushed and avoided his gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hold my hand. As a token for my efforts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura asked shyly.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was bewildered, but he shook her hand vigorously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks shook his head.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Mama! Ma!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord’s sense of balance increased day by day and he started walking a week ago. He didn’t fall until he reached his mother Irene.&nbsp;</span><span style>Irene was thrilled and hugged Lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My son, you are the spitting image of your great father.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ruby, who was staring at Lord from the side, was embarrassed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her brother was someone who wore diapers until he was 5 years old. It was ridiculous that he would be compared to the super genius Lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But sometimes it was good for the truth to be buried.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ruby remained silent.</span></p>
