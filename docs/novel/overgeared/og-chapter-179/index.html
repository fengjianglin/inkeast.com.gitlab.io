 <p><span style>Chapter 179</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Players were aware of other players.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent was aware that there were six people stronger than him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Those six were the 1st ranked Kraugel, 2nd ranked Zibal, 3rd ranked Chris, 7th ranked Agnus, 11th ranked Bondre, and 14th ranked Hao.&nbsp;</span><span style>Except for them, there were no players who could beat Hurent in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'And I will soon go beyond those six people.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was the only one.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was his goal.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would eventually get the results he intended.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Class: Aura Master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Weapons are meaningless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*You can control ‘Aura.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The minimum qualifications to become a sword saint have been achieved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title - Sword Saint Candidate - Stage 1 (Transcendent)</span></p>
 <p><span style>* All stats will become 1.3 times greater.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Quickly detect the target’s weakness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a high probability of predicting the target’s movements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* ‘Super Sensitivity’ will be opened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Aura]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Epic (Red)</span></p>
 <p><span style>A type of energy that can be controlled. Aura is infinite and always present.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shape, size and characteristics will depend on the caster’s inclination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The color of the aura will change according to the rating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The higher the rating, the higher the effectiveness of the aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The higher the rating, the greater the size of the aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Aura can’t be separated from the caster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* You can raise the aura rating through training.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Super Sensitivity Lv. 1 (36.4%)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>All senses will become transcended.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lv. 1 - Telepathy: You can predict 100% of all your target’s behavior within 10m.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* This effect will last for six seconds and will continue for two seconds after the effect has ended.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Mana consumption: All of your current mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: 1 hour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You aren’t my opponent.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was able to see all of his target’s movements, despite only being at a beginner level.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pagma?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How stupid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to legend, Pagma was the strongest swordsman.&nbsp;</span><span style>But that was only when Muller was absent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pagma was named the strongest swordsman after Muller’s death.&nbsp;</span><span style>Wasn’t Pagma a blacksmith in the first place?&nbsp;</span><span style>How could a blacksmith who swung his sword as a hobby compare to a sword saint?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Pagma’s Descendant is insignificant compared to a sword saint.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent manifested aura at his fingertips. Then he released it at a huge tree exactly 5m ahead of him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The giant tree was cut as soon as the aura touched it.&nbsp;</span><span style>It dealt 4,600 fixed damage, could be released up to 5m, and the shape could freely transform.&nbsp;</span><span style>He also had ‘Super Sensitivity,’ which allowed him to sense the enemy’s movements.&nbsp;</span><span style>It could be said that this was his strongest skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aura Master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The weakness was that he didn’t have powerful attack skills, but that weakness could be overcome by raising his aura rating.&nbsp;</span><span style>No matter how he looked at it, Aura Master was a perfect combat class.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t possible to compare it to Pagma's Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“30 seconds...? Hahat~!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was arrogant just because he had the first legendary class.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent laughed as he recalled Grid’s 30 second logout remark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Newbie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t know.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t understand his subject.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Prepare to be embarrassed~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The whole world would be paying attention to the PvP competition held in a while.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent was determined to shatter Grid in front of the millions of people watching.&nbsp;</span><span style>Legend?&nbsp;</span><span style>He wouldn’t even give Grid a chance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was nothing.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this moment, Hurent was only wary of Chris and Bondre, who were on the list of PvP participants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will go beyond those two people today.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent wasn’t even looking at Grid.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>He just had a friendly co-worker relationship with Yura and Jishuka right?&nbsp;</span><span style>Where did he go with the drunken women two days ago?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reporters flocked like vultures and bombarded Youngwoo with questions.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo barely managed to escape them and sighed as he reached the waiting room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wow, why are they so terrible? I thought I was going to die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn't a joke.&nbsp;</span><span style>Among the reporters, the male ones looked like they wanted to commit murder.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura and Jishuka. They cursed and hated Youngwoo for having a scandal with both of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura handed a tournament table to the pale Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are a total of 32 PvP participants. The matches were drawn through a fair lottery.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The number of participants is surprisingly small.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s because individuals are limited to three events. The players prioritize events where they can get gold medals, so the 32 players participating in the PvP are all renowned top rankers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo looked at the table.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he found his ID and was surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Is this really true?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura replied with a worried expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Honestly, I’m really surprised. It’s a match between you and Hurent in the round of 32. It’s also the opening match. Who would’ve imagined?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The big match of the PvP was the confrontation between Grid and Hurent.&nbsp;</span><span style>People around the world were only paying attention to the confrontation between the two. They wondered how big the match would be.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The public became boisterous.&nbsp;</span><span style>The round with 32 participants.&nbsp;</span><span style>It seemed like a miracle that the confrontation between Grid and Hurent was the opening match.&nbsp;</span><span style>The confrontation was now right around the corner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who would be the winner?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid, who said he would logout his opponent in 30 seconds? Or would he be disgraced?&nbsp;</span><span style>Most Koreans wanted Grid to win, while the foreigners were predicting Grid’s defeat.&nbsp;</span><span style>The amount bet on the match was astronomical, and the dividend rate for Grid was really high.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurent! Hurent! Hurent!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid! Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurent! Hurent! Hurent!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The atmosphere of the stadium was remarkable.&nbsp;</span><span style>The voices cheering for Hurent were way louder than those cheering for Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Some people in the crowd were even booing Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura was worried that Grid’s morale would be lowered by the one-sided cheering.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Youngwoo wasn’t upset at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 The PvP competition will be held in 20 minutes. All participants should go to the capsule room. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of the guide was heard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo got up from his seat and reassured Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"First of all, I don’t have much experience with people cheering me on.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Conversely, he was familiar with mockery.&nbsp;</span><span style>"The cheering atmosphere has no effect on me. Hurent? I will shatter him in 30 seconds and win the gold medal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two days ago, Yura had been worried after seeing Hurent’s one sided treatment of Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>She thought the walls of the world were too high for Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style>But not anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style>She just trusted him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Take care.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The most beautiful smile was aimed at Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Pearl Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, it was an island used by the knight academy of the Bonkost Principality.&nbsp;</span><span style>The giant island that once flourished had now become deserted and desolate.&nbsp;</span><span style>The glory of the past couldn’t be found in the ‘Lion’s Castle’ standing at the center of the island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the facilities, including the walls, were destroyed, and the garden devastated.&nbsp;</span><span style>There seemed to be ghosts hiding behind the broken windows of the castle.&nbsp;</span><span style>The long forgotten place shrouded in spectacular views was shown on the massive screens set up in Olympic Station.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the stage of the duel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 The PvP tournament is heating up the last day of the National Competition! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Waaaaahhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hundreds of thousands of spectators cheered as the commentator shouted.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t just them. The viewers all over the world were excited as well.&nbsp;</span><span style>Who was the strongest person in the world?&nbsp;</span><span style>How brilliant was their control and skills?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel and Zibal might not be participating, but there would surely be plenty to see.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>It came!</span></i> <i><span style>Chicken and beer!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Two chickens.</span></i> <i><span style>If 32 people are participating, one chicken won’t be enough.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>If each match is 10 minutes, the PvP will last at least a few hours.</span></i> <i><span style>I have to binge drink today. </span></i><span style>ㅋ</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>It’s nonsense.</span></i> <i><span style>Grid will be knocked out in 30 seconds.</span></i> <i><span style>The match will finish before the chicken arrives.</span></i><span style> ㅇㄱㄹㅇ ㅂㅂㅂㄱ</span></p>
 <p><span style>-ㅇㅇㅇ </span><i><span style>Grid is scheduled to win.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>- Wow ㅋㅋ Do you really mean that?</span></i> <i><span style>You believe Grid’s bluff? </span></i><span style>;;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>He will logout Hurent in 30 seconds?</span></i> <i><span style>Crazyㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ He was defeated by Hurent in the target processing. ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Guys.</span></i> <i><span style>If you are South Korean, then you should support our fellow Korean.</span></i> <i><span style>Cheer for Grid-nim.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>That's right.</span></i> <i><span style>I am anti-Grid because of the matter with Yura and Jishuka.</span></i> <i><span style>But love is a separate, personal matter.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-Aye!</span></i> <i><span style>Don’t forget that Grid-nim gave our country a gold medal.</span></i> <i><span style>I am very thankful.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>No, what </span></i><span style>ㅡ_ㅡ^ </span><i><span style>a gold medal doesn’t matter.</span></i> <i><span style>What good is it for us if he wins a gold medal?</span></i> <i><span style>Why should we be thankful? ㅡ_ㅡㅋ</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-ㅋㅋ </span><i><span style>I shudder every time I see Grid being called a hero on TV.</span></i> <i><span style>How is he a hero just because he won one gold medal? ㅋㅋ</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Isn’t it natural to praise athletes who win a gold medal for their country?</span></i> <i><span style>Would you say such things about Olympic athletes?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Well anyway, Grid doesn’t matter.</span></i> <i><span style>In a few minutes, he’ll be logged out by Hurent.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>You scum...</span></i> <i><span style>I bet 4 million won on Grid...</span></i> <i><span style>My whole fortune...</span></i> <i><span style>Now I’m dying of tension.</span></i> <i><span style>I might shit out blood in the morning...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Oh my god ;; you bet on Grid? ㅋㅋㅋㅋ</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-Wow ㅋㅋ 4 million won on Grid? ㅋㅋㅋ Isn’t Hurent certain to win? ㅋㅋㅋ You’re just throwing your money into the trash.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>But the dividend rate is 3.2. If Grid wins, that 4 million won will triple.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-That only matters if he wins...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Even on the Korean internet sites, there weren’t many people who thought Grid would win.&nbsp;</span><span style>Surprisingly, many netizens thought that Grid would be the first to be eliminated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 The players are entering! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The broken Lion Castle.&nbsp;</span><span style>In a desolate garden, a black-haired Asian man and brown-haired Westerner appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the moment when Grid and Hurent met, after attracting worldwide attention for the last three days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As hundreds of millions of people watched, they finally clashed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Now I will announce the opening of the PvP match! It has started! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Waaahhhhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shouts of the crowd were vividly transmitted through the TV.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Will Grid win as the Korean people wish? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The commentator relayed in a loud voice.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo’s family gulped in front of the TV.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were earnestly praying for their son and brother to win.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style>No, Grid started his sword dance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh my~ you are using your slow paced skill again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent clicked his tongue and attacked Grid in the gap exposed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Syuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The golden blades flew to protect Grid, but Hurent’s ability to control aura was very delicate.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent was already aware of the presence of the golden blades and responded calmly, accurately avoiding the wall formed by the blades to hit Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 4,600 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Good, good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would trample on Grid step by step.&nbsp;</span><span style>He knew the skills Grid possessed.&nbsp;</span><span style>The range of Kill, Link and Wave wasn’t that far, so they wouldn’t be a threat as long as he kept an appropriate distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ranged skill Transcended Link was somewhat annoying, but it had a long cooldown time of at least 15 minutes. Hurent thought he would be able to withstand one bombardment if he focused his aura on defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Restraint.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a completely different skill that wasn’t shown in Bairan or the target processing event.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent paled as he realized it.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was astonished to see the notification window in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have been overwhelmed by the enemy’s spirit. Your actions are constrained for three seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is this...!?’</span></p>
