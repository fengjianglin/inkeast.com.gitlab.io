 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The smithy in Bairan Village was very good. Until Khan appeared, the blacksmith there was the best blacksmith in the north.&nbsp;</span><span style>But his disciple Smith wasn’t as talented.&nbsp;</span><span style>Smith was 66 this year.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had been working as a blacksmith for 50 years, but he was still a beginner blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh my, Mister Smith’s farm equipment breaks down so quickly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have to go to another village to buy farm equipment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Uncle Smith should’ve become a miner instead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, right. He is just as good with a pickaxe as a miner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He lived in the area for a few decades, but people still gossiped about him behind his back. Then what about the travellers?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Dammit, Bairan Village is good, but the blacksmith is rubbish. I can’t get anything decent from the smithy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The hunting grounds here are for high levels, but why is the blacksmith so inferior? Damn!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But isn’t he good at making Jaffa Arrows? The price is also cheap. They aren’t bad for a fight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not bad is the problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was like this almost every day for decades.&nbsp;</span><span style>Smith was blamed for being incompetent.&nbsp;</span><span style>No matter how hard he tried, it was useless. He reminded himself of his mentor’s teachings and repeatedly trained in controlling the fire and iron every day, but his abilities didn’t increase. It felt like a witch had cursed him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don't want to give up now...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every young man in the village dreamed of being a miner, but avoided becoming a blacksmith. So he had no disciples. Furthermore, he was old.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sooner or later, the lord would make him retire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smith wanted to become an intermediate blacksmith before then. He wanted to prove his worth.&nbsp;</span><span style>He lived all his life with iron, but he was going to die as a beginner blacksmith?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was obvious that people would scoff and laugh every time they saw his grave.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t want to be insulted even after death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Try to remember.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smith closed his eyes in front of the anvil.&nbsp;</span><span style>He recalled the young man a few months who he had briefly taught.&nbsp;</span><span style>The young man’s name was Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>His appearance was bad, but he managed to make the Special Jaffa Arrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How did he do it?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smith tried. He tried not to miss a single one of Grid’s movements when handling the fire and iron.&nbsp;</span><span style>Time flowed continuously. Before he knew it, the moon sank and it became dawn.&nbsp;</span><span style>The sky brightened.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Flash!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, Smith opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i> <i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There were no wasted movements.&nbsp;</span><span style>He handled the fire and minerals in a more orderly manner than before.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kaaang~!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Before he knew it, the sun had risen to the middle of the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Smith was in a trance. He didn’t feel the passing time or even hunger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t even realize that people were screaming outside the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style>With the fire and hammer, he just worked at smelting and tempering the mineral.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh...! Ohhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone spoke to him. Enlightenment suddenly came.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was true.&nbsp;</span><span style>Smith crossed the wall that had been blocking him for 50 years.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was so thrilled that tears poured out. He held the newly created ‘Special Jaffa Arrow’ and literally fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha...! Hahaha! I’m glad... I'm glad...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The aftereffect didn’t go away.&nbsp;</span><span style>Smith stroked the arrow like a cherished child as he kept crying.&nbsp;</span><span style>His last desperate effort had been rewarded.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the door of the smithy opened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Infidel, you will be judged.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone suddenly stormed into the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a believer of the Yatan Church.&nbsp;</span><span style>What was this?&nbsp;</span><span style>Smith questioned the sudden situation and looked outside through the open door of the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The village was filled with fire. The screams of people were constantly heard.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Smith grasped the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The Yatan Church has invaded...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ddubeok.</span></i> <i><span style>Ddubeok.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The follower slowly approached. Then he pointed his dagger at Smith.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die, Infidel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smith laughed heartily,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Haha... Yes. I can die. I already have no one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had finally overcome the limitations. If anyone found the arrow he left behind, they would know he was no longer a beginner blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Smith closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I can face Master.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt the eerie anticipating of the dagger approaching his heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There was a strange sound. A bloody mess spread quickly.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he didn’t feel any pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smith quietly opened his eyes. Then he witnessed the follower coughing up blood after being stabbed in the heart with an arrow.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a young man smiling from behind the follower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hasn’t it been a long time? Old Man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you here...?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The young man who gave him enlightenment appeared at this moment and saved his life?&nbsp;</span><span style>He thought he had no regrets about his life, but he couldn’t help feeling relieved.&nbsp;</span><span style>Tears poured down again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you been well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smith was thrilled and shook Grid’s hand.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a big hand filled with calluses. It was undoubtedly the hand of a blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid chuckled and pulled Smith to his feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Man, you made wonderful arrows.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His heart started pounding.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was recognized. It was his first time in 66 years. It wasn’t an ordinary person, but a great blacksmith!&nbsp;</span><span style>Smith rose all the way to an advanced blacksmith due to the enlightenment of one night.&nbsp;</span><span style>He could feel the greatness of Grid so he started sniffling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I can continue working for the next few years. Continue... I want to keep working...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid patted Smith’s shoulders.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Of course, you can work more. This is your prime.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Float.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid floated in the air and gazed into Smith’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Your workspace. I will protect it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your heart warms when you think about the old blacksmith who overcame his limits with commitment and a desire to work.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The quest ‘Blacksmith’s Affection’ has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Blacksmith’s Affection]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Difficulty: B </span></p>
 <p><span style>You are the successor of Pagma’s techniques and will! You have Pagma’s humanitarian ideology of using ‘blacksmithing to benefit other people.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The new dream of an old blacksmith who passed his limit has inspired you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You want to reward the old blacksmith whose heart is as hot as fire and solid as steel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Conditions: Protect Smith’s smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Rewards: The lifespan of Smith will be extended by 30 years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Smith is a late bloomer thanks to his effort. He has the qualities of a fine blacksmith. Extending his life will benefit you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Acceptance Reward: The skill ‘Blacksmith’s Affection’ will be created.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Failure: Smith’s life isn’t extended.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Blacksmith’s Affection]</span></p>
 <p><span style>If you have the maximum affinity with an NPC blacksmith, you can raise their skill level by 1~5 levels.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blacksmith who received your teachings will be loyal to you for life and will share with you every time they learn new item production methods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Quest is in progress.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first time he met Khan he Winston, he became angry in the same manner and learned the skill Blacksmith’s Rage.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had come to deliver armor to Vantner, only to witness Smith’s plight. Saving him gave Grid unexpected benefits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Maybe the world is different from what I thought.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought the world was a place where only selfish and bad guys received profits, while a good person was damaged. But his thoughts changed a bit after being rewarded for his good work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid felt better as he left the smithy. Then his high insight detected exactly 15 Yatan followers nearby.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid wore Malacus’ Cloak and let them approach, calculating the perfect timing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Wave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an absolute dignity.&nbsp;</span><span style>The energy waves from Failure instantly killed the 15 followers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The quest ‘Blacksmith’s Affection’ has been cleared.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Smith’s life will be extended by 30 years.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Good, good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid made a happy expression and turned his attention to the center of the village.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Tzedakah Guild were facing the old man Neberius playing the flute and the demonkin Balak, whose body was bubbling up like lava.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the guild members still seemed to be hanging on. Regas, Pon, Jishuka and Vantner weren’t present, but they seemed to be fighting well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Everyone is much stronger compared to the time of the Malacus raid. With their current power, won’t they just make fun of Malacus?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid turned his gaze to the other side.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka and Vantner were isolated in an area where the houses were concentrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This side is urgent.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Pant pant... Damn! You lousy bastards!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner’s health was at the bottom. The damage he suffered was so much that his potions cooldown time couldn’t keep up and he was on the verge of death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Die!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Divine punishment!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clever believers started to focus their attacks on Vantner.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, Jishuka made a decision.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She moved to defend Vantner’s side from the black knight’s attack, causing her to cough up blood.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner cried out,&nbsp;</span><span style>"What are you doing? I’m supposed to protect you, not you protect me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka ridiculed him.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Do you have the ability to protect me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the Tzedakah Guild quit L.T.S. and moved to Satisfy, Vantner made his character a tanker.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was a damage dealer in L.T.S. so the guild members expressed concern.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Vantner was stubborn. He wanted to be in charge of a different position from L.T.S, so he chose a guardian knight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he immediately regretted it.&nbsp;</span><span style>The tanker’s weak attack and slow hunting speed didn’t suit him. In order to level up properly, he always had to hunt with a party. The gap with his rival Pon grew bigger and Vantner became impatient.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tanker? No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to feel the pleasure of playing alone, Vantner started to put his stat points into strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>He forgot his original intentions of tanking for the guild members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How many times have I been told that a tanker doesn’t suit me? If Garcia had become our guild’s guardian knight as planned, we would’ve been stronger and more stable. I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner felt sorry towards Jishuka and apologized while bowing his head.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka smiled as Vantner was feeling depressed,&nbsp;</span><span style>"After this situation, distribute your stat points better in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Yes. After the Malacus raid, I have been distributing as much stat points as possible into stamina. I will now go unconditionally into stamina.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Okay."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka made a satisfied expression and pulled her bowstring back to the fullest. Then flames started appearing at the end of the arrowhead.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was poised to use the strongest attack skill, Phoenix Arrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jishuka?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was going to use all her mana to get rid of the black knights in front of them? Wasn’t it a death wish?&nbsp;</span><span style>The confused Vantner tried to stop her.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Jishuka had already made up her mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will wipe out all the enemies here. You should recover as quickly as possible and join the guild members.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka was 17th on the unified rankings. The rankings of the top players could fluctuate with just 1% of experience, so someone dying and losing 20% of their experience could drop the rankings down 20 places.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner couldn’t let her make the sacrifice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No! I will die instead!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka stared at the shouting Vantner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you an idiot? If you die then I won’t be able to escape by myself. Just listen to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 2,800 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 2,550 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have been cursed. Your defense is reduced by 30% and your movement speed has slowed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka was hit by magic attacks. But she didn’t protest.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hwaruruk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The flames at the arrowhead spread and the whole bow became covered with fire.&nbsp;</span><span style>The enemies would be wiped out the moment she let go of the bowstring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ohhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black warriors and magician sensed the danger and started their onslaught.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Papapat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A dart flew and protected Jishuka.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then a voice was heard from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop. Why are you planning on dying?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Paruru.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka blinked her long eyelashes.&nbsp;</span><span style>She didn’t hesitate to turn off the flames as she turned her gaze towards the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you so late? You bastard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was touched to tears.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was always sexy, but her puffed up cheeks made her look cute.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid flushed as his heart was attacked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'm sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner shouted while Grid was apologizing,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Hey! You bastard! Why did you log out while making my armor and where did you go? Isn’t this too much? I could’ve played a more active role if you made my armor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid threw him an armor.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Then start from now on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What do you want me to do from now on... Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner freaked out as he checked the information of the armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Relieved Wave Armor]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Legendary</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 574/574 &nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 861 &nbsp;&nbsp;Movement Speed: -4%</span></p>

 <p><span style>* Increases defense against cutting attacks by 30%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a high chance of invalidating cutting attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The skill ‘Persistence’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Among the items made by the great blacksmith ‘G,’ this is the second piece born with emotions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was left neglected during the production process and became anxious. Now it is relieved about being completed.&nbsp;</span><span style>It is filled with the desire not to be discarded twice, and that desire affects the wearer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It has bad feelings towards its creator, but isn’t petty enough to express it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>User Restriction: Level 240 or higher. More than 500 strength. Advanced Heavy Armor Mastery level 2 or higher.</span></p>

 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: 30 hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guardian knight had the invincible skill ‘Guardian’s Power’ that could stop an attack once.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he used it well, he could neutralize the enemy’s movements. Therefore, the guardian knight was a tanker.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the skill attached to an item was better than Guardian's Power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner’s eyes widened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There was a disadvantage that the cooldown is too long and it is difficult to use at the desired timing, but immediately recovering 20% of my health...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was truly a legendary item.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was thrilled as he shouted,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Grid! Thank you!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner took off his old armor and wore the new one.&nbsp;</span><span style>His defense rose sharply and 20% of his health was immediately restored. Once he became invincible, he stormed towards the black knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jishuka! Now I am strong! Hahaha! Strong! I will unconditionally attack and protect you!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A black knight’s sword flew towards Vantner’s back, but it was blocked by an invisible barrier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person who was dying had suddenly recovered, and what was this ability?&nbsp;</span><span style>The confused dark knights receded and Vantner started to run like a madman, swinging his twin axes.&nbsp;</span><span style>The enemies focused all their attention on Vantner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka was able to widen the distance and her powerful arrows flew without compromise.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk!</span></i> <i><span style>Puuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“K-Kieek...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two black knights instantly turned to light.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i> <i><span style>Kaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The surviving black knights attacked Vantner, but their swords often slipped off the wave pattern engraved on Vantner’s armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black magicians cast magic to stop Vantner, who was rampaging like a bull. But Jishuka was a problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She started sniping the black magicians, so there was no one to stop Vantner.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was already looking at another place,&nbsp;</span><span style>"You're next."</span></p>
