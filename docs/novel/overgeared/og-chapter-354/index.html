 <p><span style> [You have discovered a hidden feature in White Fang!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The information about White Fang has been updated.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttiring~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[+9 True White Fang]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Legendary</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 170/609 &nbsp;Attack Power: 1,015 + 539.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Attack speed will increase by 10 + 3%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Skill damage will increase by 15 + 7%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Ignores 25 + 15% of the target’s defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Slashing attacks will add an additional 20 + 10% damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* After succeeding in three combos, further damage will be dealt in the form of cutting damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The skill ‘Heart Selection’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The curse ‘Bunhelier’s Gaze’ will be applied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was produced by smelting the fang of the evil dragon Bunhelier, giving it the ultimate power. But it contains a curse. The owner will be followed by Bunhelier’s Gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The great demon Drasion sealed a portion of the sword’s power to avoid this gaze, but the legendary blacksmith Grid released the seal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 887</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Heart Selection]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Passive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When striking at the target’s heart (including both normal and skill attacks), there is a normal chance that double the damage will be dealt. There is also a low chance of instantly killing the opponent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Resources Consumed: None.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: None.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Bunhelier’s Gaze]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Curse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The evil dragon Bunhelier is always watching over you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You might be attacked on a day when Bunhelier is feeling grumpy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Activation Condition: random.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Information about ‘Bunhelier’s Fang’ used to make the item has been obtained!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The skill proficiency of (Understanding of Gods’ Weapons) Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill has increased by 10%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Amazing...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a persistent problem with legendary skills. Was it the long cooldown time and resource consumption? No, that was a secondary issue. It was basically very difficult to raise the level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the same for the Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had become Pagma's Descendant three years ago in Satisfy time.&nbsp;</span><span style>He invested a considerable amount of time and effort into making items, but was only able to raise the level of the Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill to seven.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It couldn’t be helped.&nbsp;</span><span style>After reaching level seven, his skill proficiency only increased by 1% when making unique items.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now, he gained 10% experience just from learning about a new mineral&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a dragon material. Grid felt like everything paid off. </span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Moreover, the results of the White Fang appraisal are also good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The attack power and durability increased by 100 and 200 respectively, and an additional option was added.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was thrilled with the performance, as he got some idea of what Iyarugt would be like if it grew to the legendary level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In particular, the skill Heart Selection would have a great synergy with Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel’s godly control skills meant he could freely take advantage of Heart Selection.&nbsp;</span><span style>But there was one thing Grid couldn’t accept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A cursed item?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s face stiffened as he read the item description until the end.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was good that White Fang’s performance was enhanced.&nbsp;</span><span style>But a curse?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the worst curse, to be surveilled and attacked by a dragon!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘...Crazy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like he had done something wrong.&nbsp;</span><span style>After the spar with Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid wanted to do a favor for him, but it turned out to be poison.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gulp.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What's going on?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel had an ominous feeling after seeing Grid’s color drain away and snatched White Fang. Then he stood like a petrified statue after checking the item information.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An awkward atmosphere flowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid and Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>The two men both remained silent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was the one to break the uncomfortable silence first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...I’m sorry. I am ashamed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was no longer shameless.&nbsp;</span><span style>He acknowledged his own mistakes and was ready to take responsibility for them.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was because he had to maintain his honor as Lord of Reidan, leader of Overgeared and father of Lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m really sorry. It wasn’t maliciously done. Give me time and I will return the item to its original state.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid apologized again.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel looked at White Fang quietly and spoke in a trembling voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh... Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Seeing the hidden abilities of an item and drawing them out, you truly are a legendary blacksmith. Among the two billion users, you’re the only one who can do this. It is truly amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel expressed his admiration.&nbsp;</span><span style>The peak of two billion users, how many users were able to impress the 1st ranked Kraugel?&nbsp;</span><span style>It would be enough to be counted on 10 fingers.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s ability was unique and great.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hwik.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hwiik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel wielded White Fang a few times and spoke to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel’s reaction was completely different from his expectations, making him confused.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel shrugged at the puzzled Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thanks to you, I can now own the best item.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t an exaggeration. Kraugel was sincerely happy.&nbsp;</span><span style>The True White Fang’s performance was enhanced.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, he was inspired by the Heart Selection skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will become two, no three times stronger than before.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel was confident that the Heart Selection skill would be his greatest weapon in the future.&nbsp;</span><span style>Striking the target’s heart?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was easy for him, since he had complete control over his movements.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid carefully asked the delighted Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That... Is it okay? There’s a curse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah, you were worried. You don’t have to worry about Bunhelier. I remember a verse from the folk song of the Trempet people, stating that ‘Evil dragon, a hero sealed it 500 years ago.’ It is highly unlikely that Bunhelier will appear at this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Where is Trempet?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>While ordinary users played the game by exploring Satisfy, Grid was a unique case who stayed in the Eternal Kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, he didn’t know the names of rural areas.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘And a verse from a folk song?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was insufficient in this regard.&nbsp;</span><span style>He played Satisfy and often missed minor parts.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel was the opposite.&nbsp;</span><span style>His senses were sharp and he was cautious about everything, so he didn’t miss anything trivial.&nbsp;</span><span style>The evidence was that he remembered the folk song of a remote village in a small kingdom called Trempet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So, what is the price I have to pay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wasn’t able to easily speak the price for repairing the True White Fang.&nbsp;</span><span style>The thing he most wanted was to obtain Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, it was to join Overgeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid couldn’t readily say this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t the reason why Kraugel was always alone, despite being ranked 1st for the past several years, because he wanted to do it himself?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had to take into consideration Kraugel’s tendency to dislike belonging to groups. It was proof that he grew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid thought about it for a while before opening his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Tell me how to get to the East Continent.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel’s mind became lighter.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had inflicted damage to the territory in his spar with Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had protected his experience.&nbsp;</span><span style>White Fang received an upgrade.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was thankful for the help, so he could relieve his burden by telling Grid the way to get to the East Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The value of this information was great.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was information that could only be completed if knowledge and information gathered around the continent for at least one year were aligned like puzzle pieces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is an archipelago in the sea south of the Sea Kingdom Media called Benhen. It is an archipelago made up of a total of 66 small islands.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid listened closely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel sent him a provocative look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There is a sage present somewhere called Sticks. If you find him, you will be able to move to the East Continent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I can find him? Are you saying that he’s hiding in a place that is hard to find?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Behen Archipelago is a very dangerous place. You have to cross 66 islands one after another. A few high rankers became frustrated and couldn’t even pass the 10th island. And Sticks usually lives on the 25~29th islands."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Media... Behen... Sticks...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t forget to take notes of the information obtained.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel was shaking with excitement as he watched Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What island can he reach?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Kraugel reached his limit at the 30th island.&nbsp;</span><span style>This island was believed to be the limit of the current users.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid was the one who beat him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Maybe he would be able to get something bigger from Sticks?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am looking forward to it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A person ridiculed as a dull-witted.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel hoped that despite all the trials, despair and frustration, Grid would grow up and inspire Kraugel to grow.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the true wish of Kraugel, who gained a precious rival.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is it so bustling?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid fully repaired Kraugel’s items.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was confused as he left the smithy with Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka, Lauel, Regas, Pon, Vantner, and the other members of Overgeared were all gathered in front of the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their eyes were staring at Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were hoping that Kraugel would join Overgeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh, um...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was perplexed.&nbsp;</span><span style>As leader of Overgeared, he had failed to meet their expectations.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid felt guilty and turned towards Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it? Do you want to have a meal with us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hrmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Grid’s liking towards Kraugel increased after the spar, Kraugel also liked Grid as well.&nbsp;</span><span style>He personally wanted to become friends with Grid. He believed that both of them could help each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was burdened by the attitude of the Overgeared members.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel slowly opened his mouth as he watched the Overgeared members, who were saying ‘be our friend’ with their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My mother suddenly called, so I should go. Log out.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suruk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The peak of two billion users.&nbsp;</span><span style>The sky above the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>The best.&nbsp;</span><span style>The absolute leader of the rankings, who monopolized all types of titles, Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was he an elementary school student, to use his mother as an excuse to log out?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a rather childish appearance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid and the Overgeared members thought it was absurd.</span></p>
