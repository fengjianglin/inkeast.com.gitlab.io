 <p><span style>Chapter 205</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>In this ‘Golem Army Invasion’ episode, the army of the Eternal Kingdom was helpless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only did 1,000 golems advance to the capital, but the hundreds of thousands of troops couldn’t eradicate them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the Internet, the netizens laughed at the fact that the Eternal Kingdom couldn’t do anything. They ridiculed King Wiesbaden and the nobles, stating that they were raising dogs instead of recruiting soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They don’t know.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Eternal Kingdom wasn’t weak. Rather, they were strong. The evidence was that the Eternal Kingdom had maintained its position of neutrality for many years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But this time, their opponents were too bad.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The golem army was unreasonably strong.&nbsp;</span><span style>In fact, the Giant Guild and 100,000 users weren’t able to compete with the golems.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Even I was barely able to destroy a soul doll, but the people of Grid’s group are monsters...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi, Lauel, Euphemina and Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid already had powerful users and he absorbed the Tzedakah Guild while the world was watching.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was obvious that Grid’s power would become stronger than the Giant Guild or Snake Guild in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Overgeared... Should I apply? My life will be set if I could join.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reinhardt was busy with recovery efforts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Can you help me?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I need a hand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldiers and residents gave quests to join the restoration work. However, the 304th ranked Happy ignored them and headed towards the royal palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There are more people than I thought.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thousands of users were gathered in a huge training ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were people who made great achievements in the ‘Fight the Golems’ quest. It was a small number considering that 100,000 users gathered in Reinhardt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The administrators gave them their rewards in turn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are the 16 member squad that destroyed an old golem? It was hard. I want to thank you on behalf of the kingdom. You will be awarded with 300 gold and 100 kingdom contribution.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>300 gold was worth 360,000 won. The users were quite satisfied. Sometimes, they looked with envy as a party that killed more than two old golems appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh! Sir Happy!”&nbsp;</span><span style>Once Happy’s turn came, the administrator was very enthusiastic.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Many soldiers and people witnessed you becoming active on the battlefield. You took on an old golem and soul doll alone? You will be awarded with 1,900 gold and 800 kingdom contribution. I am grateful for your defense of the kingdom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The users made a fuss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, amazing. He defeated an old golem and soul doll alone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"1,900 gold... I’m envious...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But isn’t Happy a ranker?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right. He’s in the 300s or 400s?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kyah~ as expected from a ranker.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Happy snorted at the users’ envious gazes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They shouldn’t be envious of me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Happy’s gaze turned towards the golden group in the distance.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this moment, the king was paying direct attention to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>How much would Grid’s group be rewarded?&nbsp;</span><span style>Happy was restless. He wanted to log out and watch the awards ceremony on TV.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘The legendary great magician...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid hadn’t thought that Braham was such a great person.&nbsp;</span><span style>A person who had already died for hundreds of years had moved golems that caused a kingdom to fall into crisis. Braham’s ability was mind-boggling.&nbsp;</span><span style>But why did he invade the Eternal Kingdom?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Whatever the reason, I don’t like it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to that damn crazy magician, Sehee and his father-in-law almost died.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid wanted to check what was contained in Braham’s Message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘However, I have to receive this first.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The brilliant golden awards ceremony.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Glory to Viscount Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Cheok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The soldiers saluted as soon as Grid’s party entered.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was unbelievable that they had just suffered from an invasion and lost family and friends. Grid was impressed by how strong their minds were.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I remember my days as a soldier.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s military service wasn’t good, but now he glorified those memories.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was proud of the soldiers who did their duty.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this moment, he felt a sense of gratitude to the Korean soldiers who were suffering to defend the country. It was sad that the world still wasn’t united.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Aren’t North Korean women pretty as well? I wish we could be unified.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Thump, thump.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid walked straight through with an upright posture. He had great physical strength and concentration due to his stats, so dignity radiated from him.&nbsp;</span><span style>The king seated on the throne and the nobles gulped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Indeed, this is the appearance of a legendary warrior. There are no chinks.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He has a deep look in his eyes. It’s like the ocean.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am envious of that firm waist and broad shoulders... I would be able to love more women if I had that body in my youth...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When armed with the Holy Light Crown, Grid’s dignity exceeded 850 points.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was a figure that surpassed those of the major nobles of one kingdom, so it had a tremendous effect. The nobles forgot that Grid was a commoner and gazed at him with envy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, once again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wiesbaden expressed his gratitude again from his throne.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t imagine that the cause of this incident was Grid, so he just considered Grid as his savior.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the important thing was that Grid also didn’t know he was the culprit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid showed a wait-and-see attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it wasn’t for you, this kingdom might’ve disappeared from history.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid currently had the upper hand. He judged that there was no need for him to show humility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I hope that Your Majesty will show me your sincerity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a rude comment to the king of a nation. If Grid was a normal person, the king would’ve been very unhappy and the nobles would’ve resented him.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid had high dignity and was the hero of the kingdom. No one questioned Grid’s words. To them, Grid just looked like a charming figure. Grid would be praised as manly even if he took off his pants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Earl Aden.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The king called the person in charge of finances. Then an old nobleman came forward and said,&nbsp;</span><span style>"First of all, I will reward the achievements of Baroness Jishuka and the other 21 people who joined the battlefield later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Tzedakah Guild stepped forward as they were called.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Aden conveyed King Wiesbaden’s will.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Baroness Jishuka and 21 others have saved Earl Steim and defended their kingdom, helping Viscount Grid defeat six of the ancient weapons. You will be awarded 20,000 gold and 10,000 kingdom contribution. In addition, they will be given the title of Viscount for their loyalty to their kingdom."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We are much obliged.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The compensation was as they expected. The Tzedakah Guild members were completely satisfied.&nbsp;</span><span style>The media were excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 The experts speculate that there should be 20 users who became nobles in Satisfy. Among them, the only viscounts are Grid, Zibal and Chris. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 But now, 22 more viscounts are born. In addition, all 22 people are Grid’s subordinates. They can appoint three knights each, so the result is that Grid has around 70 knights. This is a truly tremendous power. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The earl continued.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huroi, Lauel, Euphemina, Ruby and Sexy Schoolgirl. You joined forces with Grid to defeat 733 old golems, 187 soul dolls and 12 ancient weapons. If you hadn’t acted, this country would be in a great crisis. You will be honored as a hero of the kingdom, receive 442,900 gold and 184,800 kingdom contribution, as well as the title of Earl.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Numerous notification windows popped up in front of the five people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The title ‘Kingdom’s Hero’ has been obtained.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The title ‘First Earl’ has been obtained.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have become an earl of the Eternal Kingdom.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[In accordance with the laws of the Eternal Kingdom, an earl can have 10,000 soldiers and five knights, and can have up to three spouses. You will receive a monthly salary of 3,000 gold.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Kingdom's Hero]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hero who saved the Eternal Kingdom from a crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* All stats +120.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The highest reputation throughout the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[First Earl]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A user has become an earl for the first time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Dignity +200</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Charm +500.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* If you have more than 500 charm, people of both sexes will show great favor towards you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Earl...? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reporters of each broadcasting station were astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 It’s amazing. Didn’t the kingdom originally have a limit on the number of senior nobles? To appoint five earls in one day... 』&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 It means they are big enough to make the Eternal Kingdom endure the financial bleeding. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 If they are earls, then... Grid should become at least a marquis. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Grid is truly amazing. He’s writing a new legend every time. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 ... Sexy Schoolgirl didn’t do anything during the battle, but she was still counted? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 ... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>Five earls were born, and all of them were Grid’s subordinates.&nbsp;</span><span style>The world became frenzied at the breaking news.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi, Lauel and Euphemina were pleased at gaining more rewards than expected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Sehee and Yerim didn’t care.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is an earl good?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Perhaps?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is 442,900 gold a lot?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Well, I don’t know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel sighed as he looked at the two girls.&nbsp;</span><span style>People who were born with gold spoons couldn’t perceive how good they had it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I wish I had a brother or sister like Grid too...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Lauel was feeling jealousy, Grid was receiving his rewards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Viscount Grid, you led your knights and colleagues to defeat 733 old golems, 187 soul dolls and 12 ancient weapons. Your achievements can’t be denied. You will be praised as the country’s hero...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The next part will be a burden for Earl Aden.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Wiesbaden got up from the throne. Then he congratulated Grid instead of Earl Aden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Viscount Grid will be given 500,000 gold, an infinite amount of kingdom contribution and the large city Reidan. &nbsp;In addition, you will be awarded the title of duke and your statue will be set up in the Hall of Fame, keeping you alive to the next generation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The title ‘Kingdom’s Hero’ has been obtained.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The title ‘First Duke’ has been obtained.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have become a duke of the Eternal Kingdom.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Depending on the historical background of the continent, a duke has no limit on their expansion of power. The royal family won’t be able to openly bind you.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Please note that there will be repercussions if you expand your power to the extent that it infringes on the royal family’s authority.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[If a statue is made in the Hall of Fame, special effects will occur.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[First Duke]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A user has become a duke for the first time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Dignity +600</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Charm +800.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[As a prominent figure, your reputation across the continent has risen by 10,000.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I want you to pledge eternal loyalty to the royal family.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I, Grid...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was about to pledge to Wiesbaden when Lauel urgently sent him a whisper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Only swear allegiance to King Wiesbaden, not the royal family.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t understand. But he did as Lauel said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I, Grid, swear eternal loyalty to Your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some nobles frowned. In particular, the princes’ faces filled with anger.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, King Wiesbaden was over 70 years old and in a state of considerable decline. He didn’t find any issue with Grid’s remark and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On this day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>New articles praising Grid were spread all over the Internet. The number of fan cafes for Grid increased exponentially. But since the number of Noe’s fan clubs increased more, Grid was struck with a sense of defeat.</span></p>
