 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s baffling.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid.</span> <span style>He was a very special person for the Rebecca Church.</span> <span style>The hero who saved their church by punishing the corrupt Pope Drevigo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of the members praised Grid’s feat.</span> <span style>A big wave was unavoidable if he claimed to be Damian’s guardian.</span> <span style>Numerous members were likely to support Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘That Damian, he was preparing for his loss.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a deadly move.</span> <span style>The elders never imagined that such a foolish guy would call someone big like Grid to help him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s a crisis.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The election wasn’t the only method that Grid could help Damian.</span> <span style>By sealing Lifael’s Spear, it was possible to remove Damian’s weakness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Ah, this is a quandary.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike the elders, Pascal’s face was relaxed.</span> <span style>He had experience with Grid, and could turn this crisis into an opportunity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid isn’t a hero.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason why Grid defeated Drevigo.</span> <span style>It wasn’t for the Rebecca Church, but for Grid himself.</span> <span style>Pascal knew the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He said he killed Drevigo because he needed to bless the odd mineral called pavranium.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was selfish and violent.</span> <span style>At the time that the pavranium received God Judar’s blessing, Pascal had peeked at Grid’s nature.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The more selfish a person is, the easier it is to handle them.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why was Grid claiming to be Damian’s guardian?</span> <span style>It was because there was something good in it for him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ssik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal smiled widely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid, I can give more to you than Damian.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wealth, power, and beauty.</span> <span style>He would give Grid everything he wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘So leave Damian and come to me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he could get Grid on his side, he could unseal all three divine artifacts as well as win the election.</span> <span style>It was a great opportunity to become pope with the strongest Rebecca’s Daughters.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal had this thought and broke the uncomfortable silence.</span> <span style>“Hey hey! Who is this? The savior of the Rebecca Church! Hero among heroes! If it isn’t Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal exclaimed while smiling as brightly as possible. He praised Grid with exaggerated words and shook hands with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’m so glad to see you again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This guy, he can smile instead of feeling angry after my blatant provocation?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an unexpected response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He was like this in the past.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had taken the Holy Light set that Pascal wanted. But rather than being hostile to Grid, Pascal welcomed him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thanked Grid for punishing Drevigo, held a banquet and gave God Judar’s blessing without any conditions.</span> <span style>He was someone to watch out for. Pascal was someone reluctant to make strong enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to provoke him some more.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid thought this and responded to the handshake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nice to see you as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal’s spirit rose at Grid’s response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s like this. I don’t know about the other elders, but he shouldn’t be rude to me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid should also be aware of it.</span> <span style>The fact that Pascal would be more helpful than Damian.</span> <span style>Pascal was filled with confidence and quickly led the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re a duke of the Eternal Kingdom? You’re truly a hero. Your outstanding abilities have been recognized. Now, let’s move the location. I will prepare a reunion celebration banquet, so let’s talk to each other after a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian paled as he watched the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid and Pascal knew each other?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was serious.</span> <span style>Pascal was extremely rich. Grid could be tempted by money.</span> <span style>As Damian was worrying, Pascal nailed in the final wedge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sir Grid, I will prepare many gifts for you today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoh, gifts. i am looking forward to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid started to show interest.</span> <span style>Damian was frustrated, while Pascal showed a deep smile.</span> <span style>It was at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But Pascal, I’m a duke, right?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid gripped the hand he was shaking with more strength.</span> <span style>Pascal’s face rapidly twisted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is this...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an incredible grip.</span> <span style>Pascal started to feel pain in his hands. He struggled, but Grid didn’t let go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You aren’t a pope yet. A pope candidate is asking for a handshake instead of politely greeting me? You seem to be making fun of me, Pascal. Was it a lie when you praised me as a hero?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>'You’re just the duke of a small kingdom!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal was a noble of the Saharan Empire.</span> <span style>He recognized all nations apart from the empire as small, and thought they were barbaric.</span> <span style>He was a nationalist who believed that only the empire should be blessed by Goddess Rebecca.</span> <span style>For Pascal, there was no humiliation worse than being treated like this by &nbsp;a noble of a small kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this violence? Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal yelled, then became filled with consternation the moment he met Grid’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was unable to read the emotions or measure the depth in Grid’s eyes.</span> <span style>He didn’t know the intentions, but Grid had such profound eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s eyes were showing a clear meaning.</span> <span style>A provocation.</span> <span style>‘Bring it on Pascal. I want to destroy you.’</span> <span style>Grid’s eyes were clearly saying that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A beast!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment that Pascal was feeling agitated, someone fell from the ceiling.</span> <span style>A knight wearing red armor.</span> <span style>His name was Kamiyan.&nbsp;</span><span style>The 30th knight of the Red Knights, the emperor gave him to Pascal in the hope that Pascal would become the pope.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan warned with his sword at Grid’s neck.</span> <span style>Grid snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What if I don’t want to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will cut off your hand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan showed no hesitation.</span> <span style>His sword moved towards the hand that was holding Pascal’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal shouted, "Stop!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan’s sword stopped just above Grid’s wrist.</span> <span style>Grid’s eyes narrowed from where he had been able to summon Failure from the inventory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Too bad.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal barely managed to escape from Grid’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sir Grid, I will close my eyes to your rudeness today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t have to? I told you already. If you have a complaint then come forward. Bring it on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anger boiled inside Pascal’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was the son of a Saharan noble, who had gained a high status after joining the Rebecca Church. This was the first time that he had been treated like this.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal couldn’t be rational or prudent anymore. In his heart, he wanted to tell Kamiyan to immediately hit Grid’s neck.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he had to endure it.</span> <span style>He needed Grid’s strength to release the seals on the three divine artifacts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I hope that we can laugh with each other when we meet again soon. I will always have a gift for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal withdrew with a red face. Kamiyan and the elders followed him.</span> <span style>Grid’s face was filled with regret as he looked at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘His endurance is great.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid couldn’t attack senior NPC priests first.</span> <span style>As long as they weren’t abandoned by the goddess like Drevigo, they were always protected by the goddess.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>If he attacked them first, the goddess would curse him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Goddess’ Curse]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The unlucky stat will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The unlucky stat was vague since it wasn’t a status condition. Grid was reluctant to be cursed by the goddess.</span> <span style>That’s why he tried to provoke Pascal, but eventually failed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Well, don’t be nervous and just wait.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>From Pascal’s point of view, Grid was an eyesore.</span> <span style>He would eventually attack Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Pascal and the elders left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel, who had remained silent the whole time, approached Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It has been a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a dissatisfied voice.</span> <span style>It seemed like she had something to complain about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I hate you.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel was plagued with terrible pain because of Grid.</span> <span style>This situation happened because Grid forgot to seal Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'm sorry.”</span> <span style>Grid sincerely apologized.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel gritted her teeth at the sight of him.</span> <span style>"Why are you sorry? Are you apologizing for unsealing Lifael’s Spear? Don’t make me laugh. I was able to save my friends thanks to you releasing the seal. Thanks to you, the entire church was saved. So don’t apologize.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was grateful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Then why is she angry?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tears filled Isabel’s eyes while Grid was puzzled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You always do this. Why do you only show up when I’m in a desperate crisis? Like a prince on a white horse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel had a crush on Grid.</span> <span style>Her emotions were stimulated because she was saved just before falling to hell.</span> <span style>But Grid had already ignored her once.</span> <span style>It would be the same this time as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You won’t accept me anyway, so why are you acting like this…?”</span> <span style>Isabel whispered as she bowed her head.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her words didn’t reach Grid. The problem was that her voice was too small.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Her condition is strange. Indeed, she must be in a lot of pain.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid watched Isabel.</span> <span style>Her beautiful platinum hair was now close to grey and it wasn’t even shiny. Her lustrous red lips were pale and her skinny body looked like a mummy.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a bigger problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Her breasts have decreased in size.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the effect of losing weight.</span> <span style>Her original B cup breasts were now an A cup.</span> <span style>It was really a pity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-Where are you looking? Pervert!”</span> <span style>Isabel covered her chest with her arms and shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is there to look at?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is there to look at? What does that mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do I need to explain?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s okay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been a really long time since Isabel had been so energetic.</span> <span style>Damian watched her and Grid and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Isabel-chan, you have always missed Grid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hoped her heart would be communicated to Grid.</span> <span style>He truly was cheering her on.</span> <span style>Damian wasn’t a rival for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s natural for the heroine to be connected with the hero.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was just an extra. He was too incompetent, so he was satisfied just watching Rebecca’s Daughters from the side.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi approached Damian and whispered. "Don't worry. She doesn’t fit My Lord’s taste.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The beautiful Isabel-chan didn’t suit Grid’s taste?</span> <span style>It was upsetting.</span> <span style>Damian was making a subtle expression when Grid urged him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How long are we going to stand here? Guide me to a suitable place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was time to figure out how to create and seal Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
