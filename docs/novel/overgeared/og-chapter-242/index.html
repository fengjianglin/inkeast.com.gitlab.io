 <p><span style>Chapter 242</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style> "He’s particularly intense today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That means his opponent is strong. It is the first time I’ve seen anyone who can push Piaro like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But who is that person? This is the first time I’ve seen him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I think he’s Duke Grid’s new subordinate?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The wheat field was becoming more destroyed due to Piaro and the black-haired swordsman’s duel. It was already a 50m radius of destruction. It had returned to the time when it was still a wasteland.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But there was no sense of confusion or frustration in the expressions of the farmers watching the confrontation.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were used to this.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro often sparred with the Overgeared members, so it wasn’t just once or twice that the fields turned into a mess. &nbsp;Rabbit admonished him to shift places when fighting, but Piaro stood firm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he destroyed the field, then he would have more work to do. It was a bizarre logic, but the fields had officially been turned into a sparring ground. Piaro was a real labor addict.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Bland, isn’t that Piaro’s share?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was also a noble among the farmers. Bland was caught eating Piaro’s snack and cried out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why is this Piaro’s share? Piaro said he wouldn’t eat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don't know...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Uhuh! Piaro said it! Then the person who eats it first is the owner!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bland had completely adapted to the farmer’s life. It was hard to believe that he was a noble. He was covered in dirt and chewing on a potato. The farmers knew the circumstances of being taken hostage and felt compassion for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Bland was happy.&nbsp;</span><span style>He found these days 100 times more free and enjoyable than the time when he needed to be conscious of other people.</span></p>
 <p><em><span style>Caw~!</span></em></p>
 <p><span style>A roc flew in the sky. It had a large body and liked eating wheat.&nbsp;</span><span style>A couple of days ago, the monster had tried to loot the wheat field.&nbsp;</span><span style>But before it could reach the wheat field, it was hit in the sky. It was magic that Bland had strengthened through continuous duels with Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>Blood spilled out and the body of the monster fell to one side of Reidan’s wheat field.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This place was peaceful today. There were few places safer on the continent than this.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The power of Advanced Sword Mastery Level 7, his passive skill ‘Sword Reinforcement and the effect of various titles, including Sword Saint Candidate, overlapped with the power of Storm Sword and allowed him to cope with the Supreme Swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro laughed as the Storm Sword neutralized his strike.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Huhu, it was offset.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were few people who survived against Supreme Swordsmanship 1st style.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Kraugel defended against it. Piaro thought that Kraugel would at least get a serious injury.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘My condition isn’t very good right now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a great swordsman, he didn’t cling to weapons or armor. He didn’t feel the need to rely on tools.&nbsp;</span><span style>But at this moment, he felt regret about his tools.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he had been armed with a better sword, would the Supreme Swordsmanship 1st style be able to be blocked?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Shake shake.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro shook off his thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Muller wouldn’t blame his tools.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was laughable that a person aiming to be a sword saint would blame his tools.&nbsp;</span><span style>The purpose of this duel wasn’t a one-sided victory. It was something that would assist his growth. He should be happy if his opponent held on for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This technique is relentless.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The remnants of the Storm Sword persistently clung to Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro had to waste time to defeat these persistent fragments and Kraugel didn’t miss this gap. He used Mole Ascension.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>White Fang moved through the earth.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro also didn’t stay still. He responded with Supreme Swordsmanship, 5th style.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pachichik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Colorless energy unfolded around him like a spider web.&nbsp;</span><span style>It destroyed the remnants of the Storm Sword, while at the same time, neutralizing Mole Ascension and covering Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Nine.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel grasped the number of invisible energy. It was because of the power of Keen Senses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can’t block all of them.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel’s brain rotation speed was unmatched. He determined his actions quickly and protected his vital spots.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 8,830 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 9,200 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 9,050 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>'The damage is more than expected.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The legendary armor and artifacts that he gathered while raiding a lot of boss monsters weren’t much help.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro had a power that made defense useless.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel endured the pain and didn’t delay his next attack.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was his turn to take off some flesh and bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Moonrise Sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a skill that exerted its full power under the light of the full moon. But he was currently in a predicament and couldn’t afford to not use it.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moon moved behind the sun.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Susuk.</span></i> <i><span style>Sususuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel accelerated and activated the stealth function in the blazing sunlight. It was the effect of the white light, which utilized the refraction of light.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel had amazing control skills, so this technique was perfect in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Hah.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro had to concentrate in order to not miss the disappearing Kraugel. However, Kraugel wasn’t emitting any energy. As soon as he disappeared from view, Piaro couldn’t detect him.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the moment when the man who reached the peak of two billion users met the strongest swordsman on the continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro was tense.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the first time he sweated in a long time. White Fang penetrated through his qi defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 12,400 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The attack hit, but Kraugel’s expression wasn’t good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can only deal this much damage, despite attacking a person wearing no armor... I could only exert 30% of my power.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel was regretful about his attack. But he believed that he could change the flow with this. He went on the offensive against Piaro.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the power of Supreme Swordsmanship was scary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro’s sword started to intentionally harmonize with Kraugel’s blade.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel was forced back by the sword and forced to feel like he was caught in a large spider web. He couldn’t even unfold his swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Calm down. It doesn’t matter if his swordsmanship style is stronger than mine.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaduduk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel was aware of it.&nbsp;</span><span style>The world was wide and there were many monsters.&nbsp;</span><span style>He might be the strongest among users, but he knew that there were stronger monsters and NPCs that could trample on him. He was prepared to taste the bitter sense of defeat at any time.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he never dreamt that one day he would be defeated by a farmer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'No, it hasn’t been decided yet.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel tried to suppress his sense of defeat. Piaro used the Supreme Swordsmanship, 3rd style. It wasn’t a speed that could be followed with the eyes. A normal person wouldn’t have been able to cope and would’ve been pierced through the heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Kraugel was successful in responding. He instantly twisted White Fang.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he defended against the attack, Kraugel realized that he had made a mistake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Force palm?’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Qi was delivered through White Fang.&nbsp;</span><span style>Blood poured out from Kraugel’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 18,900 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>He lost half of his life.&nbsp;</span><span style>Fortunately, Piaro had discarded his sword. If it had been a sword then it wouldn’t have ended well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have half my mana left.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He needed to arrange his power.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel had many powerful sword skills such as Meteor Sword, Storm Sword and Moonrise.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Flash!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>One of the ultimate skills of a White Swordsman, White Light Sword, generated a brilliant light. Piaro was disappointed as he lost sight of him. A white light covered him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro felt a sense of crisis and shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Swordsmanship 4th Style!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Something terrific happened.&nbsp;</span><span style>White Fang, which should’ve pierced Piaro, was sucked towards something like a magnet. The momentum of White Light Sword naturally collapsed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kudududuk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro’s discarded sword attracted White Fang using a magnetic force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can’t resist this force...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The magnetic force was too strong, and control was useless.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were few options left for Kraugel. He couldn’t lose this weapon, so he was forced to use ‘Tearing the Sky.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Tearing the Sky was another one of the White Swordsman’s ultimate moves.&nbsp;</span><span style>It consumed a lot of mana, so it was a skill he was reluctant to use.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwajajak!</span></i> <i><span style>Kwajajajajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>White Fang was surrounded by the claws of a beast and started to resist the magnetic force, tearing it up.&nbsp;</span><span style>The skill proved why it was called Tearing the Sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The durability of the White Fang has decreased by 213.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is nonsense.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>His weapon’s durability had decreased by two-thirds at once. This was dangerous. He hadn’t been able to repair it for 10 days, so the low durability caused it to shine red. It might break if he kept on fighting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Even my mana is at the bottom. Meanwhile, my opponent is fine.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro only lost one-fifth of his health from the attack. Moreover, he seemed to have a lot of cards left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Should I just stick with it?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he bought the Sweet Candy from the Reputation Store, all his stats would increase by 30% for 10 minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style>It might be a 30% increase, but his overall combat strength would become approximately twice as high.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he opened up the ‘Super Sensitivity’ effect, he might be able equal Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No, maybe I can win.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But there was no need to take it that far.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There is no reason to take a loss in a fight where I have nothing to gain.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sweet Candy was something he used in the Drasion raid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Muller defeated Drasion, Hell Gao, Lepir, and Kurson, so there were 29 great demons left. He didn’t want to waste the candy that he reserved for use against dragon raids or the 29 great demons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Kraugel made a reasonable choice. He admitted defeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s my defeat."</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an absurd development.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He never imagined that he would be defeated in a city he stopped at to dispose of his loot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro shook hands with Kraugel and said.&nbsp;</span><span style>"It was a good fight."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why aren’t you killing me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel questioned, making Piaro click his tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not crazy. Why would I kill a person for no reason? You would’ve died if I wanted to kill you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had the skill Fated to Perish.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel couldn’t believe his ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You seemed to be filled with killing intent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro picked up the sword he threw to one side of the wheat field and apologized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wanted it to be a sincere fight. I'm sorry."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel asked a question.&nbsp;</span><span style>“What type of person is Duke Grid? Why is a strong person like you acting as a farmer in Reidan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was okay if Piaro was stronger than him. He knew that was reality.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, he couldn’t accept this strong person being someone else’s subordinate. Aside from the problem of pride, it was too dangerous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro frankly explained to Kraugel, who had a serious expression.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I'm not Duke Grid’s subordinate. I am doing field work as part of training, and I receive a reward for finding water.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Field work as training?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro made a proposal to the confused Kraugel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>“Why don’t you do it with me? Together, we will be able to quickly grow stronger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Together...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What were they going to do?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It can’t be.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel made an uneasy expression.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro pointed to Reidan’s fields.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Work in the morning, spar in the afternoon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You will really become stronger. Do you want to try it for a month?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>'It is different.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A notification window popped up in front of Kraugel, who was going to dismiss it as nonsense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A hidden quest has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The quest was amazing. If he practiced together with Piaro, he would be closer to becoming a sword saint.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A month isn’t a short amount of time, but...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was an opportunity to go beyond the wall. It was a different concept from simply raising his level, so it was worth investing time into. No, he couldn’t miss this. It was a once in a lifetime chance at a jackpot.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I understand. I will stay with you for the moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The quest has been accepted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>On this day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A good farmer was added to Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>But this was a minor thing, so it wasn’t reported to the higher ups.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was currently in the empire, while the Overgeared members weren’t present due to the mine development mission or raids.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid and the Overgeared members didn’t know that the first ranked user was growing the food they were going to eat.</span></p>
