 <p></p>
 <p><span style> “I...&nbsp;I forced Rin into this...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Vatican's backyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel was crying with her face buried in her knees.&nbsp;</span><span style>She felt guilty for dragging Rin here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I wanted to refuse His Holiness’s command...&nbsp;But I was afraid...&nbsp;I know how much Rin hates the current Vatican...&nbsp;It is because of me...&nbsp;Rin came back here because of me...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cassus tried to soothe her,&nbsp;</span><span style>"If you refused His Holiness’s order, Rin would’ve been brought back by another person.&nbsp;Rin will be grateful for being brought politely by a friend, rather than being dragged by someone else.&nbsp;So please don’t beat yourself up about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel slowly raised her head.&nbsp;She looked at him with moist eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>She carefully brushed her long platinum hair away from her eyes and asked gently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Rin...&nbsp;What will happen to her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pope had convened the high ranking members of the church in order to determine Rin’s fate.&nbsp;</span><span style>Isabel wanted to watch, but the pope didn’t give her permission, making her become more anxious.&nbsp;</span><span style>She didn’t want Rin to be treated unfairly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cassus couldn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Perhaps Rin will...&nbsp;She might be deprived of her qualifications, or in the worst case, she can lose her life.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the surface, Rebecca's Daughters were treated as sacred beings only second to the pope and received everyone’s respect.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the senior members of the church dismissed Rebecca’s Daughters as consumables, mere powerful weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style>As long as the three divine artifacts were preserved, Rebecca’s Daughters could be replaced at any time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Right now, Rebecca’s Daughters are people who serve the pope.&nbsp;They are a thorn in the eye of the current pope.&nbsp;The pope will want new Rebecca’s Daughters, who are unconditionally loyal.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pope would try to pass on the three divine artifacts to new people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Rin isn’t the only one in danger.&nbsp;Maybe sooner or later, Isabel...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cassus’ heart dropped.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rebecca’s Daughters were raised in the church.&nbsp;</span><span style>They only knew how to exist as enforcers of the church!</span></p>
 <p><span style>'... Once they become useless, they are deserted.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why was this terrible thing happening?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is a poor fate.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel was only 17 this year and Rin was 19.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were born with inherently high divine power and taught how to fight and be loyal to the church since childhood. If they were abandoned by the church, would they be able to adapt to ordinary life?&nbsp;</span><span style>It would be even more unfortunate if they were killed.&nbsp;It was too harsh for them to die without feeling the warmth of family, friends or even a lover.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Also...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once new Rebecca’s Daughters were born who were absolutely loyal to the pope, no one would be able to stop the pope for any longer.&nbsp;</span><span style>From then on, the Rebecca Church would walk the path of complete corruption.&nbsp;It was getting out of hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Someone...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cassus, who was usually stoic and expressionless, &nbsp;couldn’t hide what he was thinking.&nbsp;</span><span style>He shed tears for the first time in his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Someone, please...&nbsp;Save us...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cassus...?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Isabel was embarrassed by Cassus’ unusual appearance.&nbsp;She had no idea what to do.&nbsp;</span><span style>“W-Why are you crying all of a sudden?&nbsp;Huh?&nbsp;I-Is it because of me?&nbsp;Am I so depressed that I am making you cry?&nbsp;I’m sorry.&nbsp;I'm sorry so don’t cry.&nbsp;Everything is good. Rin will be okay, and someday Goddess Rebecca will lead His Holiness to the right path.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel was free-spirited.&nbsp;Despite being harshly raised by the church, she had a strong personality.&nbsp;There were many times when she made people tired, but she had a warm heart like sunshine.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was in the most difficult position, yet she was smiling and comforting her subordinates?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cassus became sadder at the thought of this sacred, beautiful and warm life ending.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment he was about to burst out sobbing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why is a big man crying?&nbsp;Eh?&nbsp;Especially in front of a girl.&nbsp;What a shame.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why was this voice familiar?&nbsp;</span><span style>Cassus was surprised by the emergence of an unexpected figure and hurriedly looked back.&nbsp;</span><span style>A black-haired young man was standing there with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It has been a long time, Cassus.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Winston Castle had asked for the support of a priest to make the Divine Shield, and Cassus had been dispatched.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the time, Cassus had bonded with Grid while two Divine Shields were produced.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he never dreamed that this relationship would continue again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why had Grid come to the Vatican?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why are you here...&nbsp;No?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cassus’ eyes widened in the middle of his question.&nbsp;It was due to the evil magic power and blood of virgins coming from the cloak that Grid was wearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That cloak...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel said,&nbsp;</span><span style>“That is Malacus’ Cloak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Malacus’ Cloak...&nbsp;Really?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel had several encounters with Malacus.&nbsp;It was because she raided several sites where Malacus was offering virgins as sacrifices.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was interrupted every time so she kept missing him, but she heard rumors that mighty soldiers of Winston destroyed Malacus.&nbsp;</span><span style>One of those mighty people seemed to be the young man called Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is an honor to meet such a great warrior.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah!&nbsp;You!”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid glanced at Isabel and was startled.&nbsp;Then he became excited as he recognized her.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Shield Thief!&nbsp;No, Shield Thief Girl!&nbsp;Ah, this...&nbsp;Ah!&nbsp;That's right!&nbsp;Was it Rebecca’s Daughter? Hey!&nbsp;Rebecca’s Daughter!&nbsp;Give me my shield!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel had encountered Grid at Winston Castle.&nbsp;But she didn’t remember Grid because she didn’t see Grid at the time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Cassus explained to Isabel who was puzzled by the nonsense.&nbsp;</span><span style>“He is the blacksmith of Winston.&nbsp;He is the creator of the Divine Shield that you are holding.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Omo, really?&nbsp;This young man has that type of blacksmith skill?&nbsp;Huh?&nbsp;But how can a blacksmith kill Malacus?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid strode towards the puzzled and admiring Isabel.&nbsp;Then he unabashedly demanded,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Give me my shield.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel was embarrassed.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I appreciate the fact that you defeated Malacus.&nbsp;But I can’t help you.&nbsp;The Divine Shield is a dangerous weapon so we have decided to recall all of them.&nbsp;That other shield that you made, could you please give it back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"W-What?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was dismayed.&nbsp;</span><span style>"How much money did I spend making these shields?&nbsp;Do you have any idea how great the value of the shield is?&nbsp;I can be rich if I sell it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand but...&nbsp;I’m sorry.&nbsp;It can’t be helped.&nbsp;The policy has already been set.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“D-Dammit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was grumpy at the thought of losing his legendary rated Divine Shield.&nbsp;</span><span style>How could he be calm when he was going to be robbed of items worth hundreds of millions of won?&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, Grid’s face turned red as he prepared to fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Blood won’t be shed if you give me the shield immediately.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was currently level 150.&nbsp;He was different compared to when the Divine Shield was stolen by the Yatan follower.&nbsp;</span><span style>His confidence was overflowing, despite facing the Rebecca Church’s strongest paladin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cassus tried to talk to him as Grid pulled out the greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Grid, please calm down.&nbsp;Let’s start with a conversation first.&nbsp;Why did you come here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, you!&nbsp;What are you saying?&nbsp;Do I seem like I want to talk right now?&nbsp;Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grid, please.&nbsp;Please calm down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cassus bowed deeply.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was reminded of the time he made the items with Cassus and somewhat calmed down.&nbsp;Then he explained,&nbsp;</span><span style>“I came to see the pope.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"His Holiness?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I have something that I want him to bless...&nbsp;I also wanted to ask for the Divine Shield back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cassus felt it was mysterious.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was amazing to reunite with someone who he thought was merely a passing relationship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is all Goddess Rebecca’s doing...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>What did his relationship with Grid mean?&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment that Cassus was deeply interested.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A powerful explosion rang out from inside the Vatican.&nbsp;</span><span style>Isabel’s face turned white.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This divine power...&nbsp;It is His Holiness!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Something had certainly happened to Rin.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was the pope doing something terrible to Rin while she stood here?&nbsp;</span><span style>Isabel was concerned about the worst situation and rushed towards the Vatican immediately.&nbsp;Cassus blocked her way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Didn’t His Holiness command you not to enter?&nbsp;Don’t go.&nbsp;If you break his command, His Holiness will punish you and Rin.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cassus was convinced that Rin was being punished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel gritted her teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Indeed...&nbsp;I have to save Rin from His Holiness!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A gold circle was drawn in the empty space.&nbsp;Then a white spear emerged from it.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was one of the three divine artifacts of the Rebecca Church, Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid observed the spear with admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I didn’t recognize it before, but isn’t this a huge weapon?&nbsp;It is much better than the Gale Spear that I made.&nbsp;No, it is a few dimensions above Dainsleif.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was only one person who could produce a weapon like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Pagma...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He found a clue to Pagma in a place like this.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid excitedly grabbed Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey!&nbsp;Let me see this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel became angrier at Grid’s actions and firmly waved her spear.&nbsp;He dared put his hand on a sacred weapon. She wanted to blow Grid’s body into a tree that was 100m away.&nbsp;</span><span style>However...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The spear wouldn’t swing freely.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because Grid’s strength as he grasped the spear was beyond the category of humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eek!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel wielded the spear with all her strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Grid’s body was thrown 30m and he rolled across the ground.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ku tang tang tang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid felt his vision blurring.&nbsp;He barely managed to get up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?&nbsp;What is with this girl’s strength?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid stopped putting points in intelligence after securing a certain amount of mana. Then he invested all his points into strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>At level 150 and combined with the effect of his titles, Grid had over 1,500 strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had the power to break rocks by swinging a fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s strength had grown to the level where Toon couldn’t compete anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yet this huge strength wasn’t a match against Isabel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Rebecca’s Daughters isn’t an empty name.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was a slender girl, but she exerted physical strength that was beyond the limits of humans!&nbsp;</span><span style>Isabel reached the front door of the Vatican while Grid was admiring her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isabel!&nbsp;Please stop!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Just wait a little longer, Rin, I will save you!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cassus couldn’t stop her.&nbsp;</span><span style>Isabel opened the doors to the Vatican, filled with the desire to save Rin.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A girl with purple hair descended from the roof of the Vatican and attacked Isabel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel was astonished as she barely managed to defend against the attack.&nbsp;</span><span style>The girl who suddenly appeared at the entrance of the Vatican!&nbsp;</span><span style>She was the last of Rebecca’s Daughters and the owner of Everiel’s Shield, Luna.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here...&nbsp;You can’t enter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel shouted at her,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Luna, get out of my way!&nbsp;Rin is in danger!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luna shook her head.&nbsp;</span><span style>“His Holiness’ commands are absolute...&nbsp;I have to follow them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really...&nbsp;You really can’t?&nbsp;It is a request.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel begged.&nbsp;But Luna was adamant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry...&nbsp;I can’t.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luna was much younger than Isabel and Rin.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was 14 years old this year so the brainwashing was still strong.&nbsp;Unlike Isabel and Rin who thought for themselves, she only obeyed orders.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was the one who had the most achievements when suppressing the rebellion three months ago, and she was the one most favored by the pope.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is impossible to break Everiel’s Shield...&nbsp;This can’t be...&nbsp;Rin...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel was well aware that she couldn’t persuade Luna and felt desperate.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this moment, Rin was suffering alone. Isabel</span><span style>&nbsp;was the only one who could help Rin, but why was the goddess giving her such trials?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Goddess, are you throwing Rin away...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment that Isabel felt despair... A</span><span style>&nbsp;notification window flashed in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Help the Rebecca Church!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Difficulty: Class quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Rebecca Church is a religion with deep ties to Pagma.&nbsp;The friendship between 5th Pope Franz and Pagma is still spoken about hundreds of years later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Pagma's Descendant, you are obliged to help the Rebecca Church that is being corrupted by 13th Pope Drevigo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kill Pope Drevigo!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Help the Rebecca Church!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Conditions: Drevigo’s death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Reward: Goddess Rebecca’s blessing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* This is a sub-quest that works in conjunction with the second class quest.&nbsp;If you fail this quest, you won’t meet the conditions to clear the second class quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are they crazy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Look at the warning window!&nbsp;If he failed this quest, he would fail his class quest!&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid couldn’t understand it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shit, what is this craziness?”&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a quest that caused him to tremble.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Ah, this is really...&nbsp;If I fail...&nbsp;Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was complaining when his gaze fell on the spear in Isabel’s hand.&nbsp;</span><span style>A transparent arrow, visible only to Grid’s eyes, was pointed at Isabel’s spear.</span></p>
