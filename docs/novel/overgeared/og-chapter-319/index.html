 <p><span style>Chapter 319</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘Piaro is at least level 400.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t even need to observe him with the Great Lord's Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was no other way to explain why his attacks didn’t do any damage despite Piaro wearing no armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘At least a 100 level difference...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The difference of 100 levels was big. It was a gap that couldn’t be filled. Apart from the level compensation system, the difference between the stat numbers and power of skills was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>Using common sense, the probability that Grid would beat Piaro was 0%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have a means of destroying common sense.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This meant...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Of course it’s items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the attraction of items that could destroy the balance of the system.&nbsp;</span><span style>For those who couldn’t afford it, items were a curse. But it was the opposite for Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would stand at the peak as an overgeared person.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Piaro was only using rare rated farming equipment and old clothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The odds are good enough.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid knew the strength of a legendary farmer. However, how could it compare to a sword saint?</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Piaro, I will break your stubbornness.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would make Piaro dream of becoming a sword saint again!&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid pledged and used the item disassembly skill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>After extracting the Water Clan King’s Tears from the four golden blades, he poured a total of 27 pavranium into the furnace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the beginning of the smelting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'What is he trying to make this time?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan and the young blacksmiths flocked to Grid’s side.&nbsp;</span><span style>They focused on Grid’s behavior and tried to figure out his intentions.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, they couldn’t understand Grid’s state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is he doing?’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid produced a mold while the pavranium melted.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the model of the mold wasn’t common.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t a blade or a spear, but Grid’s hand itself.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The pavranium expedition repeatedly attacked the 10~15th vampire cities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They wanted to challenge the cities that hadn’t been attacked yet, but they took Grid’s warning to heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There is a vampire duke called Marie Rose. Braham says she’s sleeping somewhere inside the cities. If we don’t want to be killed, only hunt in the places that we have secured. Yes? How old is she? Um... She is strong enough to wipe out all of the Overgeared members? This is a complete scam, a scam.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Many times stronger than Elfin Stone...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Perhaps a dragon class?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had succeeded in the Elfin Stone raid after reaching level 300.&nbsp;</span><span style>He recently became more and more suited to be called the strongest. They were also proud that the Overgeared members was the best guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>But this vampire had a presence that could overwhelm all of them alone?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, Satisfy was wide. There were many unknown areas and existences that hadn’t been met yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The elixirs are really dirty. Since the first day we came here with Grid, the number of vampires we hunted has surpassed 10,000. So why hasn’t even one elixir dropped?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I agree. If only one stamina elixir dropped...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is even the buff that increases item acquisition, so the drop rate is worse than rumored.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We still obtained 11 Junior Vampire Rings. That is big enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In cities where they had already raided the boss once, the appearance rate of the True Blood vampires dropped. The boss was also weaker than the first boss. This meant the difficulty of the dungeon fell, resulting in lower quality items dropped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members couldn’t make as much as they expected. But their attitudes were positive.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because the vampires gave a lot of experience.&nbsp;</span><span style>The vampire cities were still the best hunting grounds.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was phenomenal, causing the level 203 Yura to rise to 210 in just one week.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But why isn’t Grid here? There are only 25 days left on the experience buff.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He has something important to do, so he will come in two days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Important? He made a greatsword for Chris a few days ago, so what now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Perhaps Chris hit Grid in the back of the head?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That’s not it. He said that he’s making an item that is the peak of being overgeared."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Peak of overgeared...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Swords, spears, bows, etc.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were always discussed when talking about the peak of fighting.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the peak of being overgeared, they couldn’t understand what this meant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Did he find a way to do Item Combination without the merging time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...It might be possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Didn’t Pagma's Descendant have many abilities? In addition, couldn’t Grid take advantage of all of them?&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members still couldn’t predict the result.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Grid thought rapidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Hands? They’re easy to make!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid currently had close to 2,600 points in dexterity. There was also a large rise in proficiency due to making the two greatswords.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was more confident than ever, and made molds in the shape of his hands.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he poured the molten pavranium in the five molds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay! Perfect!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Five golden hands floated and started moving around Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was filled with joy.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was fun to imagine how these five hands could help him in the future.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t ignore the battle-oriented aspects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just imagine it!&nbsp;</span><span style>The five hands would protect him with shields, while attacking the enemy with swords.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid would be absolutely invincible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan and the blacksmiths were amazed to see hands floating in the air alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>Creating moving hands, they looked at Grid like he was a god.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huhut... Now, shall I test your performance?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid took out Failure, Iyarugt, Grid’s Greatsword, the Ideal Dagger and the Divine Shield from his inventory and commanded the five hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Arm yourselves!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pa pa pa pat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The five hands flew towards Grid and collided with the five items.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>They collided instead of grabbing the weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rather than equipping the items, the hands let them drop to the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was dismayed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What are you doing? To hold an item, you must fold your fingers. Why are you keeping your palms open?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He asked with frustrating, but the pavranium didn’t answer. They might have a will, but the pavranium was only a mineral. They couldn’t possibly talk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, this is frustrating.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The five hands lined up in front of Grid. Then he tried to teach them by repeatedly folding and unfolding his fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is rock! This is scissors! This is paper! Now follow me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pavranium didn’t move despite his passionate shouts. They just kept their palms open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, try to follow me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid cursed at the five hands floating in the air.&nbsp;</span><span style>The blacksmiths were baffled because Grid wasn’t acting as normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why is he acting like this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What’s wrong?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why is the great sun of Reidan…?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Among the young blacksmiths, Khan shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s been a while since I’ve seen this...”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[Hand Model of a Legendary Blacksmith]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attack Power: 22</span></p>
 <p><span style>A model of the hands of the legendary blacksmith Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is made of pavranium, so it can move by itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the open palms hit the opponent’s cheeks, the provocation effect is activated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 15</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid read the item description several times and belatedly realized.&nbsp;</span><span style>How delicate were the hands of a body?&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to the presence of multiple joints and muscles, fine control and all types of actions were possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, it was necessary to produce the joints for these pavranium hands to function properly.&nbsp;</span><span style>Without the joints, it was no different from a plaster of a hand. The fingers couldn’t bend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Hah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid could only sigh.&nbsp;</span><span style>He needed to fully understand the structure of a hand in order to produce what he desired. It was dark in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"First of all, look at the encyclopedia... Although...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Didn’t the anatomy books need at least an IQ of 100 to understand?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Needing to know the structure of the human body to make an item in game...!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Grid in the past would’ve cursed, asking why they didn’t make a game for stupid people to play.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, not the current Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to get what he wanted, he needed to put in the effort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took a deep breath and logged out.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘The hands consist of the thumb, the index finger, middle finger, ring finger and little finger. The thumb consists of two joints, while the fingers have three joints... The front and back of the finger have tendons, while the outer sides have the nerves and blood vessels...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shin Youngwoo searched for ‘hand’ in Korea’s largest portal site.&nbsp;</span><span style>He entered a medical encyclopedia and learned about the shape and structure of the hands.&nbsp;</span><span style>He repeated the same thing several times in order to memorize it.&nbsp;</span><span style>It couldn’t be helped because he didn’t have a good memory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don’t want to forget the contents after logging in.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, he didn’t think this was necessary.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to create an item that perfectly reproduced the functions of the hand, he could rely on the correction effect of the creation skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>He just needed the basic knowledge in order to draw a blueprint.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Youngwoo did his best to memorize the contents.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an act that originated from the desire to create perfect hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His mother’s voice was heard while he was studying for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Youngwoo! Take out the trash!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Disturbing your son who is studying for the first time in five years!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His mother always had excellent timing.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he wanted to do his homework, he would be interrupted. If he sat down in preparation to study for five hours straight, she would come into his room and lecture him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is she a psychic...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maybe she had a hidden psychic ability?&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo childishly imagined it and followed her order. He didn’t forget to wear a mask and sunglasses that perfectly covered his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will have millions of anti-fans because of Braham, so I have to be careful.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maybe he would be attacked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo was too afraid to search his name on the Internet these days.&nbsp;</span><span style>He still didn’t know the repercussions of the incident with Braham.</span></p>
