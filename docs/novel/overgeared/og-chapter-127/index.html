 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style> “Kuaaaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was more naughty and wicked than anyone else, but also more noble and divine than anyone else. The reign of Pope Drevigo ended after a long struggle.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he turned into light.&nbsp;</span><span style>The light that symbolized levelling up flashed around Grid’s body dozens of times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian was amazed as he confirmed it in the party information window.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had been level 150 and he jumped to level 170 instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Gaining 20 levels at once...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right. Grid overcame the pope who ruled over 70 million people and gained an unimaginable amount of experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Damian was in a party with Grid, but he only gained a small amount of experience. It was because the system judged that he barely contributed to the battle against the pope.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, there were two people in the party but all items dropped were one-sidedly gained by Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite the pope being defeated, Damian wasn’t able to take advantage of the experience and items in any way.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Damian wasn’t disappointed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I just used buff skills on him and tied up the feet of the paladins for a while. He took on the pope alone, and I can’t even envy him, because I didn’t give him much help.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bizarre skull helmet had been shattered by the pope.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian looked at the exposed Grid with pleasant emotions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Thanks to him, I was able to clear my hidden class change quest...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Notification windows were being renewed in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The quest ‘Goddess’ Divine Punishment’ has succeed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have changed to the unique hidden class ‘Goddess' Agent.’]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You are qualified to become the pope.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[There is a possibility that you will be elected as a pope candidate.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[If you are crowned as the pope, you can run the Rebecca Church. Please be patient until the day when tens of millions of people worship you.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The skill Goddess’ Breath has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The skill Goddess’ Breath has been mastered.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The skill Goddess’ Protection has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The skill Goddess’ Protection has been mastered.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The skill Divine Message has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Dignity stat has been opened.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The growth rate of divine power will become three times higher.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Goddess’ Breath]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Recovers 100% of your health and 70% of your party members’ health.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Mana consumption: 30% of the maximum mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: 10 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Goddess’ Protection]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creates a shield of absolute defense that will invalidate an enemy’s attack once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Mana Cost: 2,000</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: 1 hour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Divine Message]</span></p>
 <p><span style>You can hear the voice of Goddess Rebecca. The goddess will give you a lot of advice. You can earn big profits if you act on that advice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Activation Condition: Random</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Goddess’ breath and protection... Pope Drevigo used it every few minutes, but that was an NPC correction effect. For a user, it was magic with a very long cooldown time.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was he disappointed?&nbsp;</span><span style>No, that wasn’t it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian was thrilled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I didn’t realize it until now. I have a unique hidden class...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>These were the ratings of the hidden classes:&nbsp;</span><span style>Rare, epic, unique and legendary!&nbsp;</span><span style>Most of the existing hidden classes had a rare rating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>There were only three epic hidden classes revealed and no unique hidden classes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Most users and experts speculated that unique and higher hidden classes hadn’t appeared yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But at this moment!&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian was able to obtain a unique hidden class thanks to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a unique hidden class, far beyond a rare class!&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian was thrilled and felt infinite gratitude towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'In my 32 years of life, I have lived a normal life without being able to feel this sense of accomplishment once...! Grid, you are my lifelong benefactor! I don’t care if you are a psychopath. To me, you are an angel! Someday... I will repay you someday!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t know about it.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reason he defeated the pope was to clear his own quest, not to help Damian, who he didn’t even know. He was unaware that Damian had just obtained a hidden class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was undeniable that Grid was Damian’s benefactor.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the future, Damian would be sure to repay the favor to Grid, and Grid would gain a solid support without even knowing it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After knocking down the pope.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s stamina was depleted and he lay on the ground without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I can’t move a finger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to the battle with the pope, the Vatican was completely devastated.&nbsp;</span><span style>Only a few pillars were barely standing, but the ceiling had completely collapsed, so it could no longer be called a building.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a satisfied smile on Grid’s face as he looked up at the blue sky through the collapsed ceiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Jackpot.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Holy Light Armor]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Legendary (Set)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 924/924 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 872</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a high chance of completely resisting dark spells.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* 300% increased in magic recovery effects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* 40% reduction in damage from physical attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* 50% reduction in damage from magic attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-When 3 set items are equipped: Defense +500, health +6,000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An armor that the legendary blacksmith Pagma made for 5th Pope Franz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to this armor made by the god mineral adamantium, Franz was able to survive many times in the war against the Yatan Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since it was an armor customized for Franz, the other popes have stored this armor away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Conditions of Use: Franz.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 1,517&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Holy Light Gloves]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Legendary (Set)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 300/3000 &nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 130 Attack Speed: +20% &nbsp;&nbsp;Accuracy +40%</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a normal chance of activating ‘5 Joint Attacks.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a high chance of activating ‘Counterattack.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>-When 3 set items are equipped: Defense +500, health +6,000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An armor that the legendary blacksmith Pagma made for 5th Pope Franz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There is a legend that Franz, who has a weak sword technique, became a master of the sword when wearing these gloves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the gloves were personally customized for Franz, the other popes have stored these gloves away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Conditions of Use: Franz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 10</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Holy Light Crown]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Legendary (Set)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 180/180 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 20</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Intelligence +300</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Dignity +200</span></p>
 <p><span style>-When 3 set items are equipped: Defense +500, health +6,000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A crown that the legendary blacksmith Pagma made for 5th Pope Franz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There is a legend that Franz became more intelligent and dignified after wearing this crown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the crown was personally customized for Franz, the other popes have stored this crown away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Conditions of Use: Franz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 25</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike the helmet, the crown’s defense wasn’t very good. However, the effect of the set items seemed enough to cover the lack of defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The performance of the armor and gloves is the best.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid equipped the items that he obtained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A penalty is applied because the item conditions aren’t met.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Defense of Holy Light Armor will decrease by 55%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[As your understanding of the Holy Light Armor increases, the penalty will decrease.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Defense of Holy Light Gloves will decrease by 55%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[As your understanding of the Holy Light Gloves increases, the penalty will decrease.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Defense of Holy Light Crown will decrease by 55%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[As your understanding of the Holy Light Crown increases, the penalty will decrease.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the case of legendary items, the penalty for not meeting the conditions of use was 55%.&nbsp;</span><span style>Therefore, only 393 defense would be applied if Grid equipped the Holy Light Armor. The defense of the Holy Light Gloves would be 59 and the Holy Light Crown would be 9 defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But there was the effect of wearing the three set items, so the defense wasn’t low.&nbsp;</span><span style>Furthermore, the option effects were applied too.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid thought about it positively. </span></p>
 <p><span style>'This performance... The understanding of an item will naturally rise if I use it, so I don’t need to be disappointed.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, his understanding of Dainsleif had increased, so now the penalty was only around 20%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The bad thing is that they are items that can’t be widely used. No one will buy it if I put it on the auction site... How rotten.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Legendary items dropped for the first time, but why were they so special?&nbsp;</span><span style>Then a notification window flashed in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The quest ‘Help the Rebecca Church!’ has succeeded.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Affinity with the Rebecca Church has risen to the maximum. Members of the Rebecca Church will have unlimited affection and trust in you. You will be able to receive aid from them.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Talk to Rebecca’s Daughter, Isabel. She will give the goddess’ blessing to the pavranium.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had some rest so he managed to move his limbs.&nbsp;</span><span style>He unequipped the items and rose from his spot with a groan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Isabel, Rin, Damian and dozens of Rebecca members were watching him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid...”&nbsp;</span><span style>Isabel approached Grid. Tears were seen in her eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Thank you. Thanks to you, the honor of the goddess... I could keep Rin and everyone else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel bowed deeply after her words.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the other paladins and priest also bowed in unison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a solemn atmosphere.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had gotten rid of the pope who corrupted the church over the last two years, so they truly regarded him as a saviour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Cool!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t this completely a scene from a manhwa?&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian looked at Grid with envy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He viewed Grid as a hero from a manhwa.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He was like a great being who defended everyone against evil and was honoured by all after defeating the evil.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the typical look of a main character that Damian had been dreaming about. Damian truly yearned to be Grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it was only for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For free? If you really appreciate it, shouldn’t you show me some courtesy? Isn’t the Rebecca Church rich?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid made the shape of a coin with his fingers and demanded with greedy eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Give me a tip. As you can see, my helmet and armor broke due to suffering a lot of damage against the pope. I also have to claim compensation for being mentally injured after Isabel refused to return the Divine Shield.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was greedy.&nbsp;</span><span style>As everyone was speechless, Damian muttered with disappointment,&nbsp;</span><span style>"A person like this...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid followed along after Isabel and Rin. They arrived in the centre of the collapsed Vatican.&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite the Vatican being swept away in the aftermath of the destruction, there were almost no scratches on the Rebecca Statue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid handed Isabel the two discs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please use the goddess’ blessing on them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel received the golden discs. She fell to her knees in front of the goddess’ statue and started praying.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then after a few moments, a warm light came down from the sky and wrapped around the golden discs.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttiring~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[Goddess Rebecca’s blessing has fallen on the pavranium.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The pavranium will be able to demonstrate recovery abilities.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Recovery ability?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid appraised the golden discs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Golden Discs Made of Pavranium]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: Infinite</span></p>
 <p><span style>Golden discs made of pavranium, the strongest mineral produced by the collaboration between the legendary blacksmith Pagma and the legendary great magician Braham.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By default, they revolve around and protects their owner. They will also take other actions when given commands from their owner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* They have obtained healing skills due to Goddess Rebecca’s blessing. They will increase their owner’s health recovery speed by 300%.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 5</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This mineral could also acquire skills? He never even imagined it.&nbsp;</span><span style>The future was bright.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the future, he had to receive the blessings from God Dominion, God Judar and God Yatan. The pavranium would acquire new skills every time, so Grid had great expectations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But there was still the matter of God Yatan.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was an enemy of the Yatan Church!&nbsp;</span><span style>How could he get the blessing of God Yatan?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was sighing when Damian approached him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid frowned at Damian’s sudden shout.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian asked him desperately,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Can I rub my cheek against those golden discs? It is my wish of a lifetime. "</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was bewildered.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian snorted like a horny bull and explained.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Didn’t it just touch Isabel-chan’s chest? I want to feel the warmth of Isabel-chan’s chest!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An ordinary looking person was talking like this, so Grid doubted his ears.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Isabel hit Damian’s side with her elbow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keo... Keook!” Isabel-chan’s elbow... Haack...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian collapsed with a pained but happy expression.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Isabel was so embarrassed that she blew him away with the kick. Then she passed the Divine Shield to the stunned Grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We need a lot of money to rebuild the Vatican. We can’t afford to pay you a tip but... I will give you this as promised.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the moment he recovered the legendary Divine Shield that was stolen a few months ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Perfect Divine Shield]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Legendary</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 680/680 &nbsp;Defense: 370 &nbsp;Magic Resistance: 280</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a high chance of completely resisting dark spells.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The skill ‘Divine Light’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The skill ‘Divine Favor’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An item made by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but his experience and reputation is somewhat lacking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to the power of Cassus, a priest of the Rebecca Church, it shines with the divine power of the goddess of light. Due to its strength against dark magic, all followers of demons and the Yatan Church will suffer when facing this shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>User Restriction: Level 190 or higher. More than 500 strength. More than 1,000 divine power. A member of the Rebecca Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 800</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Well, this is it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was satisfied. With this Divine Shield, he was confident that he could fight the servants of the Yatan Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Yes, if I can’t willingly obtain God Yatan’s blessing, I will force them to give me the blessing.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel carefully asked him,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Are you leaving now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She felt regret.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid was a busy person. He wanted to clear the quest as quickly as possible and return to Winston.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he could spend a hot night with his beautiful bride!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have to leave. Oh, do you have any influence with the Dominion and Judar churches? I need to obtain God Dominion and God Judar’s blessings.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel smiled widely,&nbsp;</span><span style>"The Dominion Church and Judar Church are like our brothers. The Dominion Church and Judar Church have pledged allegiance to our pope... I can provide you some strength.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She felt sorry because she didn’t have anything special to give Grid for his great help. She was glad to have a chance to repay Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll write an introduction. They will willingly give their blessings with my introduction. I want to accompany you but... Sorry. There is a lot of work to do, such as electing a new pope and rebuilding the Vatican.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid looked at Damian who had been kicked by Isabel, and confirmed that he wouldn’t be able to get up for a while. Then Grid replied,&nbsp;</span><span style>"There’s no need to be sorry. I don’t want to be accompanied by a crazy girl like you. This is enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"W-What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel became gloomy at the end of his words. Rin looked at him reproachfully, but Grid didn’t notice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After receiving the letter of introduction.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid headed towards the nearest Dominion Church.</span></p>
