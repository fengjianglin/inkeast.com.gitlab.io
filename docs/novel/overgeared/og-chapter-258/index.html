 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style> ‘He’s evidently from the Rebecca Church!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why did the person with the power to kill two of the Yatan’s Servants appear in front of him now?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was to kill Dark Bus.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was the secret weapon of the Rebecca Church.&nbsp;</span><span style>He existed in order to obstruct the tasks of our church.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dark Bus misunderstood. It was a reasonable misunderstanding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I must kill him here. If we allow him to run free anymore, our church will be in a quandary.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dark Bus continued to cast magic on Grid, who was focusing on fighting with the soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it wasn’t easy to hit him.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was difficult to find a gap due to Grid’s proper use of the terrain, and the golden blades responded quickly to repeatedly block the magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Shit... He’s someone who defeated Neberius, and I can’t raise my attack power.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dark Bus specialized in curse magic, but his attack magic was weak.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the best at making a plot and directing the stage, but his combat power was the weakest among the Yatan Servants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why curse magic...!?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fundamental problem was that Grid was fully resistant to curses.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dark Bus couldn’t exert any power against him. It was really the worst situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dark Bus wondered about what to do and quickly recalled something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Asmophel!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asmophel was the next greatest swordsman after Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>He lost his skills over the past years, but he was still stronger than a regular knight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He has recently recovered from the wound given by Piaro... In the past few years, he has been constantly taking God Yatan’s essence.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Dark Bus strengthened him with magic power, the strongest monster would be born.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Overgeared! This place will be your grave today!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dark Bus shouted with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come out! Asmophel!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dark Bus was the friendly courier bringing Grid’s quest target to him. He was the popular type.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Two soldiers crossed the garden and stabbed at Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>A notification window popped up in front of Grid while he avoided the attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your demonic power has increased by two.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Demonic power.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was unfortunate stat that allowed him entry to hell if the number increased enough.&nbsp;</span><span style>Every time he killed a user or NPC, this stat increased by one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell, the name was ominous, so he didn’t want to go there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The useless stat keeps on rising.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid examined the battlefield.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were 61 soldiers remaining. There was also the black magician that was as annoying as a fly.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he killed all of them, his demonic power would rise to 154.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There is the possibility that reinforcements will arrive.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Should he borrow his pet’s hands?&nbsp;</span><span style>Would his demonic power soar if he killed a person with his pet?&nbsp;</span><span style>Randy hadn’t killed anyone when he fought the White Wolf Guild. Randy played a supporting role while Grid massacred them. Therefore, there was no basis for this premise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was worth experimenting.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid pulled Noe out of the inventory. There was no need to summon Randy to experiment. He didn’t want to distribute his experience between two pets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jjang! The best demonic beast of hell has emerged! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe wanted to appear nicely and stretched out his limbs.&nbsp;</span><span style>But his limbs were so short that it looked funny rather than nice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How come he’s getting cuter?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wanted to say. Along with the sound effect... How was this guy a demonic beast from hell?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid laughed and confirmed Noe’s status window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Noe</span></p>
 <p><span style>Species: Memphis</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level: 151</span></p>
 <p><span style>Status: Happy</span></p>
 <p><span style>(Ohhhh! This gorgeous appearance has emerged! Nyahahat!)</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Current Skills List-</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Fluidization] [Soul Ingestion] [Scratch] [Bewitchment]</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe acquired the Bewitchment skill when he reached level 150. It was a useful skill that caused the enemy to lose their will to fight.&nbsp;</span><span style>The imperial soldiers might have excellent skills, but they weren’t a match for Noe. </span><span style>Noe could hunt much higher level monsters if he used his skills well. Unless Noe wasn’t alert and allowed attacks, it was a fraudulent existence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid defended against the magic coming from the black magician with the pavranium, while ordering Noe at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go on a rampage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe flapped his small wings and flew to a soldier.&nbsp;</span><span style>The soldier tried to shake Noe off, but he was very slippery. He lightly moved to the side and stretched out his short legs.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment the soldier was struck with the soft pink soles, the soldier witnessed stars revolving around his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It hurts?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>To the soldier’s astonishment, blood poured down from the wound. The cat followed up with the sharp claws.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nya nya nya nya nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe wielded his paws at a speed that wasn’t visible.&nbsp;</span><span style>The soldier’s face quickly became bloody.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This crazy cat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldier struggled to shake Noe off. He waved his sword around. But Noe didn’t stop attacking while evading.&nbsp;</span><span style>Relentless and cruel. He truly was a demonic beast of hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ugh."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s face distorted the moment the soldier collapsed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[125,600 experience has been acquired. Some experience has been distributed to your pet ‘Noe.’]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your demonic power has increased by one.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Shit!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed that his demonic power rose even when it was his pet doing the murdering.&nbsp;</span><span style>Therefore, Grid didn’t hesitate.&nbsp;</span><span style>He recalled Noe in order to monopolize the experience, and started the slaughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid constantly used the Hooded Zip Up and started wielding two greatswords.&nbsp;</span><span style>The soldiers were unable to cling to Grid’s body due to the moving barrier of golden blades. They died in vain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Just a little bit more.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s eyes fixed on the entrance of the mansion after killing three soldiers with the Doppelganger’s Greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asmophel was in that mansion.&nbsp;</span><span style>This long journey ended with killing him.&nbsp;</span><span style>The quest reward would increase Piaro’s affinity to the maximum, then...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Piaro, be my sword.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was thrilled with excitement at the thought of gaining a great swordsman as a subordinate.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The warlock guarding the entrance of the mansion fired magic again.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This bug is annoying.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A black magician was very weak.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Based on the level of attack magic used, it seemed like he was only around level 200.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he was a little annoying to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid took care of the remaining soldiers and then rushed to the mansion.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was ready to quickly get rid of this black magician and fight against Asmophel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Did he hear the disturbance and already run away?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Grid was worrying about this...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come out! Asmophel!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sloppy looking black magician shouted and a slender man appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>The name above his head was clearly Asmophel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His target was coming to him?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was surprised by the unexpected development and the black magician shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Your rampage ends here! You will receive divine punishment...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dark Bus couldn’t finish his cry.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because Grid’s Failure had already hit his neck.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dark Bus fell with a moaning sound that was similar to the wind blowing.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Doppelganger’s Greatsword was embedded deep into his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The incensed Dark Bus jumped up. He had the weakest combat power of the Yatan Servants. However, he was a named boss so his health was in the millions. He wouldn’t die from these two strikes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid questioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why hasn’t he died yet?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t know Dark Bus’ identity. He just thought the opponent was a simple black magician.&nbsp;</span><span style>He assumed that one or two blows would kill Dark Bus.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, he had unexpectedly high health. Therefore, Grid used his insight and confirmed Dark Bus’ attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘20,000.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the combat power of a field boss.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then why was he so weak?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Anyway, I think he is the mid-boss of this quest.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid determined and pulled out Failure and the Doppelganger’s Greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Blood sprang out from both of Dark Bus’ injuries.&nbsp;</span><span style>Failure and the Doppelganger’s Greatsword rose above his head before once again descending.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Pinnacle.&nbsp;</span><span style>It exerted tremendous power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deep wounds were carved on both of Dark Bus’ shoulders.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dark Bus couldn’t understand it at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Mana Shield is useless!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The opponent was stronger than imagined. If this continued, he would die. It wasn’t good to face Grid from the front.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dark Bus hid behind Asmophel. Then he tried to command the brainwashed Asmosphel who was standing around like a doll.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid’s actions were faster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shockwaves aimed at Dark Bus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He was filled with pain as his neck was struck.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Failure’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘Bisect’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Failure’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘5 Joint Attacks’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Flop.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dark Bus lost his head and collapsed.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was truly the last attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is a magician so durable... Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid clicked his tongue at the persistent health. Then notification windows flashed in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have defeated the Seventh Servant Dark Bus, who spread chaos through the world!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have saved the Saharan Empire from a crisis by interfering with the conspiracy of the Yatan Church.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Reputation throughout the continent will rise by +3.000.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You currently have 28,110 reputation throughout the continent. You can use the Reputation Store when your reputation reaches over 30,000.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The title ‘Secret Hero’ has been obtained.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The title 'Yatan Servant’s Slaughterer’ has been obtained.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Three Blessed Weapon Enhancement Stones have been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Seven Blessed Armour Enhancement Stones have been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Three deluxe magic stones has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Dark Bus’ Earrings have been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Dark Bus’ Ring has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[88,052,440 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style>A Yatan Servant?&nbsp;</span><span style>This weak guy?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asmophel was liberated from the brainwashing and approached Grid, who was staring blankly at Dark Bus’ corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The hero who punished the wicked Yatan Servant. My savior... Can you listen to my unfair story?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[’The True Traitor of the Red Knights (SS)’ quest has been changed to the ‘Hidden Story (Hidden)’ quest.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was this situation?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"???"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The question marks in Grid’s head didn’t disappear.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asmosphel spoke as Grid made a stupid expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"One day, Empress Marie came to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a long story.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asmophel explained in detail how Marie approached him and sowed discord with Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Yatan Essence.&nbsp;</span><span style>A single drop of it could extremely weaken the human mind and cause the body’s mana to become chaotic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He talked about the process of being brainwashed by Dark Bus and becoming a perfect puppet. Asmophel was trembling and crying when talking about being used, and eventually ruining Piaro and his colleagues.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someday... If the day comes when you meet a man called Piaro, please tell him this. I’m sorry. I’m really sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asmophel pulled out his sword and pointed it at his own neck.&nbsp;</span><span style>He moved the sword without any hesitation. Asmophel’s sword touched his neck.&nbsp;</span><span style>He intended to atone for his atrocities with death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he couldn't die.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid stopped him before the sword could deeply pierce his neck.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid reached out to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t leave it to others and apologize directly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first condition of the hidden quest that Grid obtained was the reunion of Piaro and Asmophel.&nbsp;</span><span style>The people who were praised as the pillars of the empire in the past were about to be reborn as Reidan’s pillars.</span></p>
