 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Grid answered without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Daughter! I want a daughter!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t a son better than a daughter as the successor?&nbsp;</span><span style>That didn’t matter to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He just wanted a child that was like Irene.&nbsp;</span><span style>The girl would be bright, kind, and beautiful, unlike him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am afraid a son will resemble me!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Typically, a daughter resembled the father and the son resembled the mother, but Grid didn’t believe this.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t think a girl would have his appearance and personality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Do you really want a daughter?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Okay. The baby who will be born soon will reflect your will.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the smithy to the castle.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid ran through the streets using the shortest path.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to see his child’s face as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"You aren’t late.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was waiting for him at the gates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s been 30 minutes since them midwife entered. Maybe the child will be born soon. Before that, are you really going to name your child Grene? Huh? How about rethinking the name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was sleep deprived, as always.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the game, he was busy managing Reidan, Bairan, and Cork Island, while in reality, he was responding to the endless flood of inquiries about joining the guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>So Lauel’s somewhat tense words were heard as they headed to the 3rd floor.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Cry!</span></i> <i><span style>Cry!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The cries of a newborn baby was heard from Irene’s bedroom at the end of the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The maid assisting the midwife ran out and shouted.&nbsp;</span><span style>The emotions in Grid’s heart were indescribable.&nbsp;</span><span style>He really became a father!&nbsp;</span><span style>He felt a vague fear, but his joy was much greater.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Daughter!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The maid responded with a bright expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your son!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eh?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an unexpected and shocking answer.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid received a mental blow.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Marquis Steim and his vassals were dancing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A precious baby boy was born in our family! A young gentleman, young gentleman!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Congratulations Duke Grid and Marquis Steim!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I wish you the best!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A young gentleman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A son?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Didn’t it say that his choice would have a large effect on the gender of the child when born, so what was this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid belatedly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I was originally unlucky.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When had anything ever gone as he wanted?&nbsp;</span><span style>There were few occasions. The result always went against him.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had been lucky since becoming Pagma’s Descendant, but before that, he had been so unlucky that he wondered if he had sold a country in his previous life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, this was the reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid sighed and entered Irene’s bedroom.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Dear husband... It’s a boy who resembles you. I’m so happy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene's complexion was noticeably tired. It was difficult to fathom how painful childbirth would be.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Irene’s smile was brighter than ever.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid realized something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It might be more influenced by Irene’s wish than my bad luck.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was relieved when he saw the baby in Irene’s eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>What did it matter if it was a daughter or a son?&nbsp;</span><span style>Proof of their precious love had been born.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was glad and happy.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the first place...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘We can always have another child if I want a daughter.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene was the only daughter of her family, so she had a strong desire for many children. She wanted to constantly give birth if she could.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid smiled and kissed Irene’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You must’ve suffered. Thank you. Thank you for giving this gift to me. Above all, I wish for you to be healthy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Dear husband...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene was always affectionate towards Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Irene was thrilled and handed the child to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Please hug him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“U-Um.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was startled.&nbsp;</span><span style>Didn’t the child have black hair like him?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was concerning.&nbsp;</span><span style>His son, he looked like Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Please let his nature be different...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid sincerely wished as Irene handed the child to him. Then his eyes widened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why is he so pretty?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Babies who were just born and couldn’t open their eyes reminded him of monkeys.&nbsp;</span><span style>But what was this?&nbsp;</span><span style>The white skin was resilient and the already opened eyes were blue like Irene.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were intense eyes like gemstones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s mouth stretched widely as he looked at his son.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an exquisite combination of himself and Irene, so an infinite affection rose inside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is the name of our grandchild?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marquis Steim asked. His mouth was also stretched widely. He looked even more delighted than Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The child’s name...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone’s attention focused on Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, Lauel was staring at him with eager eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Please don’t let it be Grene!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was his wish heard?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid spoke a normal name for some reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Don’t be despised like him, be loved and respected by all.&nbsp;</span><span style>Don’t be envious of others like him, but have a wide heart.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a name filled with these wishes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Lord...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a good name.&nbsp;</span><span style>It happened when everyone, including Lauel, was feeling happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Maybe I should add my initial preceding it, G-lord.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel’s expression twisted.&nbsp;</span><span style>He shouted angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Glord! That is a name that copies the format of an orc chief!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid felt relieved of the frustration that filled him for a decade.&nbsp;</span><span style>Glord.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a name that he came up thanks to all his naming experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Phew, it’s cool.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel saw Grid’s expression and shouted again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please just name him Lord!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isn’t that too common?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is better than a name that copies an orc chief!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was correct.&nbsp;</span><span style>Glord was a proper noun in Satisfy, so it was right to avoid it.&nbsp;</span><span style>After a moment, Grid nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Okay, I understand. The name of this child is Lord.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Congratulations on the fruit of the couple’s love!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You are the first user to become a father!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The title ‘First Father’ has been obtained.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[First Father]</span></p>
 <p><span style>* When you are in a party with your child, all of your stats will increase by 8%.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the child’s health drops below 30%, the passive skill ‘Father’s Instinctive Love’ will be activated, increasing movement speed by 80% for 20 seconds and resetting skill cooldown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Resetting skill cooldown time!&nbsp;</span><span style>It was truly a huge passive skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was glad when he suddenly felt doubts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Party?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why would he go hunting with his child?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why is it like this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Lord’s status window floated in front of Grid’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Lord Steim</span></p>
 <p><span style>Age: 0 years &nbsp;Gender: Male</span></p>
 <p><span style>Occupation: Young Nobleman</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: Grid’s Son</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The son of a legendary blacksmith. He has inherited most of his father’s abilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: Genius of Eternal</span></p>
 <p><span style>* A genius that represents a country. He overwhelms local geniuses, and his level and abilities will rise 40% faster than normal. In addition, he can acquire skills in a wide range of fields.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there is a limit to the level and abilities that can be raised until he is 15 years old.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: One who Will Become a Legend</span></p>
 <p><span style>A person who will leave his name in history. There is an 80% chance of being immune to all status effects and illnesses. When attacked, if his health falls to 1 point, he will enter the immortal state for 2.5 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level: 1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strength: 31 &nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 39</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agility: 25 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligence: 47</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dexterity: 90 &nbsp;Charm: 100</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dignity: 15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insight: 78</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skills: Beginner Blacksmith Skill (F), Beginner Weapons Mastery (C), Discerning Eyes (S), Overwhelming Charm (S), Famous and Legendary Pedigree (SS). </span></p>
 <p><span style>His mother is the successor of a noble family in the Eternal Kingdom and his father is a legend.&nbsp;</span><span style>He has inherited all of his parent’s strengths, so his potential is outstanding. Teaching him will be inspiring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, his talent and environment are so good that he is likely to become arrogant. Education will determine his history.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is completely...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A gold spoon in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was forced to admire it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Steim.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the day when the overlord of the world, who would later have the name of the Overgeared clan, was born.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Abu. Abu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been a week since Lord was born.&nbsp;</span><span style>Compared to when he was born, the beauty of the child was already shining.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had Grid’s eyes and high nose, the good parts of Grid, as well as Irene’s face, skin, lips, and pupils.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"So pretty."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Saintess Ruby arrived in Reidan two days ago. She had wanted to see her nephew’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style>She smiled and didn’t leave Lord’s side.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, three women were uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura, Jishuka, and Sexy Schoolgirl.&nbsp;</span><span style>The women who gathered in one place after a long time were struggling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Well, I’ll admit that the baby is pretty. However, the next baby that I’ll give birth to will be better. Think about it. How dignified and sexy would a child born from Grid and I be?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Jishuka who talked with confidence.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sexy Schoolgirl couldn’t believe her ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh my~ Jishuka, are you going to marry Grid? Ah, in the game like Irene?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huhut, this young girl is talking nonsense. If I was to marry Grid, it should be in reality. You can play the role of concubine in the game.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sister, do you not like me? Are you afraid that I will be sexier than you after one or two years? Yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This kid, shouldn’t you be more self-conscious?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be quiet. I don’t have the emotions of a kid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura intervened between the two girls. She was calm in front of Lord, unlike Jishuka and Sexy Schoolgirl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yura, aren’t you worried? Irene and Grid will probably become closer after Lord is born. Our positions will become smaller."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura spoke to Sexy Schoolgirl in a nonchalant manner,&nbsp;</span><span style>"I am already treated as a folding screen. I don’t need to worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the meantime, Grid was indifferent towards Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style>One of the world’s most beautiful women, Yura, was treated as a folding screen. Jishuka and Sexy Schoolgirl honestly couldn’t believe it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee laughed from where she was playing with Lord with the baby toys that Grid had drawn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'It is because Oppa is very shy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone forgot it because Grid was married, but he had no experience with love in reality. In reality, he hadn’t even held hands with a woman.&nbsp;</span><span style>An unrealistically beautiful and talented woman like Yura was too high of a barrier to be his first love.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ah, it might be different if Yura had a big chest like Jishuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s really amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldier Royman reached level 160 under the thorough guidance of Piaro and Asmophel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was thrilled when he confirmed Royman’s information with the Great Lord's Sword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, a huge 5,000 troops were entering Reidan’s vast desert.</span></p>
