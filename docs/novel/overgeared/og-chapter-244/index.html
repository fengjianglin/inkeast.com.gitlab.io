 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The material and shape of the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch looked ordinary. It was just a black eye patch made of leather. &nbsp;Nothing special could be seen about the eye patch.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Grid of the past would’ve complained before appraising it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is shit! I wasted 10 days just trying to get an eyepatch? Damn! What is this? Lauel, you $%!#$!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would say.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would throw a tantrum.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid was no longer so immature.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Lauel wouldn’t advise me to get this for nothing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There must be something about the item.&nbsp;</span><span style>An item wasn’t something that could be distinguished with just the appearance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had high expectations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Legendary Blacksmith’s Appraisal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The blacksmith who became a legend can appraise items with an excellent discerning eye. If a hidden feature exists in the target item, it will be found.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttiring~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[Slaughterer’s Eye Patch]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 7/7</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The skill ‘Vital Spot Detection’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Slaughterer was tortured for a long time. He was also forced to watch the torture of countless people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a result, he has a high grasp of vital spots.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This eyepatch has been used by the Slaughterer for a long time and gained this ability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Conditions of Use: None.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 0.1</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have discovered a hidden feature in the item!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This is an item with a grudge. The wearer will be dominated by the impulse to kill and will become a reckless murderer.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Curse. It was a cursed item.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was impossible to play the game normally if he was a senseless murderer.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid didn’t care.&nbsp;</span><span style>Curse?&nbsp;</span><span style>He could just resist it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lauel, this nice guy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was thrilled. He wanted to summon Lauel right now and embrace him.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Slaughterer’s Eye Patch was a good item.&nbsp;</span><span style>No, it wasn’t just at the level of good.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an item that helped Pagma's Descendant take off the ‘limit.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I didn’t think I would get Vital Spot Detection.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vital Spot Detection.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a top grade passive skill that only a small number of classes optimized for battle would acquire.&nbsp;</span><span style>The function was simple.&nbsp;</span><span style>As the name suggested, it identified the opponent’s vital spots.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But this simple function had enormous power.&nbsp;</span><span style>If the vital spot was hit correctly, the probability of a critical hit would increase, causing bleeding, paralysis and other conditions.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, it meant that his attack power would increase dramatically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Lauel, he got something huge from Haynes.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>First ranked monster discerner, Haynes.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was able to predict the items that monsters would drop based on their characteristics.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Minor was a minerals detector, Haynes was an item detector.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Lauel would’ve paid a lot of money to get this information from Haynes.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid realized that Lauel’s heart was deepening.&nbsp;</span><span style>He worked hard to overcome his master’s weakness, so Grid’s liking towards him increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Lauel is busy with acting as the lord... I must surely reward his hard work.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid promised happily as he wore the eye patch. Then something interesting happened.&nbsp;</span><span style>The left eye, covered by an eye patch, started to emit a dim red light. It was so weak that it was hardly noticeable in a bright place. However, it was clearly visible in dark spaces like this basement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel would be very excited when he saw this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your hatred for humans is growing. You are filled with the urge to murder someone.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was being provided a new perspective.&nbsp;</span><span style>Randy stood beside him and Grid could clearly see the ‘core’ of the doppelganger. It wasn’t precise, but it was powerful enough to be able to grasp the target’s vital points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I was worried that the vision on one side would be obscured. Fortunately, that isn’t the case.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a perfect artifact.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, that was on the assumption that the murderous impulse curse could be suppressed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s joy was comparable to when he raided the pope and acquired the Holy Light set.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then...”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid watched Noe. He had a cute tail of modest length. A white part at the end looked like a flower.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Your tail is your weakness...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I am the best demonic beast of hell. I don’t have a weakness! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe bluffed and raised his palms. He seemed to be bewildered at his weakness being seen through.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid thought about making Noe an armor to defend his tail. Then he turned his attention to another item dropped by the Slaughterer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Slaughterer’s Mask.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an iron mask designed to cover the right half of the face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The material is black iron.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike ordinary masks, this one was made from a good mineral. However, the design was dismal.&nbsp;</span><span style>The crying eye shape seemed the opposite of the smiling mouth shape.&nbsp;</span><span style>It looked like a clown’s mask. There were even a few teardrops carved into it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I didn’t hear anything about this mask.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was probably a small item that wasn’t worth emphasizing.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t have much expectations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Legendary Blacksmith’s Appraisal.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttiring~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[The Slaughterer’s Mask]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Legendary</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 39/39 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 21</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The skill ‘Evil Spirit’s Bloody Tears’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is a mask that reflects the sadness of the Slaughterer, a being who lived a painful life just before he was born as a half man, half beast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Conditions of Use: None.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 55</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have discovered a hidden feature in the item!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This is an item with a grudge. &nbsp;The wearer will be dominated by the impulse to kill and will become a reckless murderer.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Evil Spirit’s Bloody Tears]</span></p>
 <p><span style>When hit, there is a 8% chance of releasing a blood flow. The ejected blood will paint the Slaughterer’s mask with blood. When this happens 10 times, the mask will turn a distinct red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that time, the wearer’s attack power will increase by 50% for 5 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crazy.”&nbsp;</span><span style>He reflexively exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was astonished.&nbsp;</span><span style>Evil Spirit’s Bloody Tears.&nbsp;</span><span style>It might be a conditionally triggered skill, but its power was excellent. It was a fraudulent skill. It was a legendary rated artifact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Lauel didn’t mention this item because he didn’t know.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was proof that Haynes was still lacking.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a result, it was a huge profit.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Haynes knew about the existence of this mask, Lauel would’ve had to pay a bigger fee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kukukuk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid couldn’t help laughing.&nbsp;</span><span style>Half his face was covered with a black mask and his left eye shone red, making him look like a demon.&nbsp;</span><span style>The level of oppression was much higher than when he wore the Frostlight Orc Chief’s Helmet in the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel would be shocked if he saw it.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“T-This...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Zebra ran after hearing the news and couldn’t believe the scene in front of him.&nbsp;</span><span style>The undefeatable Slaughterer was dead, leaving only a few body parts behind.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was caused by only one person!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-Who are you? Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was this really the skills of a human?&nbsp;</span><span style>Zebra gulped after asking the question.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was frightened after seeing Grid in the bizarre mask and eye patch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There is a red light in his eyes...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t look like a human being at all.&nbsp;</span><span style>Maybe he was a real demon?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid reached out to Earl Zebra.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give me the earrings.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“U-Understood!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Zebra handed his most prized treasure to Grid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The Black Quartz Earrings increased the wearer’s intelligence by 15%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a beautiful treasure that had been passed down through his family for generations.&nbsp;</span><span style>He never thought there would come a day when he would really give this to someone. Now it was wasted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I was supposed to give this to the knights who are coming to kill the Slaughterer... Shit, I need to send assassins after this guy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Zebra’s greed caused him to make a wicked plan.&nbsp;</span><span style>But who was the greedy one?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid could read Earl Zebra’s eyes instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This ridiculous guy.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pisik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smirked. Then Earl Zebra asked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-Why are you suddenly smiling?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cute.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Zebra’s face filled with anger.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was an earl of the great empire and over 40 years old, yet he was called cute? As if he was a pet? This was an obvious taunt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This insane bastard!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Zebra didn’t like Grid at all. From the beginning, this young man had a nasty spirit. Earl Zebra wanted to brutally torture and kill Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T-Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Earl Zebra had difficulty meeting the eyes of Grid, who killed the Slaughterer alone. First, he just wanted Grid to get lost.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid equipped the Black Quartz Earrings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Intelligence will increase by 15%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is the reward for a S+ grade quest.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, an accessory that increased intelligence by 15% was very valuable. Any magician would covet it.&nbsp;</span><span style>But thanks to the effects of all types of titles, Grid’s intelligence already exceeded 1,000 and he didn’t need it.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was able to have enough mana to use all his skills and didn’t use Dainsleif anymore, so magic power wasn’t that important.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will use this until I can find a craftsman who can make an accessory out of blue orichalcum.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid threw a question to Earl Zebra, who was avoiding his gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you think about weak people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a confusing question.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Zebra wanted this ghastly man to disappear. But he didn’t dare express his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That is something I don’t know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was a powerful man, born as the son of an earl. Tens of thousands of people bowed before him, and thousands of soldiers obeyed him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Weak?&nbsp;</span><span style>He had no interest in such things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid nodded.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Right. You wouldn’t know about such a thing."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was never subjected to one-sided bullying.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid knew there was nothing as painful and terrible as that.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had no desire to save Earl Zebra, who had committed a crime against his people and tortured people for his own entertainment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You, aren’t you weak?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The red eyes swept over Earl Zebra’s entire body.&nbsp;</span><span style>Zebra’s instincts screamed at him and he stepped back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-What? What are you trying to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid shrugged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What am I doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he just left?&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Zebra was relieved to hear Grid’s footsteps leaving.&nbsp;</span><span style>He waited until he couldn’t hear the footsteps anymore, before running to someone else.</span></p>
