 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone, master of the 13th city, was an earl, while the master of cities in the 10s were viscounts.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura was well aware of the strength of a viscount type vampire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘At least five of the elites of Overgeared must be present to raid them.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It might be possible if she completed all her class quests and went over level 300, but she couldn’t do it alone right now.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura judged this and focused on survival.&nbsp;</span><span style>She fought defensively in order to buy as much time as possible for her scattered colleagues to return.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Tiramet’s combat power was too destructive.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was stronger than the other viscounts she had met.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'He met a former Demon Slayer and survived.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clearly a unique event, meaning...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Named boss!’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura avoided the bleeding magic, but her range of actions was constrained.&nbsp;</span><span style>Soon after, she was faced with a kick flying at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can’t avoid it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She would lose at least a third of her health.&nbsp;</span><span style>The key was to not allow any linked attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura calculated the angle and deliberately moved her body.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment she was hit, she would be blown back to the rear pillar and planned to use that gap to regain her posture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Syuk~</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A shining golden shield came flying and protected Yura from Tiramet’s kick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura’s normally always calm eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style>She knew who the owner of this golden shield was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why was he here when he should be in the Behen Archipelago?&nbsp;</span><span style>How did he enter, and why did he only show up in important moments to help her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will keep depending on you if this happens.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Yura’s sad expression was beautiful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The True Blood vampires were divided into two types.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were the nine children born directly by Shizo Beriache, and those made using their blood.&nbsp;</span><span style>Viscount Tiramet was a direct descendant.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was at least three times stronger than the usual made vampire viscounts, so it was right to call him a quasi-earl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was being threatened by a human?&nbsp;</span><span style>It didn’t make sense.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unless his opponent had the title of a legend!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Linked Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuaaaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiramet’s body was pierced five times by a blue-black energy blade, causing him to scream terribly.&nbsp;</span><span style>The black haired human who suddenly appeared, his attack power was devastating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The angry Tiramet waved his hand, causing his magic power to move.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the manifestation of transfusion magic that hit all targets and took away their health.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A non-targeted skill.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black haired man, Grid’s, eyes changed.&nbsp;</span><span style>He withdrew the greatsword that was inserted into Tiramet’s chest, while using the footwork of Link to avoid the blood magic.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a remarkable accomplishment, considering the timing and speed of the magic. Of course, the aid of the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch was also great.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You rat bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiramet shouted as his health went down and he punched out.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid’s skill deployment was quicker, since he was already completing the footsteps of Link.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Link.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A little while ago, Grid had stabbed Tiramet’s chest rather than his head.&nbsp;</span><span style>The head would receive more damage, but he wasn’t able to hit the enemy’s head with 100% accuracy with his current skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Link was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>The range of the slashes was much wider than a stabbing attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This will hurt.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pit!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pipipipipit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time as Grid’s proclamation, Tiramet’s face was mangled.&nbsp;</span><span style>Tiramet was shaken by the terrible pain and pulled out a trump card.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blood Tornado!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Magic power moved around Tiramet like a whirlwind.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s body was swept into the air by it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Five blood missiles flew towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“God Hands!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Syuok!</span></i> <i><span style>Syuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Two golden hands came flying at Grid’s call. They spread open their palms and blocked the Blood Missile, but stiffened.&nbsp;</span><span style>The three remaining Blood Missiles hit Grid’s head and chest.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was an explosion and Grid coughed up blood.&nbsp;</span><span style>Tiramet confirmed it and laughed with excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuhahat! You’re quite strong, but you’re still human! There’s a large physical difference between you and I! A human body is like dry leaves, while the body of a True Blood vampire is like steel!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was true, but Tiramet was also hurt by his wounds.&nbsp;</span><span style>The damage from the human destroyed common sense and half his health was consumed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'But!'</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had vampire magic.&nbsp;</span><span style>Tiramet smiled and aimed magic at both Grid and Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"My body is a stone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiramet’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style>The human received three Blood Missiles and was far from death!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why is a human so durable...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Magic Missile."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jiing.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Magic Missile (Enhanced) Lv. 2.&nbsp;</span><span style>The legendary spell, which had become more powerful in the Behen Archipelago, accurately penetrated Tiramet’s heart.&nbsp;</span><span style>Tiramet thought it was ludicrous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I was hit by a Magic Missile?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why was a magician so tough?&nbsp;</span><span style>No, why did he use a sword so well if he was a magician?&nbsp;</span><span style>Tiramet was feeling astonished when Grid appeared above him, drinking a health potion.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The blue-black greatsword struck like a lightning bolt!&nbsp;</span><span style>The momentum was great, but it was easily caught by Tiramet’s left hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This body won’t be caught by the same pattern!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tirament stretched out his right hand.&nbsp;</span><span style>He grabbed Grid’s neck and pushed him into a pillar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blood Burn!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s body was pushed into the pillar and swept away by the explosion of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura’s face paled.&nbsp;</span><span style>No matter how good his items, stats, and class, she was worried that Grid wouldn’t be safe from this attack.&nbsp;</span><span style>She had forgotten for a moment.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was someone who fought against Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Already making me use Doran’s ring.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s appearance was moderately fine.&nbsp;</span><span style>But his expression wasn’t good.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I still have a long way to go.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel wouldn’t have been caught by the neck when the attack was blocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'He would’ve aimed for the head with the first Linked Kill.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was Grid frustrated after knowing he was lacking so much, despite going to the Behen Archipelago?&nbsp;</span><span style>No.&nbsp;</span><span style>Just like Kraugel and Yura, Grid was now aiming to be the best.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t be so easily frustrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s start properly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This guy keeps on speaking nonsense... Hah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiramet, who was laughing with a relaxed expression, hurriedly moved from his position. Two golden hands appeared in the air.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The hands could fly on their own through the air with weapons?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Artifacts that can be used for both offense and defense, and move by themselves...! It is big!’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Chaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The God Hands’ Sword Mastery level had grown from the beginner to intermediate level.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the result of Grid repeatedly using them in the Behen Archipelago.&nbsp;</span><span style>They wielded the Ideal Dagger, the Doppelganger’s Greatsword, and fired Magic Missiles to tie up Tiramet’s feet for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it wasn’t enough to drive Tiramet to the defensive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What can you do with such shameful artifacts?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeong!</span></i> <i><span style>Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tiramet grasped the trajectory of the two God Hands, avoided them and reached for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Die!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He fired Blood Fire, which dealt both fire damage proportional to his health.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid faced the heat and revealed his power for the first time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blackening.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your black magic power has increased.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You don’t have any black magic power. It will be replaced with demonic power.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[While Blackening is activated, your species will change to half-demon.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[As a half demon, your maximum health is reduced by 50%. Your attack power, magic power, and agility will increase by 20% each.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[All attacks will be converted to the black magic attribute.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Quick Movements.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The skill attached to the Ideal Dagger equipped to the God Hand has now been activated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your evasion rate is increased by 30% and your agility is doubled for 1 minute.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blacksmith's Rage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Attack power will increase by 25% and attack speed will increase by 40% for 35 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then...</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The items have successfully combined!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The combination time of Failure and Iyarugt will last 2 minutes.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason that Grid only used two God Hands during the battle wasn’t to make fun of Tiramet.&nbsp;</span><span style>He recognized and appreciated Tiramet’s strength, so he had used the Item Combination skill with two God Hands just before entering battle.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Clink!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The two God Hands flew here and gave Grid a new weapon. Based on his increased agility, Grid evaded the Blood Fire and gave orders to each God Hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Open. Magic Missile."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Syu syu syu syu syuk!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The hands scattered all over the place fired a Magic Missile at Tiramet, making it difficult for Tiramet to avoid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This technique... Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiramet cried out as he deployed Blood Shields to defend against the Magic Missiles.&nbsp;</span><span style>The black haired man, who was hard to define as a human anymore, was coming closer?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Fling Blood!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Continuous Stab!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeong!</span></i> <i><span style>Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tiramet wasn’t ordinary.&nbsp;</span><span style>Using the Fling Blood skill, he was able to boost his stats and defend against three of Grid’s five attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid judged that he was unable to achieve five combos in this situation and used Blood Cry.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kakiing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk... No, that’s Elfin Stone’s!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiramet’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid saw an opportunity and chopped at Tiramet’s shoulder with Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Pinnacle.&nbsp;</span><span style>From here, Iyarugt’s power activated properly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The 3rd combo has been achieved!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The damage done to the target will increase by 200% for 1 second.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Urgh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiramet’s face wrinkled as he was affected. Yet he tried to fight back, proving his strength. It wasn’t comparable to Elfin Stone, but Tiramet far exceeded the weakened Hell Gao.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was expecting Tiramet’s counterattack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Revolve.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The counterattack came on cue.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the moment when Grid’s aim was completed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The 5th combo has been achieved!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The target’s sense of reason has collapsed for 0.3 seconds.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The skill ‘Hell Sword’ can be linked.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The skill must be activated within 0.3 seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Grid could strike at the right timing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hell Sword.”</span></p>
