 <p><span style>Chapter 417</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was a legendary class, and the most famous one among the informal rankers.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was behind so many topics that even people indifferent to Satisfy knew Grid’s name.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But evaluations were split in two.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was either an inexperienced person lucky to obtain a legendary class, or he had the ability itself to acquire a legendary class. And so on.&nbsp;</span><span style>A person who received both praise and criticism like Grid was rare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, those who praised Grid and those who criticized him came to a common consensus.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was strong. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But Tarma thought differently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m stronger than a blacksmith.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, Tarma had seen Grid’s battle video several times. Grid was lacking a lot when seen from the viewpoint of a combat specialist.&nbsp;</span><span style>His combat skills were all aggressive and lacked any defense, but he had no control skills to cover for that lack of defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Well, he might seem good when looking at it from the level of the public.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tarma ridiculed and made a shooing motion with his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get lost, small fry. I don’t have time to deal with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before the National Competition started, the world predicted that Grid wouldn’t play a big role, and it was the same for Tarma’s client.&nbsp;</span><span style>Tarma’s client didn’t put a bounty on Grid’s head.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, Tarma didn’t target Grid. It was a waste of energy to kill him.&nbsp;</span><span style>He intended on sending Grid away, but his tone was the problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Get lost, small fry?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t like Tarma’s attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What did you call me? Get lost?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? What are you saying?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tarma didn’t understand Grid’s slang.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Grid raised his middle finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Eat this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was more welcoming towards the people around him, but his innate personality was still far from being gentle.&nbsp;</span><span style>The worst of his nature emerged when it came to people like Tarma.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You bastard...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tarma’s face distorted like he was a demon.&nbsp;</span><span style>The second reason for Grid’s grudge was that Tarma was at the point where Grid expected Kraugel to be.&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to that, Grid missed the timing for a perfect surprise attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This can't be forgiven..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tarma growled out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Small fry, I will give you a chance to die under my glorious hands.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The world knew Faker as the strongest assassin.&nbsp;</span><span style>Faker was responsible for wiping out one of the seven guilds, the Ice Flower Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>But those who knew Tarma evaluated Tarma as higher than Faker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The unofficial ranker, Assassin Tarma.&nbsp;</span><span style>The activities he showed in the world of darkness were greater than Faker’s achievements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Tarma? Who’s that? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Um, let’s see... A third advancement assassin belonging to Greece. His class is Shadow Master... He’s an unofficial ranker because his level isn’t disclosed. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were currently hundreds of cameras installed on Tira Island, capturing the movements of the participants in real time.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the videos that the broadcasting stations could show were limited, so the users who weren’t famous weren’t exposed to the viewers. One of them was Tarma.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But at this moment.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid destroyed the allied teams and came across Tarma, making Tarma subject to the attention of the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Tarma?</span></i> <i><span style>He has a third advancement class, which means he’s at a minimum, the same level as the 80th ranker.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>There seems to be little exposure about him.</span></i> <i><span style>He’s probably a person who only eats and hunts.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Most viewers didn’t know Tarma. It was the same for the international commentators.&nbsp;</span><span style>But those who knew the world of Satisfy more deeply were well aware of Tarma.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Tarma is a well known assassin. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 There is a rumor that Tarma has assassinated over 100 rankers. Even the 2nd ranked Zibal was assassinated by Tarma. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Have you heard about that dark gamer group called Blood Carnival? Tarma is one of the monsters of that infamous group. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 There’s a saying that the true god of death is Tarma, not Faker. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Internet was shocked by the comments from the experts.&nbsp;</span><span style>The real time search terms on Internet portal sites were dominated by Tarma and Blood Carnival.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Wow...</span></i> <i><span style>This is the first time I’ve heard of Blood Carnival, but their power is huge.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>An unbelievably wicked group...</span></i> <i><span style>Are they the Triads of Satisfy?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>13 kingdoms have bounties on the Blood Carnival, but their base can’t be found.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>It seems like Tarma isn’t a simple assassin;; Did Grid pick the wrong opponent?</span></i> <i><span style>Isn’t it dangerous?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-Yiing</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dozens of drones scattered through the forest started gathering around Grid and Tarma.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was proof that the world was paying attention to both people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah, this is really...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tarma scratched his head as he saw all the cameras.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was only in the National Competition to assassinate Kraugel, so he wanted to avoid people’s attention to act more freely.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, this was ruined due to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"After I kill you, all the participating countries will be alert towards me. I’m being bothered by this little chick.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tarma complained while pulling out the logo of the Lion Group.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Lion Group.&nbsp;</span><span style>One of the world’s top 10 companies, they were the ones who sponsored Tarma.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Since so much attention is being paid to a small fry, I might as well get money from it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tarma attached the logo of the Lion Group to his chest.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he started to emit a dark aura as he pulled out two yellow daggers.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a PK only weapon that he acquired from quests in Gaya, the sandy kingdom on the East continent that most users hadn’t even seen yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is the strongest weapon that makes those on the West Continent look stupid. Overgeared? Pffft! That’s a word that describes me!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tarma shouted with confidence and shadows emerged from everywhere.&nbsp;</span><span style>The ground, bushes, trees, rocks, etc.&nbsp;</span><span style>Tarma’s shadow spread all over the place and deceived the viewers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The shadows are moving!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tarma disappeared into a shadow.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was perfect.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was at a level that could be called the strongest hiding technique, so the comments, experts and viewers around the world admired it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Grid was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past, Grid had experienced the shadow assassin called Kasim.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was able to grasp Tarma’s identity the moment that Tarma’s shadow started wriggling. Based on this, he used Magic Detection (Enhanced) Lv. 2 in advance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Magic Detection Lv. 2 had a long casting time and couldn’t accurately detect the position of an assassin moving in real time. However, Grid’s Magic Detection was one developed by the legendary great magician, Braham.&nbsp;</span><span style>It transcended common sense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, Grid had his high insight and the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch.&nbsp;</span><span style>All the conditions were in place to make it a perfect disaster for Tarma.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tarma emerged from the shadow of the tree next to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He stared at Grid, intent on killing Grid before he was detected.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid’s Greatsword was aiming towards the point where he appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Linked Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk!</span></i> <i><span style>Puk!</span></i> <i><span style>Puk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An assassin’s weaknesses were their low health and defense.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were proud of their excellent stealth and lethality, but their bodies were the weakest of all damage dealers.&nbsp;</span><span style>How could an assassin survive Linked Kill, which was superior to Linked Kill Wave when it came to just attack power?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was only fortunate if they could avoid it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tarma couldn’t even scream as he turned to grey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Wow. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The commentators and experts took a deep breath.&nbsp;</span><span style>The 1st ranked real time topic on search portals was ‘3 seconds.’&nbsp;</span><span style>After logging out Hurent in 5 seconds and Bondre in 4 seconds in the last National Competition, now Grid had set a new record.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was very cliche, but the world was once again astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the first day of the National Competition, Grid was overturning the world several times.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘A very strong guy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid realized the moment he read where Tarma would emerge and used Linked Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style>Tarma didn’t give up and fought back, cutting Grid’s wrist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I received 3,000 damage...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid resisted it, but the attack also caused poisoning and paralysis.&nbsp;</span><span style>The power was tremendous. If he couldn’t kill Tarma with one blow and if Linked Kill had only done three strikes, Grid thought it would have been dangerous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had eyes that could measure an opponent’s ability just by exchanging one blow.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was something he developed after numerous battles with enemies stronger than him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Grid was becoming a real powerhouse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 The US team has started catching up with the South Korean team! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Currently, there are only three survivors in the Korean team. It’s inevitable that their speed will slow down compared to other teams. Isn’t it possible for them to lose their first place to the United States? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The words of the commentators alarmed Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>After confirming the scoreboard, Grid used Fly and flew in the direction where targets were concentrated, unleashing Wave.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dozens of targets exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there was a limit to his mana.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had the God Hands continue to handle the targets and dropped to the ground after his mana was depleted.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Korean viewers who saw it were frustrated.&nbsp;</span><span style>The targets were difficult to deal with from the ground and South Korea only had one ranged damage dealer, Yura, so the US team was able to catch up.&nbsp;</span><span style>Maybe Russia and Canada would also catch up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But who was Grid?&nbsp;</span><span style>He was a legendary blacksmith that could use all weapons. He had acquired the Weapons Mastery skill in the Behen Archipelago.&nbsp;</span><span style>The commentators and viewers were shocked as they saw him take out a bow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Bow? Why is he bringing out a bow? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Don’t tell me... Surely a blacksmith isn’t trying to shoot a bow... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagma was a legendary blacksmith and great swordsman.&nbsp;</span><span style>Everyone could understand why Pagma’s Descendant would use a sword, but they never imagined that he could shoot a bow.</span></p>
