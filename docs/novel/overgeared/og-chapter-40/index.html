 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>It had been two hours since the item production game started.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was around the time that the crowd was losing interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>While Euphemina had already finished the blade and had moved on to the hilt, I hadn’t even finished the outline of the blade yet. I continued to temper the iron.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to Khan helping me pinch the metal with his tongs, I was able to become more involved in the hammering and forging.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Patience skill has been activated. Concentration, stamina, and defense will rise to the extremes for one hour.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A notification window popped up as I was concentrating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>At the same time, I was able to exert an aura of sharp concentrating, making my hammer strikes more powerful and elaborate.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of cheering was completely diminished.&nbsp;</span><span style>I forgot that this was Winston’s Central Square that contained thousands of people. Even Khan’s helping presence became blurred.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was quiet.&nbsp;</span><span style>The only thing that existed in this world was the iron.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttaang - ttang -</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The hammer and I weren’t separate entities. We were fully fused. There was no resistance in the movements of the hammer. It followed my will as if it was part of my body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The metal made a clear sound as it was shaped like a blade.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then a notification window flashed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath has increased the effectiveness of your production items]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"......!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>My spirit cleared and the calm world suddenly changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Erina! Erina! Erina!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Khan, fighting!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I believe in Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd cheered, the birds chirped on the fence, the second hand of the clock tower ticked, and the hammering of Erina were all types of noises that could be heard from the other side of the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My consciousness was dissatisfied as I returned from my own world. It was like reality was intruding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I wanted to remain there a little bit longer.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Too bad.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the first time since the creation of the Jaffa Arrow that I became so immersed in the production process.&nbsp;</span><span style>If I could remain in that world a little more, I thought I could create a better work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As I felt regret, Khan’s trembling voice was heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I never thought iron could be so beautiful...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now I had finished the blade.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then I saw it.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was flawlessly sophisticated, more beautiful than any artwork!&nbsp;</span><span style>The eyes of a legendary blacksmith shouted.&nbsp;</span><span style>This work was more outstanding than the Special Jaffa Arrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“G-Great... amazing! To think I am able to enjoy the glory of helping with this work! I think that I was born to become a blacksmith just for this day!”&nbsp;</span><span style>Khan excitedly exclaimed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But I remained calm. It was because I couldn’t ruin the remaining processes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Inventory."</span></p>
 <p><span style>I took out a minotaur horn from my inventory.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was why I spent a huge amount of 10 gold before the match.&nbsp;</span><span style>I would make a sheath and hilt with this horn.&nbsp;</span><span style>The sheath could be used as a defensive tool depending on the situation, so it was better to have a proper weight and rigidity. The hilt had to be relatively soft to minimize the fatigue of the user.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The minotaur’s horn was robust and durable, but it was surprisingly soft. It had the texture of brass casting.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, it was suitable to be used for the sheath and hilt.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seuk seuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>First, the sheath was designed based on the size of the blade while the length, width, and shape of the hilt were based on an adult male’s hand.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was completely practical.&nbsp;</span><span style>The minotaur’s horn had an artistic pattern on it, so they showed an artistry without me having to do anything.&nbsp;</span><span style>After finishing the design, I was focused on the production when I heard a tremendous cry from the stands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erina had completed the dagger one step ahead of me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The host checked her dagger and was impressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is a really great work! Making this in less than three hours, I can only admire this wonderful work! Now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What type of work was created that could cause such surprise?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don’t look alone. Show it to us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd was in an uproar as they were curious about the finished work.&nbsp;</span><span style>After the host confirmed that their curiosity reached the peak, he focused the crowd’s attention on the display board installed at the back of the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay! Check it out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the display board, Erina’s dagger appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was very sharp yet had a great balance.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a superior dagger that would be able to exert an exceptional attack power. The handle was made of brass casting with a beautiful pattern engraved on it, making it a beautiful ornament as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ohhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The dagger resembles the owner! I have never seen such a pretty dagger. I want to see!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is a secondary matter. The performance is extraordinary just looking at it. I really want it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd was enthusiastic. Now it wasn’t just the men showing a favorable opinion towards Erina, but the female users as well.&nbsp;</span><span style>The detailed information of the dagger appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Dagger of Bewitchment]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 60/60 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 122~127 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Speed: +8%</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a certain probability of bewitching the enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The durability will be quickly consumed when blocking an attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dagger produced using the delicate skills and superior aesthetics of an excellent blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lethal beauty can sometimes steal other people’s hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sharp blade has a high attack power, but the drawback is that it lacks robustness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>User Restriction: Level 100 or higher. More than 200 agility.&nbsp;</span><span style>More than 30 strength. Intermediate Dagger Mastery.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The disadvantage was its durability, but this was a truly excellent dagger.&nbsp;</span><span style>The attack power was incomparable to a common dagger. It also had the bewitchment option.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bewitchment was a powerful skill that turned a target into a non-resistant state for three seconds. It was appropriate as an assassin’s weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The users were convinced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The result is clear! Erina definitely won this game!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the Winston residents felt desperate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah... that woman is a great blacksmith. Grid is a blacksmith recognized by Khan, but is it possible for him to create something better?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit and the other Mero Company officials looked convinced that victory was in their grasp.&nbsp;</span><span style>But I didn’t shake.&nbsp;</span><span style>Khan was the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style>“That girl has tremendous skills for her young age. They are excited right now. But it won’t be like that in the future. Isn't that right?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sheath and hilt were finished.&nbsp;</span><span style>I nodded as they were combined with the blade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Of course. I represent the ugly people of the world. I will never stop.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Represent the ugly people? What does that mean? You are fighting on behalf of the smithy, the smithy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Ah, excuse me. I forgot. Now, shall we go and keep the smithy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dagger was completed.&nbsp;</span><span style>I was thrilled to see the information about the dagger and showed my dagger to the host.&nbsp;</span><span style>The host didn’t even look at my dagger properly as he spoke to the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This team spent a lot more time than Erina, despite having two people. He can’t hide the fact that the result of this game is too obvious!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha! Yes! It is shameful for two men to go against a woman, but it has come to an end!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I scoffed at all of them.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Look at my work and be careful not to have heart attacks from shock.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment.&nbsp;</span><span style>Soldiers armed with swords and spears climbed onto the stage. Then they confiscated my dagger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As I was confused, a heavily armed knight shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have received information that you are working with a criminal called Huroi, arrested eight days ago for trying to harm Winston! You’ll have to be questioned about this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huroi?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was he talking about Huroi who received the ‘For the Residents of Winston’ quest? He was captured and failed the quest?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘That useless bastard. No... why am I associated with him?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I resisted.&nbsp;</span><span style>“What are you saying? I don’t know that person! Let me go!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The knight pulled out his sword at my defiance and warned me,&nbsp;</span><span style>“I suggest that you don’t resist.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If I did something, this bastard really would kill me. A sword was pointed at my neck!&nbsp;</span><span style>I was unarmed and forced to follow as the soldiers dragged me down the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan called out.&nbsp;</span><span style>“What are you doing? Why are you unfairly framing a person?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The knights and soldiers ignored Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Khan eventually ran to where the Mero officials were sitting. Then he shouted to someone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Valmont! You cowardly wretch! You know that you won’t win the game, so you are trying to finish it in this manner! You aren’t afraid of the Winston residents?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Khan’s shouting was useless.&nbsp;</span><span style>The middle-aged man didn’t respond as if he was just hearing an annoying dog’s barks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, I was brought by the armed forces to the castle.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is impossible!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit had spent 20 years as a merchant. In the meantime, he had handled numerous excellent products.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s why he was astonished the moment he checked the dagger made by Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This isn’t an ordinary item! Erina’s dagger can’t be compared to it. We... we lost. I didn’t think he would have that much skill!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Valmont, sitting beside him, muttered in an angry voice.&nbsp;</span><span style>“We lost.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Valmont also noticed it right away when he saw Grid’s dagger. His eyes were as good as Rabbit’s when it came to seeing spectacular items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit bowed.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I’m sorry. I should’ve been more vigilant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Valmont forgave him for failing this time. There was no choice.&nbsp;</span><span style>“It isn’t your fault. You hired an amazing blacksmith. But the opponent was too strong. It is different from his appearance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Valmont had declared their victory when he first saw Grid. He guessed Grid was just a lowly blacksmith. But the result was clear and simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>This failure couldn’t be blamed on Rabbit. Grid was just an amazing person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He disguised himself as a trash person so that he could make his opponent underestimate him... He really isn’t stupid. This competition needs to be properly handled. How can I accept this result?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Valmont wanted the smithy. It wasn’t acceptable for a merchant to give up on the profit from the smithy because of a game.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit tried to persuade him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>"But we have already publicly announced this. If we don’t accept the result, the public sentiment will be irreversible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Valmont raised his voice.&nbsp;</span><span style>“You are speaking nonsense. I will absolutely never give up the smithy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit could no longer stop Valmont. How could he be so confident in this bad situation? There must be something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Valmont smiled wickedly.&nbsp;</span><span style>“In the first place, the crowd doesn’t know the result yet. Unlike us, they don’t have the discerning eye to see that it is a great item. Unless the details are checked, it is impossible to know that Grid’s dagger is far superior to Erina’s dagger. Sir Philipson!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Philipson was the knight of Baron Lowe, the lord of Winston, and he was here as Valmont’s escort.&nbsp;</span><span style>It clearly showed how great Valmont’s current position in Winston was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Valmont gave an order to Philipson.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Arrest him right away on charges of being the friend of Huroi, who was caught recently. You must confiscate the dagger that he made. This information of that dagger must not be disclosed to the public!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Philipson’s soldiers intruded on the stage. They quickly seized the dagger and arrested Grid.</span></p>
