 <p><span style>‘Did he forget about me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The great magician Braham.&nbsp;</span><span style>Much longer than a year ago, he had commissioned Grid to make him a Vessel of the Soul.&nbsp;</span><span style>A Vessel of the Soul was necessary for his resurrection.&nbsp;</span><span style>But until now, there was no news from Grid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Based on the little he observed through Mumud’s Orb, Grid seemed to have no desire to fulfill the request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He plans to take all the pavranium!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham had reached the limits of his patience.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had sent a golem army as a warning.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, things didn’t work out and Braham’s anger skyrocketed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Pagma's Descendant...!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The expression of a soul’s emotions was honest.&nbsp;</span><span style>His soul fragments scattered throughout the continent simultaneously turned red.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was someone who found one of the soul pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first vampire city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh my? I feel a dirty magic power, who is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The wards were easily cracked and a mysterious woman appeared in front of Braham’s soul.&nbsp;</span><span style>The magic power that could be seen inside her was tremendous, like the light from a dragon heart. It was enough to make even Braham nervous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Y-You...!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A black-haired beauty who exuded gentleness and sensuality.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was so beautiful that it was unrealistic, but Braham’s soul shook frantically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Marie Rose! How did you escape from your seal?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vampire duke, Marie Rose.&nbsp;</span><span style>A direct descendant of the founder Shizo Beriache and the one with the strongest magic power, she directly grabbed Braham’s soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was able to break the seal at any time. I was just bored and enjoyed sleeping.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then she woke up due to the bloody smell coming from a human male’s cloak.&nbsp;</span><span style>Marie Rose’s eyes curved into a crescent moon shape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Braham, you lost your pure blood and degenerated, eventually dying. Now only your soul is left. This insignificant appearance suits you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Don’t taunt me!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marie Rose gazed at Braham’s soul, which was gradually turning redder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Our Braham wouldn’t have no countermeasures. What are you planning to do now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marie Rose handled Braham’s soul like it was clay, then she suddenly smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a brilliant smile that was enough to illuminate the dark city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You, are you dreaming about resurrection?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham was a peculiar presence.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t rely on the innate power of the clan and explored magic power.&nbsp;</span><span style>He might’ve completed the resurrection magic.&nbsp;</span><span style>Braham didn’t deny it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Then what are you going to do? You can’t stop my resurrection! If even one of my souls hidden in all parts of the continent doesn’t disappear, I will someday be fully resurrected! Then I will surely use all my effort to destroy you!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marie Rose found the shouting soul to be cute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I wonder how far you can go as a mortal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[...!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mortal!&nbsp;</span><span style>Braham hated that cursed word.&nbsp;</span><span style>Marie Rose returned the soul to its original position and turned around.&nbsp;</span><span style>Braham called out to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Aren’t you going to destroy my soul fragment here?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham had been banished from the clan.&nbsp;</span><span style>He used the fact that it was dark to hide his soul in the clan’s cities, but he thought they would be destroyed because they were found by Marie Rose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Marie Rose had no intention of dealing with Braham.&nbsp;</span><span style>Braham was a mere worm in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How annoying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marie Rose immediately returned to her palace.&nbsp;</span><span style>Braham’s soul looked like a flame as he watched her leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This mutation that transcends the founder...!’&nbsp;</span><span style>He must be resurrected.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘I will kill the one who made me like this, take away the their heart, and regain eternal life!’</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Winston had problems.&nbsp;</span><span style>As it grew into the second largest city in the north, all types of groups infiltrated it and problems occurred.&nbsp;</span><span style>Various forces were created and confronted each other, causing the deterioration of security.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Lady Irene needs to recover...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>After entering the sixth month of her pregnancy, Irene became depressed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her only flesh and blood, her father, was at Frontier, and her husband Grid was in Reidan, so she was alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sigh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wrinkled face sighed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Winston’s chief knight, Phoenix, was now old.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was too much for him to supervise the work that Irene was supposed to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If only Grid was here.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Phoenix was sighing over a pile of documents, when an urgent voice was heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Captain Phoenix! Blood is being shed in Rein!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rein was the name of a bar in the slums.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a place filled with many crooks that disturbed security.&nbsp;</span><span style>Phoenix’s face twisted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who is causing trouble?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Double-Billed Merchant Group and the Yellow Guild are colliding!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Double-Billed Merchant Group had a tight grip on Winston’s market.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Recently, they started to buy orc leather and collided with the Ikeil Merchant Group as they expanded their business. The Ikeil Group seemed to have hired the Yellow Guild to attack the the Double-Billed Merchant Group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Those Yellow bastards!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Yellow Guild was a powerful group.&nbsp;</span><span style>The average level was close to 200 and they were the strongest guild in Winston.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to suppress them, Phoenix had to go out himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let's go!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Phoenix was accompanied by soldiers and knights.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"The strongest knight in the north isn’t that great?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rein Tavern.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dozens of people watched as Phoenix fell to his knees.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was badly hit by the Yellow Guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Phoenix gritted his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was glaring at a priest of the Rebecca Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong Pao.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Rebecca Church priest, who once enjoyed PKing with Shay’s group, recently added his strength to the Yellow Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, it was due to money.&nbsp;</span><span style>How wonderful and happy was it to earn money by playing games?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is a tip.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The master of the Yellow Guild, Ank, threw a purse towards Dong Pao.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the payment for approaching Phoenix as a Rebecca priest and distracting him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dong Pao smiled with satisfaction after confirming the amount.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good, good. Don’t forget to kill all the witnesses just in case.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ank had no intention of sparing Phoenix and his men.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was he scared by the penalty of killing the knights and soldiers?&nbsp;</span><span style>He could take the chance.&nbsp;</span><span style>He planned to leave the Eternal Kingdom after this work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If only I can obtain the Sword of Self-transcendence!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sword of Self-transcendence.&nbsp;</span><span style>A legendary item that was supposed produced by Grid during his novice days.&nbsp;</span><span style>The expected selling price was 1.5 million gold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No, the number of users who are level 180 have increased recently, so it will go over 2 million if I put it on auction.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an amount that could reverse his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can go drink with girls!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, it was a low level of greed.&nbsp;</span><span style>The joyful Ank approached Phoenix.&nbsp;</span><span style>Phoenix was in a miserable condition.&nbsp;</span><span style>He fell into a trap and struggled against 40 Yellow Guild members alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>More than half of the guild members had died, so the price wasn’t cheap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Please drop the Sword of Self-transcendence after dying.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ssik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ank said with a smile.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he could get money, he wouldn’t feel guilty for killing NPCs.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ank was a man who didn’t care about killing.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Swaeek!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The moment that a vicious sword was able to stab into Phoenix’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A golden blade flew and stabbed Ank in the neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 3,900 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A throwing weapon could cause him that much damage?&nbsp;</span><span style>Ank turned his gaze in the direction where the blade was thrown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Where is this fellow?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The answer came from behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Guess."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 11,900 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is crazy!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why was this attack power so strong?&nbsp;</span><span style>The astonished Ank looked at the greatsword that was stabbed in his side.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a blue greatsword that reminded him of the predator of the sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘D-Don’t tell me!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ank turned pale and looked back. Then it was like he saw a ghost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why was he here in the north when he should be in the west?&nbsp;</span><span style>Ank and the other Yellow Guild members couldn’t believe it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid swung the greatsword at those who were speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"These cheeky bastards, how dare you mess around in my wife’s territory?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peok!</span></i> <i><span style>Puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The one-sided assault wasn’t even worth describing.&nbsp;</span><span style>Users in the early 200’s couldn’t stand up to Grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"G-Grid, it has been a long time since I’ve seen you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong Pao, who was hiding in the corner, awkwardly greeted Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The scammer started to act.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Today I was moved by the guidance of Goddess Rebecca. I happened to be reunited by you in this place! Grid! I have been repenting since I first met you, but then I was taken hostage by these villainous people and used! You have saved me, so I should repay this grace...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong Pao was embarrassed by the unexpected question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y-You don’t remember me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, I can’t remember you because my brain capacity isn’t good enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-What are you saying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shut up.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peok!</span></i> <i><span style>Bam bam bam!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuheook!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On this day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Yellow Guild and Dong Pao, who was beaten up like a dog, were deprived of their citizenship. Now they couldn’t step anywhere in the Steim territory.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were also sentenced to two weeks of Satisfy time in prison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was frustrating for a user to be imprisoned for two weeks.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, Dong Pao felt the desire to quit the game because his work had been ruined twice by Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I need to set up security straight away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid received a report on the statue of Winston from Phoenix and immediately summoned Jude.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jude was very strong after being armed with Dainsleif and the best armor. His level was above Phoenix, who was no longer developing due to his age.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teach the soldiers here and punish those who cause disturbances without any mercy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jude had no thoughts.&nbsp;</span><span style>He just followed Grid’s orders.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Winston soldiers had to taste hell from Jude’s harsh training.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were deserters and wounded soldiers as a result, but the few soldiers who endured the training could become elites.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jude rallied the soldiers and quickly stabilized Winston’s security.</span></p>
