 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>[Please design the item.]</p>
 <p><span style>A blank blueprint appeared in front of me.&nbsp;</span><span style>I was baffled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Design? How do I do that?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I then knew what I should have done.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rather than visualize modern weapons such tanks and jet fighters, I needed to design a sword. Wasn’t it just a matter of the shape?&nbsp;</span><span style>I thought hard and started drawing on the blueprint with my finger. A correction effect seemed to be applied, as the picture perfectly displayed my thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to make it cool.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>First, the length of the blade was 2m and the width was 80cm. The thickness was 8cm. The length of the handle was set at 40cm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...This is the appearance of a greatsword that can be seen anywhere.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The finished picture showed the limits of my impoverished imagination.&nbsp;</span><span style>I pondered for a moment before thinking of a good idea.&nbsp;</span><span style>I changed the shape of the blade to something curved like a scimitar and then extended the length of the blade to 3m.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I liked the finished picture. It was like I was looking at a large scimitar with a short handle. At the same time, it had the heavy weight of a greatsword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is reminiscent of a shark’s profile. The part of the blade is like a shark fin, and the end of the handle is a shark tail.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I admired the finished work for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I have made something sophisticated and cool!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It gave the impression of a swimming shark.&nbsp;</span><span style>If I held it, some people might have the mistaken impression that I was carrying a shark and be shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I didn’t know I would be so good at designing. Once I make money and pay back the debt, I should change my major to design.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I felt great satisfaction as I clicked on the OK button at the bottom of the blueprint.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Have you decided? When you complete the blueprint, the number of available creations from the creation skill will decrease by one.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once I replied, numbers and languages quickly covered the blueprint.&nbsp;</span><span style>Figures were being calculated. It seemed that the system was calculating the details that I lacked in my design.&nbsp;</span><span style>After a while, an improved and completed design appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>A bunch of Jargon and complicated numbers covered the blueprint.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>I could fully understand the jargon and numbers on the blueprint. I looked at the design contents and checked if there were any faults.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was amazing. I understood that contents of an item design that I had never even seen or studied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'The class compensation effect!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was really great; I felt like an actual great blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span style>As I was admiring it, a notification window popped up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Please describe the characteristics of the item.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right! Finally, the most important part is left!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is an outstanding weapon. The attack power is one million... no, it is more than 10 million and the weight is only one. There is no level requirement. There is an option to absorb health with every attack. Can cause meteors to fall. The enemy will unconditionally die from one hit. Of course, defense is ignored. Anyway, this weapon is enough to hunt a dragon alone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[That isn’t possible. The performance and options of an item can’t be arbitrarily set. The performance and options are determined by taking into account the materials used, the design, and the description of the features.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>...Too bad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I tried to make the explanation as good as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is a greatsword, but thanks to its unusual shape, its cutting power is tremendous. The protruding part that resembles a shark’s fin will allow for unexpected attacks, and can even go through armor. Blue orichalcum is used as the material, so it is light and durable. And... and... um... well, that will be enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was my vocabulary so lacking? I was horribly ashamed.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the first place, I only knew that blue orichalcum was light and durable. I didn’t know the exact information, so I can’t explain the merits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then... just...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, I felt like the back of my head was hit with a hammer.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a belated epiphany but if I was designing this with blue orichalcum as the material, wouldn’t I need blue orichalcum to make the item?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m screwed.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A level 200 boss monster dropped the material, while I was only level -3.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>I could buy it from other people, but that wasn’t easy because the supply was small and the price was huge.&nbsp;</span><span style>It meant the design I made could become obsolete!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cancel! Skill cancel! Clear everything!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The completion of the blueprint has already destroyed one of the available creation skill users. Even if you cancel the skill now, the number of times it can be used won’t be restored. Do you still want to cancel it?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was bad. It was a mistake in my thinking. It was a skill that should be used carefully after thorough investigation and thinking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Please name the item.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhh... shit...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Have you decided on ‘Uhhshit?’]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What nonsense are you saying? Please wait! Geez, what is this?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>I didn’t worry about it for too long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Failure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Have you decided on ‘Failure?’]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, it was a failure that shouldn’t have been created in the first place.&nbsp;</span><span style>I was saddened at the number of times I could use the skill decreasing, but a hologram of the items was listed in the drafts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Failure]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Unique ~ Legendary</span></p>
 <p><em><span style>Unique Rating Information:</span></em></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 699/699 &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attack Power: 733~1,621 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 50</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Agility +30</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a low probability of blocking the enemy’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a certain probability of activating the ‘5 Joint Attacks’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a high probability of activating the ‘Cutting’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There will be a fear effect if the enemy is more than 20 levels lower than the user.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Attack power +20% in dark places. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em><span style>Legendary Rating Information:</span></em></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 1,090/1,090 &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attack Power: 874~1,820 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 80</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Agility +50</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a low probability of blocking the enemy’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a certain probability of activating the ‘5 Joint Attack’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a high probability of activating the ‘Cutting’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The skill ‘Bisect’ will be created.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There will be a fear effect if the enemy is more than 20 levels lower than the user.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Attack power +20% in dark places.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is designed by a legendary blacksmith. It is a greatsword, but its cutting ability is excellent because of its unique shape. It resembles the predator of the sea, a shark, and gives fear to the enemies. The small blades spiking from the sword will increase the defense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blue orichalcum is used as a material. Its lightness means the attack speed doesn’t fall. Due to the nature of the blue orichalcum, it becomes stronger in the dark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>User Restriction: Level 300 or higher. More than 5,000 strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Advanced Sword Mastery level 8 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 550&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Hiccup!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amazing. It was a master weapon, not a failure. A one of a kind item in this world. And I was the one who created this item. I couldn’t believe it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isn’t this huge?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The words automatically emerged from my stunned mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yes, I could be rich.&nbsp;</span><span style>If I went into more debt and bought blue orichalcum, I could make ‘Failure’ and put it on the trading site. Then the price of the item would skyrocket.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then I could pay all my debts and still have a lot of money left!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Truly a legendary blacksmith!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It was literally the goose that laid the golden egg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Uh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then that feeling sank as I read the stats and options of the completed ‘Failure’.&nbsp;</span><span style>I checked the usage conditions attached at the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It needs level 300?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two days ago, I heard that the level of the first ranked person on the unified rankings was estimated to be around 250.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Then 300?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>That wasn’t the only problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“5,000 strength?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>10 stat points were gained with every level.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even if a person invested all of their points into strength for every level up, it would be almost impossible to have 5,000 strength at level 300, even with titles and equipment that raised their stats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There are classes that receive extra strength, but it isn’t common. In the first place, who would be idiotic enough to invest all of their points in strength?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, there was the Advanced Sword Mastery level 8.&nbsp;</span><span style>Currently, the first ranked blacksmith had intermediate level skills. I couldn’t predict how long it would take for people to get Advanced Sword Master level 8.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if I managed to make ‘Failure’, nobody would be able to use it in the near future. This meant that selling it was impossible.&nbsp;</span><span style>My dream of making a fortune was shattered in an instant.&nbsp;</span><span style>As the name suggested, ‘Failure’ was a failure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Then that’s it. There is no springtime in my life. Shit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was frustrated but quickly corrected my mindset. Then I tried to deduce why such exorbitant usage conditions were attached to the item I created.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t difficult to come to a conclusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It was a mistake to try and make it unconditionally good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The development team of Satisfy had caught the hearts of the world, so they wouldn’t be that easy.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘Failure’ wasn’t an item that could be acquired randomly through hunting or a raid. It was a production item that could be produced indefinitely if there were enough materials.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was likely that the system placed restrictions on the game items in order to maintain the game balance. Those restrictions were in the usage conditions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘An acceptable performance. Isn’t this the most important thing about the creative skills?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The creation skill had a limited number of uses. It had to be used with care.&nbsp;</span><span style>I decided to seal the creation skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>If I created and sold superior items that didn’t destroy the balance, I would be able to earn a lot of money quickly and pay off my debt. However, I didn’t want to rush it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I wanted to see it as the ultimate weapon to use for myself before encountering a difficult quest or a strong enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The creation skill is for me. If I am in a crisis situation, I can create an item that can break through the situation.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a simple example, if I encountered a boss monster capable of causing tremendous fire damage, I could create and build an item that greatly increased my fire resistance properties before the raid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If I didn’t create items for sale, I didn’t have to worry about the usage conditions. One of the biggest advantages of Pagma’s Descendant was that there was no restriction on the items I could wear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>If I created items with a fraudulent power like ‘Failure’, I could show the highest power among existing items, even if the penalty was attached.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>After I cleared my mind, I checked how to make ‘Failure.’&nbsp;</span><span style>The materials were also a problem.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to produce ‘Failure’, I needed a huge supply 15 blue orichalcum ore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Even the handle is made with blue orichalcum... It was a mistake to choose only blue orichalcum as the material. If I used other materials as well, the number of blue orichalcum ore required would be reduced.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I saw Failure’s tremendous options, so I was filled with the desire to produce and use it right away. If I could get my hands on Failure, I would be able to demonstrate a fearful combat power. But it was impossible to obtain blue orichalcum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Let’s get rid of this vain regret. No, wait. Can I participate in the Guardian of the Forest raid party? The person recruiting party members said that level was irrelevant.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I remembered the Guardian of the Forest raid party and headed back to the center of the square. Then I walked up to the black man with the ID ‘Toban’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I would like to participate in the raid.”</span></p>
