 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Duke Grid still hasn’t learned of my father’s illness. The proof of this is that Reidan’s army is still weak, so we must strike against Reidan at this time. There won’t be another chance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>1st Prince Ren was well aware of how strong Grid and his subordinates were. It was natural, since he’d witnessed their actions in the Reinhardt golem invasion.&nbsp;</span><span style>Nevertheless, the reason he was hostile to Grid was firstly, it was obvious that Ren would be eaten up if he stayed still. Secondly, he believed in the power of his warriors, including Hurent. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The contents of the linked quest was being updated in front of Hurent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Prince of the Eternal Kingdom - Chapter IV-]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level of Difficulty: Not measurable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>1st Prince Ren has seen the strength of aura and has absolute confidence in you. He believes that you are the only rival for Duke Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Advance to Reidan with Ren’s army!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strike down hard on Duke Grid, who is making fun of the royal family!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Conditions: Occupy Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Rewards: Ren will be crowned king and you will gain the title of Merit King. If you establish a kingdom, special benefits will be given.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Failure: Unpredictable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Would you like to accept the quest?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was impossible to measure the degree of difficulty.&nbsp;</span><span style>Quests with users as the target often couldn’t guess the difficulty or consequences.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent smiled and nodded without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I am willing to help you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was around 10 months ago in real time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent had been humiliated after losing to Grid in just 5 seconds. It was also in front of the entire world.&nbsp;</span><span style>How much contempt had he received since then?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m going to regain my honor with this quest.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Merit King?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was just minor title.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent wanted to regain the title of the strongest, and he believed that he was now qualified.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid, I will show you the true power of an aura master. It will be in front of the whole world!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>His efforts over the past 10 months would cause a disaster.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Garosu-gil Road during autumn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What exactly is a pet master?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the festival was over.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo went to a restaurant with Sehee, Yerim, and Doohyun.&nbsp;</span><span style>Doohyun explained to Youngwoo after ordering the food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can look at it as an enhanced version of a monster tamer. I can train monsters to act as pets or temporarily take away another person’s pet. I can also buff my pets and your pets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buff fellow pets?&nbsp;</span><span style>Even the strongest buffer, Huroi couldn’t do this. Huroi could only give buffs to his own pet.&nbsp;</span><span style>Furthermore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Take away another person’s pet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I can command the pets. The duration is a minimum of 15 seconds and it can go up to 50 seconds.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Can the pets that you command use their skills?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a scam.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t an exaggeration.&nbsp;</span><span style>Taking an enemy’s pet and using their original abilities?&nbsp;</span><span style>It would consume the mana of the pet and hit the enemy.&nbsp;</span><span style>If the pet possessed a buffing skill, it could be used on allies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyway, it was very useful. This could be a great advantage in combat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But the real power of a pet master is something else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doohyun was speaking many words, unlike his usual self.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was it due to the beautiful Sehee and Yerim?&nbsp;</span><span style>Not at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Doohyun was only looking at Youngwoo. To be precise, he was excited about meeting Youngwoo’s pet, Noe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your true ability?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I can check the details of the targeted pet. It means I can quickly grasp the stats, skills, weaknesses and advantages of the pet. Also.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Also?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo’s eyes lit up.&nbsp;</span><span style>The better Overgeared became, the happier he was.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was full of expectations for what Kim Doohyun called the ultimate advantage of a pet master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I have the pet beauty ability.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Beauty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, so please introduce me to Noe. If I can, I will make Noe more beautiful. I want to be Noe’s private hairdresser!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A unique hidden class was dreaming of being a hairdresser?&nbsp;</span><span style>It seemed like this new member also wasn’t normal.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo recalled something that Vantner said about the Tzedakah Guild in the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"By the way, it looks like the people who joined the guild after Grid aren’t normal. A crazy person attracts other crazy people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is it me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He belatedly realized that Yerim was holding some rolled pasta to his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about it? Is it delicious?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo was surprised and told the truth,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Not so much. It is too salty so I would rather buy two cups of ramyun.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The food that a sexy woman like me is giving you isn’t delicious?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What sexy woman...? You aren’t sexy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aish~ even with this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hik! Don’t do that in a public place!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid, this person.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doohyun realized it as he saw Youngwoo sitting between Yerim and Sehee.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo was the true high school girl killer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But where did Peak Sword go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Towards the end of the meal.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yerim had an afterthought.&nbsp;</span><span style>Until now, they had completely forgotten about Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s probably out there playing around.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword, who receive the stigma of a sexual harasser due to Youngwoo!&nbsp;</span><span style>He had been chased after by security guards for hours.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[Mass Production Grid Set]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It consisted of weapons, helmet, armor, gloves and shoes.&nbsp;</span><span style>The weapons were one-handed swords, spears, bows, and shields, and Grid designed them with the intention of giving them to the soldiers of Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had an excellent performance and the effect when worn as a set was great, compared to other equipment of the same level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there was a problem.&nbsp;</span><span style>The level restriction was 160.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Reidan’s soldiers were level 133, so the equipment couldn’t be distributed immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But the performance will go down if the level limit is lowered too much.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>What should he do?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid thought about it and summoned Piaro and Asmophel.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro and Asmophel blinked after they came running at Grid’s call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beside Reidan’s outer walls.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was sitting in front of a portable furnace and making items, while four golden hands were hunting monsters near him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘However, the level is still low.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The giant worms were very weak monsters, based on Piaro and Asmophel’s standards.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were able to cut the giant worms easily, and it would be the same if Duke Grid used a skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then what about these golden hands?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The four hands joined forces, but it took them more than four minutes to hunt a giant worm. They couldn’t take the initiative when fighting.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was strange that swords were moving on their own, but it wasn’t that scary when looking closely. The only point worth paying attention to was the exceptional speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Piaro appreciated the potential of the golden hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They’re much better than when I fought him. I’m looking forward to how they grow in the future.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid asked Piaro and Asmophel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How long does it take for the soldiers to gain one level?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Currently, it’s five days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The level up speed was much faster than expected.&nbsp;</span><span style>Considering that the level of the Winston soldiers remained in the 80’s for several months, the soldiers of Reidan were raising their levels at a phenomenal rate.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a glimpse of Piaro and Asmophel’s outstanding training methods, who were once destined to be the pillars of the empire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then the soldiers will reach level 160 in five months?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asmophel answered without hesitation.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was so confident that Grid couldn’t help feeling greedy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Can you raise their level faster?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The intensity of the training is already very high. If we overwork the soldiers, they might be injured and there will be many complaints.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Does it matter as long as they don’t die? And so what about complaints? A soldier needs to do this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had experience being a soldier in the South Korean army.&nbsp;</span><span style>High intensity training?&nbsp;</span><span style>As long as they didn’t die, they would eventually adapt. And if they worked hard, they would be too tired to complain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes? Let’s do it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro and Asmophel swore allegiance to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had a obligation to follow him, even if it was a somewhat difficult command.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, the soldiers of Reidan had to suffer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Run! Roll! Gear up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stab! Shoot! Cut! Chop!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro and Asmophel showed no mercy.&nbsp;</span><span style>The 1,000 soldiers of Reidan had to endure harsh training every day until their muscles screamed.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a result, the level up speed of the soldiers increased from 1.3 times to 1.5 times.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The loyalty of Reidan’s soldiers has dropped by 9.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Reidan’s soldiers don’t respect you.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was the target of the soldiers’ resentment.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was very serious from a ruler’s point of view.&nbsp;</span><span style>If the loyalty of soldiers towards the lord was lowered, it was difficult to restore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Grid wasn’t shaken.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Every day and night without covering production and mass production-type grid set.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid knew that the soldiers’ respect and loyalty would rise again the day the Grid set was distributed to them.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Irene’s due date was in five days.&nbsp;</span><span style>Because of this, one of the main powers of the Eternal Kingdom and ruler of the north, Marquis Steim visited Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Welcome, father-in-law.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh! The duke came out to meet me, I’m so flattered!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marquis Steim’s eyes were bright as he looked at Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>He only knew Reidan as a ghost town, but it had developed quickly after Grid became the lord.&nbsp;</span><span style>The population was still only 20,000, but it was excellent compared to other cities in the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, it was unchallenged when it came to agriculture.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even the Saharan Empire didn’t have such a great agricultural city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m amazed at the level of determination to develop an agricultural city in the middle of the desert!’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, his son-in-law was great.&nbsp;</span><span style>Marquis Steim smiled proudly.</span></p>
