 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you okay?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will be better after drinking some potions.” Peak Sword smiled and waved his hand at the anxious Grid. His bright smile made Grid’s expression darker. The dead could revive and slight wounds could be healed, but it was still painful. There might be a set limit to pain in the game, but Grid still wasn’t willing to accept it. It was why many of the two billion players preferred non-combat classes or chose archers, magicians, etc.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“...Don’t overdo it next time,” Grid declared coldly. It was intended to hide his feelings, but it couldn’t be hidden. Peak Sword knew Grid’s nature because he was Grid’s first fan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">Ah</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, really. A person who dies every day is sensitive about someone’s hand being damaged.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is at least a month before I die. What is every day? Additionally, it doesn’t hurt after death but a fracture is very painful.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is a problem for us when you die, whether it is once a month or every day. I know. I know. I understand so lose that expression. God Grid, stop worrying.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the end, Grid smiled at Peak Sword who surrendered and then looked at the shining stone in his hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Fire Stone Filled with the Breath of the Fire Dragon]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Rating: Myth</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A mineral that was born after ingesting Fire Dragon Trauka’s breath for 200 years.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">An unnamed miner risked his life and succeeded in mining it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Weight: 10]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Why did only one fire stone grow in that huge lair?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The dragon’s breath sometimes changes the nature of matter. However, most substances can’t bear the change in nature and will be destroyed. This one was able to hold on,” Braham explained the reason and tapped the fire stone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was an admiring attitude. The myth-rated mineral was remarkable even to Braham.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘What type of sword will be born?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The unfortunate part was that it wasn’t ‘iron’ but ‘stone.’ This wasn’t the stone age so the value of stone-made equipment was bound to be low. However, Grid was a legendary blacksmith. He didn’t blame the materials. He had to use his skills to sharpen the stone so it was like steel. A fire stone with the breath of the fire dragon, who had existed since the beginning...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll focus on working on it for the next few days.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grid had no worries now that he knew he could come and go from Talima at any time. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Peak Sword cheered on Grid who headed straight for the smithy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It is completely different from when I came previously?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was Jishuka’s impression when she came to the East Continent after a long time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The people of the Cho Kingdom used to be anxious and wary toward the foreigners from the West Continent. Now they were full of energy. No matter where she went, they treated the players kindly and welcomed them. Thus, she wondered if this was Grid’s power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Grid, you’ve changed the world while I’ve been trying to gain a few levels.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was truly a great person. He deserved her love. Jishuka smiled happily as she quickened her pace. She arrived at the capital of the Cho Kingdom in just two days.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I will take a day off before leaving.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She still had a long way to go. Jishuka’s destination was the Xing Kingdom. Her quest was to find the ‘Breaking Evil Arrow’ at the shrine here.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;‘I don’t know why I should get it.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Breaking Evil Arrow, as the name suggested, was an arrow that destroyed unclean beings. In other words, it was an arrow that dealt additional damage to existences such as undead, ghosts, and demonkin. Jishuka wasn’t satisfied. Mithril arrows that were fatal to the undead and demonkin were already popular in the West Continent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Of course, the Breaking Evil Arrow has a higher concept than the mithril arrows.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She was told it was a divine arrow. The Breaking Evil Arrow would naturally be better than the mithril arrow. However, was it better than the mithril arrows used by Jishuka? Jishuka wasn’t convinced that this was the case. It was because she currently wasn’t using normal mithril arrows, but instead mithril arrows made by Grid. It was impossible to be fascinated with the Breaking Evil Arrows from Jishuka’s position when she already had mithril arrows three times more powerful than normal mithril arrows.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She didn’t feel good because she needed to waste a few days obtaining the arrows. She would’ve quit the quest if it wasn't her class quest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">...Hrmm.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A ten-story pavilion—the look in Jishuka’s eyes changed as she entered the largest and most gorgeous inn in the capital of Cho, Kars—the Wind Lantern Inn. She already felt something strange just from walking the streets. The people of Kars looked gloomy, as if they had experienced a type of disaster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Why is the atmosphere of the capital so gloomy?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">All the other areas of the Cho Kingdom had a bright atmosphere. Why did the people of the capital look like this? The vigilant Jishuka called out to the waiter, “The menu please.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">Ah.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Cho Kingdom was a place where both east and west culture co-existed. How could she speak English after visiting such an obviously Oriental inn? Jishuka felt regret for a moment but fortunately, there were no communication problems.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yep. Here’s the menu.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is basic English necessary to be a waiter....?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">Huh?</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Nothing, I was just talking to myself.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The waiter was around 15 years old. Jishuka smiled at the boy and gave him a silver coin as a tip. The boy, who had already been enjoying Jishuka’s beauty, was delighted after receiving the coin and treated her as a young master. He soon served the food and Jishuka asked him, “What happened? Everyone’s facial expressions are so uncomfortable."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">Ah</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, that...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The power of beauty and tips was awesome.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The boy sincerely answered Jishuka’s question, “Zombies and skeletons have been appearing every night this week and wandering through the city. All the people of the capital are uneasy and unable to sleep. They couldn’t sleep at all because they have been fighting with a broom all night to drive the zombies away from their front yards.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Undead appeared in the middle of a capital with such strict defenses?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It isn’t just in the middle. They crawled out of every corner. The kingdom says that a wicked daoist is staying in the capital and playing tricks... Therefore, you should be careful. People’s gazes toward foreigners aren’t very good these days.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I can’t understand it.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The guardian god of the Cho Kingdom was the red phoenix. Grid’s revival of the red phoenix blessed the entire nation and the sacred flames of the red phoenix had the power to destroy all evil. Yet undead appeared every night?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It is clear that someone is deliberately releasing the undead...’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Who was so strong that they could summon undead that could withstand the flames of the red phoenix? This was really a level of skill that went beyond common sense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘...Wait?’ A chill went down Jishuka’s spine. She focused on the mention of ‘zombies,’ not ‘jiangshi.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Did you say they are skeletons and zombies?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There are zombies in the East Continent?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It isn’t impossible, but... it is hard to see them. The daoists of the East Continent make jiangshi, not zombies.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the end, this was the work of a necromancer from the West Continent. Jishuka remembered the face of a madman and asked the waiter again, “The soldiers must be exhausted as well?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes... They haven’t been able to sleep for a week because they have been fighting the undead... All the soldiers are having a hard time.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I think this is more serious than expected?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jishuka got up from her seat and walked out of the inn. She observed and grasped the location of the inn and the surrounding topography. The last place she stared at was the top floor of the inn.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is there an empty room?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, that place is always empty. As you can see, it is a room that uses the entire top floor so the accommodation fee is very expensive. Even the nobles and wealthy people from other lands were reluctant to stay there.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll rent it for a few days.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">Huh?</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;No, Customer. One night in that room is worth dozens of nights in other rooms...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He didn’t want to fill the stomach of the boss who said he wanted to catch a pushover. Jishuka threw a small bag at the waiter who was trying to persuade her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This should be enough.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">...Gasp!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The waiter’s eyes widened when he opened the bag. It was the first time the boy had seen so many gold coins even though he was working at Kars’ largest inn. Jishuka sighed. ‘I managed to save a little bit only to use it all up again.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She still had quite a bit left to pay back Grid so she was troubled. However, Jishuka had no intention of missing this opportunity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The inn owner welcomed her, “Oh my, welcome, welcome! The Wind Lantern Inn is dedicated to serving the princess!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The meals will be room service.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;“I will do so!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;‘He looks like a money-obsessed ghost.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jishuka stared coldly as the inn owner hurriedly ran out of the room. Then she went out to the terrace and activated Hawk Eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Good.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was as expected. All of Kars filled her field of view. All the routes to the major facilities, including the palace, could be seen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Now you are all dead.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Jishuka smiled deeper and her eyes flashed like a hawk who captured the prey.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Stones were weak to heat. Unlike iron, they didn’t melt in fire. They broke apart or were burned. It wasn’t about smelting and tempering when it comes to making things out of stone. It was about meticulous work.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘This is a myth-rated mineral.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;It would be a weapon of the greatest power just by making it into a blade. This was what Grid thought...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">“Groan...”</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He soon realized that he had misjudged. The Fire Stone Filled with the Breath of the Fire Dragon couldn’t be broken no matter how hard he struck it. There were no scratches at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘What am I supposed to do?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grid’s struggles continued. He kept hammering on the fire stone until his stamina ran out. He even improved by changing to a high-grade saw. However, the fire stone didn’t budge.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">“Gasp.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">Gasp...”</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grid’s hand, holding the hammer, convulsed. What should he do? Grid was forced to admit that his methods were wrong. He forgot about the passage of time and concentrated on thinking. Finally, a rooster’s cry echoed through the tranquil streets as a new morning was announced.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The dozing blacksmiths, who didn’t dare leave work when the king remained, opened their eyes all at once. At the same time, lightning struck inside Grid’s head. A stone filled with the breath of the fire dragon. It had probably been exposed to the hottest heat in the world. It was also for 200 years. Was it right to look at it like a stone?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He burned the white phosphorus wood. Grid raised the temperature of the furnace to its maximum and threw in the fire stone without hesitation.</span></p>
