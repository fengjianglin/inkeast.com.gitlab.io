 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Paris, Charles de Gaulle International Airport.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was one of the busiest airports in Europe, with around 530,000 planes landing and taking off every year. It was always bustling with people.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was good to see it crowded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was large and scary.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Korea’s national team descended from Yura’s private plane and entered the 2E terminal.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their mouths dropped open as they saw the interior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doesn’t it seem bigger than Incheon Airport?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right. It’s two times bigger than Incheon National Airport.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, look at the map. It takes an hour to walk to the nearest exit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura explained to the astonished group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry. We can catch a bus.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura was the best beauty and ranked 5th in the unified rankings, so she had always been an object of interest and was invited to many countries.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was already her 9th visit to Paris.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was familiar with the landscape, and after following her, the group of people walked 20 minutes to a bus stop and boarded a bus.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to his habit from his school days, Youngwoo sat directly behind the driver’s seat and sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are we moving to the city with this bus?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was worried about moving through a large airport, so he was glad that they could move relatively comfortably.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura spoke shocking words to the relieved Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the airport shuttle bus.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Airport shuttle...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, we will take this to the nearest taxi stop and take a taxi to the city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The airport was enough to make a person tired.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo looked out the window and pledged not to visit Paris again.&nbsp;</span><span style>Paris was one of the world’s top tourist destinations, but Satisfy had a lot more beautiful spots. Therefore, he didn’t feel any inspiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Yura was sitting next to Youngwoo and smiling softly.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo’s forearms were now solid and burly, different from when they first met. It was a pleasant and reassuring sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why is she sitting next to me when there are plenty of empty seats?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It felt good to touch Yura’s soft skin.&nbsp;</span><span style>From the side, her nose was as beautiful as a sophisticated artwork. There were no spots on her white skin, making her look like a pure snow field.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Thump thump thump thump.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo’s heart started beating faster as he became conscious of Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Remain calm, calm.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The nervous Youngwoo formed tight fists.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was worried about what might happen if he moved a finger by mistake and touched Yura’s body.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The Korean team travelled 40 minutes by taxi from Charles de Gaulle airport and arrived at their hotel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shang X Lila Hotel.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a 5 star hotel located 600 meters from the Eiffel Tower.&nbsp;</span><span style>The luxurious interior was reminiscent of a palace from medieval times, and the guest rooms had a view of the Eiffel Tower and Montmarte.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Furthermore, the restaurants in this place made it into the Michelin Guide?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The rate for the rooms is probably ridiculously expensive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard that the cheapest room rate is 2 million won per night, while the expensive rooms are priced at 30~40 million won.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“30~40 million? F-For one day...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A total of 224 people were participating in the 2nd Satisfy National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>The S.A. Group provided accommodations at 5 star hotels for all of them. It was for 16 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Indeed, this was the power of the world’s number one group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It would’ve been great if Sehee could participate in this tournament.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo admired the luxurious room assigned to him and was reminded of his sister Sehee.&nbsp;</span><span style>He imagined how delighted Sehee would be to see this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Well, there’s no urgency. I will be with her starting from next year’s National Competition.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Sehee was a student.&nbsp;</span><span style>She had little time to play Satisfy because of her studies, and her level was low, so she couldn’t participate in the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it would be different starting next year.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee had a good understanding of the value of Satisfy and her Saintess class. Therefore, she was planning to concentrate on Satisfy after she entered university.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“By the way, what are these clothes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo frowned as he unpacked his clothes.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t the training clothes and slippers that he normally wore. Instead, there were sneakers, slacks, cotton shirts, and jeans. There were even nice shoes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You want me to wear something like this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo dressed just for convenience. Style</span><span style>? He had no interest in that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was traumatized by being ignored by his first love Ahyoung after wearing fashionable clothes to pursue her, and he didn’t pay attention to fashion after that. In particular, he hated the cramped nature of the collared shirts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee knew these tendencies and still packed these clothes?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sehee, this girl...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She pretended that she wanted to pack because he would be gone for a while, but it was just a trick?&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo complained as he showered and changed clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He selected one of the coordinated sets that Sehee had arranged from 1 to 19. He chose the 1st set because it had number 1 on it. Today was his first day in Paris. He would wear set 2 on the next day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Roll your shirt up to your elbow and tuck it in your pants! Wear this watch!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Wow, the man who will be her husband later on will really be tired.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo checked the note that Sehee left and dressed according to the contents of the note. He stood in front of the mirror and his eyes widened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Don’t I look very handsome?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, Youngwoo had heard many times that he was ugly.&nbsp;</span><span style>The protruding cheekbones, high T zone, and eyes without double eyelids gave him an overall nervous impression.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>His skin was rough and his shoulders were hunched over, so he gave off a bad impression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But in the past year and a half, Youngwoo had gained weight and trained his body through exercise. His features also matured as he got older and his skin care was good compared to the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, even if he didn’t compare to the past, he looked good when compared to the average Korean male.&nbsp;</span><span style>His high T zone and filled up cheeks emanated a Western charm, while his wide shoulders accentuated his masculinity. In particular, his eyes were sexy to women.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to Sehee’s styling, Youngwoo was able to show off his charms.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Knock knock.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo was staring blankly in front of a mirror and became astonished at the sound of knocking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Are you ready?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword came into the room and felt amazed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ohu, you’re dressed properly for once.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword raised his thumb.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo felt better and left the room.&nbsp;</span><span style>The two people headed to the ground floor of the hotel, where the press conference would be held.&nbsp;</span><span style>The US, British, and Turkish teams, who were also staying at the same hotel, were seated already.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas waved from where he was sitting as the representative of the British team.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, the US team leader Zibal was indifferent to Youngwoo, and Bubat, the Turkish representative, was staring at Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? I’m South Korea’s representative?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was confused when he saw ‘Shin Youngwoo’ as the Korean team leader and Yura belatedly explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We decided that at the meeting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why? Heok.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo swallowed his breath at Yura’s appearance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura appeared wearing a dress, looking like the goddess of beauty had descended.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo couldn’t take his eyes off the neckline that was revealed by her tied up hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are the strongest among us, and aren’t you also the master of Overgeared? Who else would be the representative?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Do I have leadership?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the master of Overgeared, all he did was make items and hunt.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo wasn’t convinced, but Yura’s evaluation was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>During the Elfin Stone raid, Youngwoo showed unexpected leadership that minimized the damage to his colleagues.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura was very appreciative of Youngwoo’s potential as the leader, so she aimed to train this potential in the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes... Eh... Um...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo was swayed by the unexpected praise and Peak Sword pushed him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Everybody is waiting for you, God Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Youngwoo sat in the seat of the Korean team’s representative.&nbsp;</span><span style>At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘His expression changed?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hundreds of reporters and staff gathered at the meeting place were surprised at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo’s silly expression changed as soon as he sat down. His eyes gazed sharply as hundreds of eyes focused on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry I’m late. I am Shin Youngwoo, also known as Grid, the Korean team’s representative.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An ordinary person would be nervous in front of the public. It was hard to maintain their spirit while being burdened by the many gazes focused on them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Especially the Youngwoo of the past.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He lacked confidence, so he had trouble communicating with someone in front of his eyes. He always looked at the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he had developed since starting Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>He realized his value and found his confidence. He became familiar with the public gaze as duke, hero of the kingdom, and head of Overgeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was the leader of more than 20,000 people and hundreds of guild members. &nbsp;How could he shrink back in front of hundreds of journalists?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was impossible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is this a live broadcast? I would like to say hello to all the people who are watching me right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Relaxed eyes and stable intonation.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was incomparable to the Youngwoo from the 1st National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“God Grid, this is why I decided to follow you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword knew how rare it was for a person to grow and change quickly.&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword once again felt inspired to follow Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Today, from Youngwoo’s style to his attitude, everything was Yura’s favorite.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, the Korean people watching the press conference live on TV and on the Internet were impressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Was Grid’s personality always so intense?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Last year, he seemed like a child, but now he clearly isn’t.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doesn’t he look handsomer than before? Plastic surgery?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is that plastic surgery? He used to look like that from the beginning, but it was just his style. You should go in front of a mirror and look at yourself. You look stupid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think he did a lot of exercise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A diamond in the rough...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy had a culture beyond a simple game.&nbsp;</span><span style>And the representative of Satisfy in South Korea was Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttiring~</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttiring~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The rankings of the search portals were renewed about Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo’s parents watching the TV in their vegetable store was also impressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Our son has become more dependable... Our son is the representative of South Korea for two consecutive years...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We gave birth to such a good son. Right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The National Competition hadn’t even started yet.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Youngwoo had already become prominent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Not as Grid, but as ‘Shin Youngwoo.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>One foreign reporter didn’t like it and threw a provocative question at him from the beginning.&nbsp;</span></p>
