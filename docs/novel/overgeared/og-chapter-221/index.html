 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit was from a rural part of the country, but his genius and talent caused him to rise to the top of the Mero Company.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past, he was the first to recognize that the level 21 Grid had a huge talent and suggested a partnership.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This commoner, Rabbit, greets the great hero, Duke Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit hadn’t changed since the first day they met.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wore thin-rimmed glasses and gave off the impression of a cultured gentleman. There were no signs of greed in his eyes, but he looked more like a saint than a merchant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But what was the truth?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Unlike his appearance, Rabbit was as greedy as Grid. That’s how he was able to succeed as a merchant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A true charlatan gives a sense of confidence to the other person.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid grinned with satisfaction and greeted Rabbit.&nbsp;</span><span style>“You must’ve had a hard time. Isn’t it nice to see people after being stuck in prison for a long time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thanks to the people of Winston treating me as a hero, Marquis Steim gave me many conveniences.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s good. I’m relieved to see that you’re healthy. It’s nice to meet you again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit’s insight detected the changes in Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>His gestures, expressions, speech, etc.&nbsp;</span><span style>From head to toe, everything about the current Grid was completely different from the Grid of the past.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn't a simple change, so Rabbit felt a thrill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I underestimated you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The future that Rabbit saw for Grid was the best blacksmith and the richest person.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the current Grid was...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You are pursuing the path of rising to the top, where everyone will look up at you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was heartfelt appreciation.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Grid from a while ago would’ve overreacted.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now Grid combined reality and humility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s a challenge. I’m lacking a lot, so I need your help. Will you serve me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit bowed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he answered formally, showing his loyalty with honest words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duke Grid, I don’t doubt that you are the one who will make me the richest man on the continent. So I’m willing to follow you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid also responded honestly.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Not the richest person on the continent. I will be the richest person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haha, then I will just dream of being rich.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So be it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smiled as he pulled out the Great Lord's Sword and laid it on Rabbit’s shoulder.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t a problem that this was a smithy instead of a palace.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rather, it was more meaningful because a smithy was the place where Grid’s identity was established.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From this moment on, you will be a viscount of the Eternal Kingdom. But you need only be loyal to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Marquis Steim was still an earl, he had appointed Grid as a viscount, despite Grid being a commoner.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a duke, Grid also had the authority to arbitrarily give someone a title.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he had no plans to abuse Rabbit, as he planned to give Rabbit a monthly salary that suited his title.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could sell titles to users, but Lauel had dissuaded him from doing this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Both I and my descendants will be faithful only to My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A notification window popped up the moment Rabbit made the oath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have used your authority as a duke to appoint ‘Rabbit’ as a viscount.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have an obligation to give Rabbit a monthly salary of 500 gold every month. Rabbit’s loyalty will fall if you don’t pay this salary.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Delight appeared on Grid’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'As I expected, he’s a named NPC.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Rabbit</span></p>
 <p><span style>Age: 37 &nbsp;Gender: Male</span></p>
 <p><span style>Occupation: Merchant/ Viscount of the Eternal Kingdom</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: Wealthy Merchant</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The best merchant of this era. He has the ability to create demand even for simple stones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level: 307</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strength: 49 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 380</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agility: 150 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligence: 2,241</span></p>
 <p><span style>Political Power: 1,505 &nbsp;&nbsp;Insight: 1,533</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leadership: 512 &nbsp;&nbsp;Charm: 210</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skills: Composure (A+), Detection (A+), Administration (S), Business Acumen (S+), Wisdom of a Great Merchant (SS).</span></p>
 <p><span style>Born in Winston, in the northern part of the kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was born a commoner, but he devoted himself to his studies.&nbsp;</span><span style>After proving that he had talent, he received a sponsorship to the Central Academy and graduated as the best student.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He served as a royal administrator, but received unfair treatment due to his commoner status. Therefore, he became a merchant and made the best achievements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to his poor childhood, he has a tendency to cling to money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Composure (A+)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what situation he faces, he won’t lose his composure. It’s rare for him to make mistakes because his brain is active at all times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Detection (A+)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Can see the essence of humans and objects. He can easily communicate with anyone and always gets the best results.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Administration (S)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he belongs to a certain power, the ability to manage the affairs is excellent. It is at a level that can develop a small village into a city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Business Acumen (S+)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The trading ability has reached the highest level. Even a piece of garbage can be made into a product.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Wisdom of a Great Merchant (SS)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The experience and know how of someone who made a large company.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'S-grade Administration...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The speed of development of a city was proportional to the grade of the administrator.&nbsp;</span><span style>The role of an administrator was very important, but it wasn’t an easy task to find one with a high rating.&nbsp;</span><span style>Winston was the second largest city in the north, and even Administrator Valdi only had a B-grade.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then how fast would a place grow with a S-grade administrator?&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t dare imagine it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘His ability as a merchant is S+ and SS...'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit even had the ability to make goods out of rubbish.&nbsp;</span><span style>Based on the description, it was a complete scam.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How should I handle him?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Should Rabbit serve as an administrator, or work as a merchant?&nbsp;</span><span style>Rabbit spoke while he couldn’t make a decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Before I came to see you, I looked over Reidan. It’s good that you are clearing the fields and connecting waterways, but I feel like it’s too much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Too much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Doesn’t Reidan only have a population of 20,000? If the number of fields are reduced by a third, it will be enough to feed the people."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid explained the situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Once the clearing of the fields is done, we plan to expand farming and build this up as an agricultural city. This will be the basis to become a commercial city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s the wrong choice. Due to the hot climate of Reidan, only a limited number of crops can be grown. Reidan isn’t suitable as an agricultural city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There are no problems with the species restrictions. In the first place, we were planning to concentrate and export the crops that can be harvested quickly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel entered the smithy at this time and rebutted.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had an upset expression on his face and Rabbit responded appropriately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Crops that can be harvested quickly aren’t competitive. They are easy to get anywhere.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel glared at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We can overcome it by selling a lot at a cheap price. Currently, the only advantage of Reidan is the spacious land. Using the land is the only way to build up funds, so the reality is that Reidan can only be an agricultural city. No, first, who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid introduced him.&nbsp;</span><span style>“This is Rabbit. He was once the number two of the Mero Company, the largest in the north.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was angry.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was only the number two of a northern company, yet he dared try to decide the city’s policies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid handed him the Great Lord's Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid explained to the bewildered Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Wear it and examine Rabbit yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What are you trying...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was annoyed that Grid would listen to the opinion of a merchant over him.&nbsp;</span><span style>He grumbled as he wore the Great Lord's Sword and observed Rabbit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>These days, Lauel was often surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid persuaded Lauel as he checked Rabbit’s stats and skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I’m not discrediting your abilities, but why don’t you try and listen to Rabbit’s thoughts? Who knows? It might help you as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"I will entrust the overall management of the territory to Rabbit. I will work in the fields.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel decided.&nbsp;</span><span style>He recognized that Rabbit’s administrative ability was superior to his.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid questioned him.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Can’t you also show great abilities as an administrator? Isn’t it better to have Rabbit create a business company, since it will make more use of his talents?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Even though I have business ability, I don’t have the ‘Administration’ skill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Satisfy was a game.&nbsp;</span><span style>The importance of skills was higher than practical abilities.&nbsp;</span><span style>Administrators greatly increased the pace of domestic development because they had the Administration skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In addition, diplomacy is included in the work of an administrator. Rabbit’s talent as a merchant will manifest itself in the form of diplomacy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel’s guess was correct.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After being appointed as the administrator, Rabbit reduced the scale of agriculture and invested in alchemy as well as facilities to amplify the value of blacksmiths, including Grid and Khan. At the same time, he exerted his talent as a merchant by talking diplomatically with ‘Baron Butin of the Saharan Empire.’</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“The alchemists say that the sand of the desert has no value in alchemy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Reidan’s only available resource was sand.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sand was the basic material required for construction, but that was the role of sea sand. Unlike the sand at the sea, the desert sand was so fine that there was no place to use it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Modern society could utilize the desert sand due to advanced technology, but Satisfy’s background was a medieval fantasy, so its technology was inferior to modern times.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rabbit tried to use the sand in magic and alchemy, but he couldn’t achieve satisfactory results.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then one day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let’s export the sand to Baron Butin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit came to Lauel and spoke nonsense.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel was perplexed.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Why should we export desert sand to Baron Butin?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The desert was all over the west. There was an excess of sand so there was no point in exporting it.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was realistically impossible.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rabbit smiled at Lauel’s disapproval and explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will make it so that the baron has to import it.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Rabbit noted that Baron Butin owned one of the empire’s resorts where many wealthy people and nobles visited.&nbsp;</span><span style>“The people of Reidan have lived in this hot and desolate place for 10 years. I will advertise it like this. The sand of Reidan remedy of longevity that will improve human health.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was stunned by the absurd words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit continued.&nbsp;</span><span style>"It’s a luxury product made with magic, and those who don’t have it will covet it. I will set the price higher so that the image of a luxury product will be firmly established. The longevity remedy won’t be credible if it’s cheap.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, what type of sophistry…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel wondered if Rabbit was sane.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Rabbit didn’t care and kept talking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will use Khan as my advertising model. He’s older than 60, so if we put him front and center, the trust of the customers will increase and the reputation of the longevity remedy will rise.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit referred to the sands of Reidan as a ‘longevity remedy.’&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel was convinced that Rabbit was crazy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rabbit had high stats and great skills as a named NPC, but he had a clear flaw in his personality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But what was the truth?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s selling well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sands of Reidan were called the ‘Longevity Remedy’ and started to be imported at the mad price of 3 gold per 10 grams.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the nobles and wealthy people who visited the Butin Barony heard about the reason why the sand of Reidan was called the Longevity Remedy, they couldn’t resist buying out of curiosity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This might cause a serious problem in the future...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was concerned, but Rabbit reassured him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"3 gold is huge for a commoner, but this is trivial for the rich.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if they knew it was a scam, they could just laugh it off.&nbsp;</span><span style>They didn’t have to get angry over that level of money.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the first place, there was no reason to call it a scam.&nbsp;</span><span style>How could people know their exact lifespan?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>There was no way to prove that the lifespan of a person was increased or not increased by the Longevity Remedy, so there was no reason to call it a scam.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The one thing I regret is that there aren’t more people visiting the Butin Barony. For the moment, the profit from selling this will stay at around 800 gold per month. But if the rumors of the goods become widespread in the future, things will change again."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...This is a good idea.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>800 gold a month.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a ridiculously small sum for a big city.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the product being sold was mere sand.&nbsp;</span><span style>They just needed to put the sand that could be found anywhere in pretty glass bottles and sell them for 3 gold each.&nbsp;</span><span style>The net profit was 99.9%.&nbsp;</span><span style>If the sales amount rose like Rabbit predicted, it would be a powerful revenue source for Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He truly is a wealthy merchant...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is a complete scam.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel and the Overgeared members were alerted to the true nature behind Rabbit’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid just laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All types of talented people were gathering around him.</span></p>
