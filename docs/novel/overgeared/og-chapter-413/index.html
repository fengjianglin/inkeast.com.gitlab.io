 <p><span style>Chapter 413</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>『 ... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The broadcasting companies showing the National Competition fell silent at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were shocked by Grid’s abilities that surpassed the imagination and were at a loss for words.&nbsp;</span><span style>But as professionals, they couldn’t remain silent forever.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The broadcasters hurriedly regained their minds and proceeded again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Basically, Satisfy implements a system where the player’s defense mitigates the damage as a percentage. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 In the National Competition, PvP damage is reduced by 50%. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Experts observed that PvP damage is actually 30~35% in the National Competition due to the player’s defense... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 ...Grid quickly took care of Bondre and eight representatives. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Grid’s damage is far too powerful. It seems like there’s a limit that the player’s defense can alleviate his attack. Even the patch can’t stop his might. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 It isn’t just high attack power. Grid perfectly utilized a counterattack against the high ranker Bondre. Is this just a coincidence? No. Grid is different from last year. Now Grid seems to have high quality control. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 ... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hosts praised him while the experts who predicted that ‘it is fortunate if South Korea doesn’t come last’ were silent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s show was amazing. It was beyond expectations.&nbsp;</span><span style>God Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the moment when the arrogant nickname was once again engraved onto the minds of the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Bubat of the Turkish team had a relaxed expression on his face.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s level was just what he expected.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Indeed, the patch had an impact.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Grid used the new skill called Linked Kill Wave, Bubat predicted that all the people hit by it would die.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the result was only four deaths, three serious injuries and one minor injury.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This alone was a very traumatic incident.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were few people who could sweep away the skilled people of each country with one blow.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, wasn’t their opponent Grid?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was a monster who destroyed dozens of people in the National Competition last year with just Transcended Link. Compared to last year, his power had definitely fallen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'He isn’t a threat to me now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bubat was convinced as he looked at Grid, who even Bubat couldn’t defeat.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a reason for Bubat’s confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Undefeated King’s Battle Gear Set]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madra, a man who had never been defeated and was called the Undefeated King.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the 9th king of the Lubana Kingdom, which was now absorbed by the Saharan Empire.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a legend that the Lubana Kingdom was unbeatable during his rule.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Saharan Empire in its prime couldn’t occupy the Lubana Kingdom that Madra defended. The Lubana Kingdom was safe until Madra’s death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'The undefeated king who endured the onslaught of the enemy knights alone.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now Bubat had the strongest set of armor used by a legendary person.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bubat gained wings from the set and had the best tanking power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You can’t imagine the sacrifices I made to get this, Grid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite the failures he experienced, Bubat’s eyes remained brilliant and strong.&nbsp;</span><span style>After arming himself with a blue armour and holding a large shield in his hands, Bubat ran towards Grid and shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will stop you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bubat took out his unique rated weapon, ‘Seres’ Hammer.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Now Grid will be frustrated.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He defeated four players with Linked Kill Wave and all the French players retreated after Bondre’s defeat, but the number of people here was still overwhelming.&nbsp;</span><span style>The South Korean team were surrounded and under pressure from over 60 enemies.&nbsp;</span><span style>South Korea would be in a crisis if Grid didn’t get there quickly, so Grid would be in a hurry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then as if to prove his impatience...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blackening.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Demonic energy exploded from Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid increased his attack power but received a penalty of lowering his health.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘As expected!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bubat smiled with satisfaction as he watched the nervous Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Bring it on!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[Taunting Shout has been activated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The enemy will be provoked.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rare hidden class, Crusher.&nbsp;</span><span style>His stats was that of a typical tanker, but the greatest advantage of the class was its ability to destroy formations.&nbsp;</span><span style>He used the ‘Unconditional’ skill to rush within 3m of the target and used CC combos to instantly destroy the enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But last year, this didn’t exert any power on Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was immune to abnormal status conditions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Now it is different!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the course of achieving level 310, Bubat acquired skills that forced the enemy into an abnormal status.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was originally designed to allow CC to work on boss raids, but it was currently deadly to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[’Bubat’ has taunted you.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You can’t resist.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Lauel’s concern was right.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was sure that for the sake of balance, skills that overcome the status conditions immunity would surely emerge.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had scoffed at the time, but Lauel’s concern was turned to reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was like when a game company sold the cash shop item ‘Shield that absolutely defends against an enemy’s attack’ and later sold an ‘item that breaks down the absolute shield’ at a higher price.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the zoomed in face of Grid distorted, the hundreds of millions of viewers realized the situation that was happening.&nbsp;</span><span style>The silent experts suddenly shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 That armor that Bubat is wearing...! I’ve seen it in an ancient book! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 It’s Undefeated King Madra’s battle gear set! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Undefeated King Madra was called a legendary tanker. There is a record stating that he endured the onslaught of the Red Knights alone! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Bubat’s tanking power will be beyond imagination. Grid won’t be able to defeat Bubat. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 In the end, Grid failed to save the Korean team. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The experts raised the anxiety of the Korean viewers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Wow, really.</span></i> <i><span style>I looked up Undefeated King Madra and he is wearing the exact same armor as Bubat.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>One of the best tankers is equipped with the best armor...</span></i> <i><span style>However, God Grid will win.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>A lot of Grid’s skills must be on cooldown...</span></i> <i><span style>It might be tough.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>If this was the reaction of Koreans, what about the foreigners?&nbsp;</span><span style>Most people believed that Bubat was a mountain that Grid couldn’t cross.&nbsp;</span><span style>However.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid arrived in front of Bubat, regardless of his will, due to the taunt.&nbsp;</span><span style>He used Blacksmith’s Rage and Quick Movements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha! Try and hit me! You will realize that it is futile and feel despair!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bubat provoked Grid to the end.&nbsp;</span><span style>Iyarugt aimed for the weak spot detected by the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Pinnacle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Pinnacle Lv. 4 (0.5%)</span></p>
 <p><span style>A sword that expresses the essence of a warrior god.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deals 800% of your attack power to a single target. This skill will ignore 64% of the target’s armor.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s attack speed suddenly became very fast?&nbsp;</span><span style>The attack orbit was hard to read.&nbsp;</span><span style>More than anything else...</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 17,050 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It hurts?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, what was this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shield held in Bubat’s hand became obsolete.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“U-Uhh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bubat blinked because he couldn’t understand what was happening.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was natural.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Crusher possessed the highest level of defense among the numerous classes in Satisfy, and Bubat was also wearing the strongest armor set belonging to the undefeated king.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then why was it so painful?&nbsp;</span><span style>Bubat staggered and seemed to fall into a state of confusion.&nbsp;</span><span style>He tried to counterattack with his hammer, but Grid boasted extreme agility due to Quick Movements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Slaughterer’s Eye Patch and Iyarugt told him the attack orbit and he could defend against it.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid ignored the hammer.&nbsp;</span><span style>He judged that Bubat’s attack power wasn’t threatening at all.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 1,090 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bubat’s eyes widened with astonishment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a unique rated hammer, so why didn’t it do any damage?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What? Isn’t this a big deal?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did Grid’s defence go beyond their predictions?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A tanker? Don't tell me?'</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If I can’t reproduce the strongest attack power because of the patch, then I will show the strongest defense. I will thoroughly use this patch to look much better than last year.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s remark from the press conference entered his mind.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bubat never even imagined it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid hadn’t even pulled out Three Layers yet.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid aimed a finger at the confused Bubat’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Magic Missile."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Magic Missile (Enhanced) constantly gained proficiency in the Behen Archipelago, but it was still level 2. The experience was only at 60%. The proficiency gain rate of legendary skills was the worst.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the damage of the legendary magic was strong.&nbsp;</span><span style>It ignored the enemy’s magic resistance and dealt damage equal to twice Grid’s current magic power.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was still wearing the Holy Light set, meaning his intelligence was increased by 200 due to the Holy Light Crown.&nbsp;</span><span style>The elixirs also increased his intelligence by 400.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bubat was surprised by the high damage.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Ugh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bubat’s head snapped back after he was hit by Magic Missile.&nbsp;</span><span style>Looking at the blue sky, Bubat was convinced that the situation was the worst.&nbsp;</span><span style>Notification windows appeared in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The option effect of Iyarugt has caused the target to bleed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The 3rd combo has been achieved!]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The option effect of Iyarugt maximizes the bleeding of the target. The damage done to the target will increase by 200% for 1 second.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid attacked during this gap.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Pinnacle Kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Pinnacle Kill]</span></p>
 <p><span style>An attack that completely ignores the target’s defense and deals 2,000% of your attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The sword can change orbit in the middle, making it hard to deal with.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaack!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like most tankers, Bubat invested his stat points into stamina, and his agility was very low.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, he hardly ever encountered inconveniences due to low agility.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was it sometimes difficult to respond to enemy attacks because of low agility?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It didn’t matter. His defense was high, so he could endure it.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid’s attacks were an exception.&nbsp;</span><span style>They hurt.&nbsp;</span><span style>He struck continuously and eventually linked Hell Sword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a legendary attack skill attached to Iyarugt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It was another star.&nbsp;</span><span style>It happened in less than a minute.</span></p>
