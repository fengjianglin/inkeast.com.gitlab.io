 <p><span style>Chapter 142</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>A few months ago, Grid had owed money to creditors. He suffered all types of persecution under the Mother's Heart is Happy employees.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did hard labor every day in order to pay back the interest and practically lived as a slave with no signs of a better life. He couldn’t even dream of being loved by others, or enjoying himself over a bottle of soju.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now it was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had got a legendary class and barely succeeded for a while. However, now the debt had been completely cleared and he became rich.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the Malacus raid, he produced the Thorn of Deep Grievance for Ibellin and earned 4.61 billion won in revenue. He still had 2.95 billion won left, despite paying 5% of the gold sales commission fee to the item trading site, paying off his family’s remaining debt, and purchasing a car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nowadays, Grid could eat chicken once every two weeks.&nbsp;</span><span style>He could eat one chicken in one meal without having to share.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now that he could enjoy such luxuries, he wanted to collect 10 billion won to buy a piece of land and build a residence!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But before starting that, he thought he needed to produce Failure first.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he moved to purchase blue orichalcum, which was the main ingredient of Failure. However,</span><span style>&nbsp;there were no blue orichalcum at the auction site in the game or on the Internet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It might be because no users had raided the Guardian of the Forest, or the drop rate of blue orichalcum was low, or another blacksmith had bought the blue orichalcum.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t know the exact reason why there were no blue orichalcum for sale. But he knew the answer to obtain blue orichalcum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t it a simple task to collect them directly from the Guardian of the Forest raid?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I obtained three blue orichalcum when selling the Sword of Self-transcendence to Administrator Vladi... I need 12 more blue orichalcum to produce Failure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was currently in front of the Guardian of the Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The deepest part of the forest.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a huge crater where the forest used to be.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid started to observe all the topographic features, including the trees tinged with grey ash. </span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The soldiers don’t have enough cover to depend on. The trees will be crushed like cookies... It will be a frontal confrontation.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wasn’t particularly worried.&nbsp;</span><span style>As long as the knights and soldiers marked the golems summoned by the Guardian of the Forest, he could defeat the Guardian of the Forest in that gap.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the knights and soldiers were afraid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“E-Excuse me Viscount... Shouldn’t we go back now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please save us! If I die, my wife and children will be sad!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m still young...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite Grid showing his strength on the way here, the morale of the knights and soldiers was still low.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, Grid threw off the broad-brimmed hat he had been wearing. Then he wore the Holy Light Crown and pulled out the Commander's Sword to raise his dignity stat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Guardian of the Forest? Didn’t I get rid of Malacus, who filled the world with terror? You just have to believe in me. Yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“O-Ohhh...!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s current dignity stat was 364 points. If he added 200 points from the Holy Light Crown and 30 points from the Commander’s Sword, his dignity stat neared a huge 600 points.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was comparable to the dignity stat points held by the top NPCs that represented each nation, even if they weren’t kings.&nbsp;</span><span style>The general soldiers as well as the knights, Romeo and Deck, couldn’t help bowing to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I have great faith in the viscount. We will follow you with no more complaints.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Okay."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The troops fell silent. Grid felt satisfied and started to look around again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘By the way, why isn’t the Guardian of the Forest appearing? Shouldn’t it appear now?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had confirmed the raid timetable through a website in advance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Today was the day that the Guardian of the Forest was supposed to respawn, and the timing was right as well.&nbsp;</span><span style>He also had to be careful of other raid parties, so he had deliberately hid his face and identity with a hat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But when he arrived here, there were no raid parties and the Guardian of the Forest couldn’t be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Don’t tell me the site is a scam?’&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a paid membership site. Grid was angry since he had paid 130,000 won in order to check the raid timetable.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘I trusted it because it has a lot of members...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was convinced that he had been cheated of the price of six chickens and kicked a rock furiously.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the small rock started to shake loudly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jude clapped with wide eyes,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Amazing. The rock you kicked is dancing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s not it...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The knights and soldiers became frantic.&nbsp;</span><span style>The rock that Grid kicked was moving and growing larger?&nbsp;</span><span style>Like a turtle hiding inside its shell, it was the moment when the crouched up Guardian of the Forest fully emerged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was a little strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this guy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was confused.&nbsp;</span><span style>Originally, the Guardian of the Forest should be over 5m and large. However, this one had a height similar to Grid and was sleek looking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Isn’t it like a human?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were five fingers and toes on each extended limb, just like a person.&nbsp;</span><span style>Except for the back that was made of hard rocks, the whole body was composed of transparent ores and flashing above its head was the name ‘Awakened Guardian of the Forest.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You, what are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He tried to measure the combat power but it was ???. There were only question marks.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid instinctively perceived the danger and became alert.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the Awakened Guardian of the Forest narrowed the distance in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There was a storm in the aftermath of his movements. The ash scattered all over the place and the roots of the trees were shaken.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was like watching Regas.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Awakened Guardian of the Forest aimed a sharp kick.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Deck, standing next to Grid, coughed up blood and turned into light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The knight Deck has died.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crazy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Killing a level 185 knight in one blow?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid hurriedly exclaimed,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Avoid it! Especially Jude! You absolutely must survive!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The knights and soldiers wouldn’t be any help.&nbsp;</span><span style>The tense Grid put a hand into his inventory.&nbsp;</span><span style>The black greatsword was pulled out and Dainsleif showed its majestic appearance.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>It had now been 47 days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had promised to make a new armor for Vantner.&nbsp;</span><span style>Following Pon and Ibellin, he was fortunate enough to be the third winner of Grid’s production item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Now I can be born again as an overgeared person!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When armed with the strongest armor that Grid would produce, his defense would be sufficient and he could run amok!&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner was excited. It wasn’t an exaggeration to call him the most delighted person in the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But what was this? An absurd thing happened.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid abandoned the armor production for a quest? Then there was no news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From that day, the time of waiting begun.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner waited every day for Grid to return. A fortnight passed and he waited indefinitely.&nbsp;</span><span style>Whenever he walked the street, he would frantically look if he heard any grumbling. If he saw an Asian man, he would think it was Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t return until a month and two weeks later.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner wasn’t able to contact Grid because the guild chat and whispers were blocked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It was enough to make Vantner curse.&nbsp;</span><span style>He honestly didn’t know how many times he insulted Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But as he waited for Grid, Vantner fell in love.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then four days ago!&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid returned to Winston as Vantner dreamed of.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner’s long wait would be repaid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can finally get my armor...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner was thrilled to tears. He ran off to meet Grid, like he was reuniting with a lover.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he became frustrated.&nbsp;</span><span style>Instead of producing an armor, Grid suddenly announced his marriage. It was also to Lady Irene who Vantner had been longing for!</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the day of the wedding ceremony, Vantner was in turmoil from the unexpected developments and couldn’t hide his hostility towards Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rather than bringing up the wait, he was angry at Grid taking away Lady Irene. Then he became drunk during the wedding, cursed Grid, and was kicked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He regretted it the next day.&nbsp;</span><span style>He realized that he had lost control. Irene was just an unrequited crush, so how could he be angry at Grid for taking her away?&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner felt ashamed and sorry. He was worried about Grid’s reaction.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Surely he won’t refuse to make my item?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was well aware of what a narrow-minded person Grid was.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>So after the wedding, he stayed for three days at Khan’s smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to apologize to Grid for his actions and to ask for the production of his item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Grid never showed up in Khan’s smithy after his marriage.&nbsp;</span><span style>Khan knew the reason why. But he wouldn’t tell Vantner Grid’s whereabouts, no matter how he asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey, look Old Man. Why won’t you tell me where Grid went?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Didn’t you swear at Grid on his wedding day? I don’t want someone like you becoming involved with Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah, really...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan was a twisted old man. There was a reason why he was a good fit with Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner failed to find out Grid’s whereabouts for three days and eventually asked Jishuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Master, can you go and see Irene?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>You want me to ask about Grid’s whereabouts?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Yes...</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-Okay.</span></i> <i><span style>I also think that now is the time for Grid to work.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Tzedakah Guild recruited Grid because they needed his blacksmith abilities. Grid also joined the guild to act as a blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span style>As the guild master, Jishuka had to remind Grid of his duties.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She went to see Irene.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then she was shocked by Irene’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? Grid... No, Viscount Grid has gone to defeat the Guardian of the Forest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. He said that he wants to defeat the Guardian of the Forest for our sake. Isn’t he like Prince Charming? So cool.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...This is a headache.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like other games, Satisfy was a thoroughly competitive society.&nbsp;</span><span style>All users and guilds struggled for their own interests.&nbsp;</span><span style>One of the easiest ways for a guild to profit was to control a hunting ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guilds controlled hunting grounds where honey flowed and prohibited outsiders from entering. This was called guild monopolization.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a natural occurrence.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Tzedakah Guild also controlled two hunting grounds around Bairan without opening them to outsiders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first place was Ruger Dungeon where monsters over level 250 appeared, and the second place was the Grey Forest where the Guardian of the Forest appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Guardian of the Forest was very strong. It was a level 245 field boss, but it was stronger than a dungeon boss. Its stats were abnormally high and it had a wide range of CC and summoning skills, making it very difficult to deal with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It also possessed a passive skill to reduce physical damage and along with its natural defense and health, it took the current Tzedakah Guild at least three hours to defeat it.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid only led 100 soldiers and two knights to the Guardian of the Forest raid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was also during this cycle!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The Awakened Guardian of the Forest is several times stronger than the normal Guardian of the Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blue orichalcum is a mineral born with the power of moonlight and the Guardian of the Forest.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was that why?&nbsp;</span><span style>The Guardian of the Forest and blue orichalcum were very sensitive to moonlight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once every four months, the two full moons would rise at the same time and the blue orichalcum, which made up most of the Guardian of the Forest, would show an infinite power and awaken the guardian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, it was the awakening cycle.&nbsp;</span><span style>Four months ago, the Tzedakah Guild wasn’t aware of this and was annihilated after challenging the Awakened Guardian of the Forest.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Awakened Guardian of the Forest had significantly less health and defense than the normal one, but it exerted overwhelming attack power and agility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is much stronger than a pope, who was a priest. This time, Grid can’t avoid death.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the Tzedakah Guild have given up on the Guardian of the Forest raid during this awakening period. Therefore, they didn’t bother controlling the Grey Forest. They planned to try the Awakened Guardian of the Forest raid in four months.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how she thought about it, the odds of Grid succeeding in the raid alone was 0%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is better.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Grid ever participated in the guild’s community, Grid would’ve found out that the guild monopolized the Guardian of the Forest raid and would’ve been able to ask for the blue orichalcum that he wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he didn’t. His ignorance of the guild community and his insistence on personal activities led to this.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka hoped that Grid’s habit would be fixed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>She wanted him to realize the importance of the guild community with this incident and hoped that he would refrain from personal activities in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of Khan’s smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really, that Grid...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner clicked his tongue after receiving Jishuka’s explanation through a whisper. He wanted to help Grid, but it was impossible because he was too far away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He will be angry from the experience loss after dying and might not want to make my item...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A man arrived at the smithy while Vantner was feeling worried.&nbsp;</span><span style>Khan, who only treated Vantner badly, enthusiastically welcomed the man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh! Hasn’t it been a really long time? Has it been a few months?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s good to see you. Has My Liege been well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huh, you haven’t heard the news about him these days? He’s become tremendously successful. Now he is once again on a brave raid...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan suddenly paused in his conversation and whispered in the man’s ears.&nbsp;</span><span style>What was he saying? The man was happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected from My Liege... Really amazing. He tried to run away from the frostlight orc chief and now he is raiding a monster alone? I will go to meet him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man said goodbye to Khan and exited the smithy. Then he blew a whistle, riding the drake that was called and soaring into the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve never seen that ID among the rankers who use drakes as pets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was a new rookie popping up again?&nbsp;</span><span style>The stagnant Vantner became frustrated.</span></p>
