 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The Yak Guild’s master, Bubat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He combined bold judgments and powerful CCs to be called Satisfy’s best initiator.&nbsp;</span><span style>The battlefield was always favorable to his allies when he was fighting in the lead. His nickname was ‘Yak who Promises Victory.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But at the time of the National Competition, Bubat was helpless. He didn’t live up to his reputation and disappointed people.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was it because he was in a bad condition?&nbsp;</span><span style>No.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because he met Yura and Grid in succession.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the case of Yura, his CC was destroyed by her excellent physical abilities. Grid was too bad because he resisted all CCs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bubat was frustrated because it couldn’t be helped.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now it was a few months later.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bubat tried.&nbsp;</span><span style>He raised his level during hunting, acquired new skills, and maximized his control. He had the ability to fight against Yura and Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he were to face them again, he had the confidence to grab hold of their ankles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However,</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dammit...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he met Yura and Grid, he once again experienced helplessness and frustration.&nbsp;</span><span style>For Bubat, reality was terrible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Ashur ridiculed him,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Your skills are pathetic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bubat couldn’t say anything to the Earl’s words.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Ashur was really brilliant.&nbsp;</span><span style>Regardless of his skill, his ability to respond with appropriate magic was beyond the scope of common sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>In this battle, Bubat was already wounded, while Earl Ashur didn’t have a single speck of dirt on his white robes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the continent’s 10 great magicians.&nbsp;</span><span style>A monster who deterred war just by being present.&nbsp;</span><span style>In modern society, he was equivalent to a nuclear warhead. However, he was more than the rumors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Far stronger than Yura.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t an exaggeration.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Earl Ashur and Yura had the same level and stats, Earl Ashur would have the advantage.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was the named NPC compensation effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Named NPCs that had a profound effect on the worldview and story of the game, like Earl Ashur, had all their abilities (attack, defense, magic power, health, mana, skill cooldown, etc) set higher than a user.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a type of protection system applied as a fixed effect, regardless of stats.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Ashur and Piaro were both named NPCs, but because it was divided by grade, Earl Ashur was defeated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not someone that small fries like you can dare to look at.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kurururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In one hand, lightning.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suuuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In the other hand, Earl Ashur manifested water vapor.&nbsp;</span><span style>The destructive power of a magician who mastered various types of attribute magic became more evident when dealing with a large group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will bury your bones in this city. Your bodies will be fertilizer to help the roses bloom.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwarururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The water vapor spread and a thunderstorm formed.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Yak and Zeraph Guild members that were in range were electrocuted.&nbsp;</span><span style>Arrows from the soldiers poured from above them like rain while the knights continued the onslaught.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ohhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The top-ranked players, including Bubat, fought desperately. They overcame the electric shock as soon as possible and smashed the knights.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, Bubat’s activities were dazzling. He was like an angry yak as he blew away two knights with his shoulders.&nbsp;</span><span style>The knight with a blue rose in his mouth, Dio was only able to compete with him for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Bubat was still insignificant in Earl Ashur’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Planning to invade Reidan with such skills, you should reevaluate. Don’t you know? There is a monster at Reidan.” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttaak. Hwaruruk!</span></i> <i><span style>Hwaruk!</span></i> <i><span style>Hwaruk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Ashur started to generate continuous fire arrows from his fingers.&nbsp;</span><span style>He proved that C-grade magic could be as overwhelming as A-grade magic with his speed and magic power. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>People burned like straw.&nbsp;</span><span style>The earth shook and a storm appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>The unrealistic scene of two of the seven guilds representing Satisfy collapsing was recorded by Bunny Bunny in high definition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Amazing...! Amazing! Puhahaha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the 10 great magicians on the continent was protecting Grid!&nbsp;</span><span style>Bunny Bunny was convinced that he could break his record of maximum viewers with this broadcast. He would also be inundated with interview requests from various media.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wouldn’t be long before he returned to his days as the world’s best gaming BJ.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Ku... Kuock...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Flower Guild’s last survivor, Reis.&nbsp;</span><span style>The struggling man eventually collapsed.&nbsp;</span><span style>One of the seven guilds had been completely wiped out by Faker.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why did something so ridiculous happen?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The timing worked out well for Faker.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the time when the difference between the third and second advancement classes was beginning to emerge.&nbsp;</span><span style>Out of the 30 Ice Flower Guild members, only Bondre had a third advancement class.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, it meant Bondre was the only one able to face Faker.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Bondre was a magician.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Faker was an assassin, so he perfectly countered Bondre.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the difference in classes. This difference meant that the Ice Flower Guild was easily handled by Faker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It might’ve been different if this moment occurred three months ago. Or after some more time.&nbsp;</span><span style>No matter how great Faker was, he wouldn’t have been able to smash the Ice Flower Guild then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your stamina is depleted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You won’t be able to take any action.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Flop!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Faker sat on the ground like a puppet whose strings were cut.&nbsp;</span><span style>Master of Swiftness had a fatal weakness.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was fast moving, but the stamina consumption rate was unmatched.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a difficult challenge to overcome. Grid was trying to solve it somehow, but the result was still unknown.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Shake shake.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Faker got up with great difficulty.&nbsp;</span><span style>His stamina was fixed at zero.&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite finding it difficult to lift even one finger, he attempted to move his feet with the belief that he should protect Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Only me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Based on the conversation of the Ice Flower Guild members, the fore invading Reidan was the seven guilds.&nbsp;</span><span style>Faker knew that Reidan was empty due to the Overgeared members being busy with the mine development, so there was no one else able to defend Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Flop!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Faker couldn't move a single step and fell to the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>Stamina depletion wasn’t a problem that could be overcome with mental power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would’ve been nice if he was the one here right now.&nbsp;</span><span style>Faker was sad.&nbsp;</span><span style>His expressionless face distorted with despair and frustration.&nbsp;</span><span style>Suddenly, the hiding Ul Clan ran over to him with worried expressions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first, they were afraid of Faker. However, now they trusted him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On this day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faker became a legend.&nbsp;</span><span style>A living god who exterminated one of the seven guilds alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was extremely natural that having a famous subordinate would increase Grid’s reputation.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Just before Faker attacked the Ice Flower Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>Faker sent a shocking whisper to Lauel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>The seven guilds are heading to Reidan.</span></i> <i><span style>The Ice Flower Guild’s currently location is the thorny vine forest.</span></i> <i><span style>In addition, I don’t know the location of the other six guilds.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a massive raid when Reidan was empty?&nbsp;</span><span style>It meant that the enemies accurately grasped Reidan’s situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I was too relaxed.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had to be more thorough when it came to blocking spies. But he didn’t, so this was all his fault. He was incompetent as the lord’s representative.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaduduk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He was angry at himself.&nbsp;</span><span style>Indeed, a lot of people were trying to restrain Reidan, but he couldn’t stop this situation anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel didn’t want to communicate this to Grid, who trusted him and put everything into his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit...! Shit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lauel? What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alzar Mountain.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members, who were clearing the monsters around the mine, heading over to Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel was rarely so agitated, so they felt anxiety.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel took a deep breath and explained the situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>“The seven guilds are heading to Reidan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members cried out with shock. Among them, Vantner was especially angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Those damn bastards...! Damn! What should we do? It will take at least half a day to get to Reidan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel turned his attention to Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huroi, how many people can board your drake?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Three people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Given the speed of a drake, they would be able to reach Reidan in three hours.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel examined the Overgeared members.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was to select two people that would arrive in Reidan first with Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was regrettable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The strongest members of the Overgeared Guild, Pon and Regas were off on the dungeon mission (and incommunicado), while Faker was on a private mission. Jishuka was all the way in Bairan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the next most powerful...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Vantner and Toon. Please move to Reidan first with Huroi. If the enemies haven’t invaded yet when you arrive, cooperate with Jude to increase the defense. If they are already in battle...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel stopped speaking and closed his eyes. Then he spoke difficult words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Discard Reidan. Focus on saving Khan, Rabbit, Piaro, and Jude.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a realistic judgment.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was virtually impossible to resist the seven guilds with a small number of people.&nbsp;</span><span style>They needed to be prepared for the destruction of the internal facilities. For now, the priority was saving the people who shouldn’t be lost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I understand...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, Vantner wanted to say, &nbsp;‘Why should we give up on Reidan?’ He wanted to shout that he would protect Reidan on his own.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Lauel was acting on behalf of Grid. Vantner chose to remain silent and obey the command.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because Vantner recognized Grid as his leader.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let's go!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi, Vantner, and Toon boarded the drake and began their journey to Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>The remaining members moved with Lauel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let’s go. Don’t worry about your stamina and mana. Our goal is to arrive at Reidan quickly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reidan would already be ashes when they arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We must kill the invaders."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid would be the first user to become king. He was off limits.&nbsp;</span><span style>The enemies dared to aim at him?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>There were no thoughts about forgiveness.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zibal looked at the vast wheat fields with derision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Developing such a large city as an agricultural city, Grid has no talent for internal affairs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, Grid was incompetent. The only thing he could boast of was that he had a legendary class.&nbsp;</span><span style>The user who could become the first king?&nbsp;</span><span style>Not this guy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"First of all, shall we turn these fields to ashes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were many guilds that hadn’t arrived yet, but Zibal didn’t care.&nbsp;</span><span style>He instructed the magicians to burn everything with fire magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Four farmers appeared.</span></p>
