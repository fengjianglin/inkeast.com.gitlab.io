 <p><i><span style>Syuok!</span></i> <i><span style>Syu syu syu syu syuk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The seven golden blades simultaneously aimed at his eyes, cheeks, head and chin.&nbsp;</span><span style>The speed was equivalent to Memphis, who was the fastest in hell, so the demonkin would be unable to react.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Hell Gao was one of the 33 great demons, so he didn’t think of it as a threat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'The human might be skilled at throwing, but this is just at the level of a pest.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He drew a small circle with his staff.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaeeeeeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The seven blades didn’t reach the target and scattered all over the place. However, they didn’t fall towards the ground. Instead, they flew up again and attacked Hell Gao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Huh?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao was amazed.&nbsp;</span><span style>He thought the seven golden blades had been thrown by the human in red armor, but they were moving by themselves?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kaang!</span></i> <i><span style>Kakakang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The golden blades that continued flying at Hell Gao were annoying. He decided to destroy them and firmly hit one with his staff.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the blade was fine and didn’t even get one scratch. It stiffened for a while before moving again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Outstanding durability. Is it adamantium? But why are they moving on their own?'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fast and solid gold blades!&nbsp;</span><span style>They weren’t controlled by magic, so how did they move by themselves?&nbsp;</span><span style>They didn’t tire, and gave Hell Gao a feeling of pressure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Get lost!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao released hot wind all over the place.&nbsp;</span><span style>The golden blades were pushed by the wind pressure and could no longer approach him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Come back."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The human in red armor watched from a distance and gave them orders.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the golden blades flew to him and started to rotate around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What a bizarre artifact.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I never dreamed in my thousands of years of existence that I would have a question for a human. Those blades, what are they? They have a durability comparable to the god mineral adamantium and they move by themselves? Why is an ordinary human carrying something like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ordinary human?”&nbsp;</span><span style>The human in red armor, Grid, grinned at him.&nbsp;</span><span style>“You still think I’m ordinary?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What?"&nbsp;</span><span style>Hell Gao spoke cynically.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Kukuk! You only barely managed to wound this trash body! So what, you think that you are special?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao was the 9th strongest of the 33 great demons, but this was only applicable to hell.&nbsp;</span><span style>After being sealed by Sword Saint Muller 150 years ago, he had to borrow the body of a demonkin every time he appeared in the human world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, Hell Gao’s current body wasn’t originally his and he couldn’t exert his true strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was arrogant just because he managed to damage Hell Gao a little bit, so Hell Gao couldn’t help snorting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I know that you are a fairly strong human. But you aren’t particularly special.”&nbsp;</span><span style>The black flames around Hell Gao’s body flashed.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I only recognize the man called Muller. You’re just a trivial existence who can’t even reach Muller’s toes."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid remarked,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Ah, Sword Saint Muller? Wasn’t he the one who turned your body into a rag in the past?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao’s eyes narrowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What’s so funny?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The smiling Grid kindly explained to him.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I am in the same class as Muller. It’s laughable that you can’t see that. Well, today you will die again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao thought it was so absurd that it was funny.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuhahahaha! This crazy person is talking nonsense!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sword Saint Muller was such a great figure that he broke Hell Gao’s common sense, who had lived for thousands of years.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was a mortal who transcended a great demon.&nbsp;</span><span style>His swordsmanship was enough to cut through the flames of hell, making them look like sheep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In comparison, Grid was just plain. Grid was stronger than a normal human, but he was no match for Muller.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A person who puts himself in the same class as Muller, he really doesn’t understand... Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao stopped laughing as his gaze turned to a corner of the dungeon.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to the golden blades, he had missed the other human. That human was aiming the pickaxe at a fire stone.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Peak Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>The 16th ranked Peak Sword, who was a fearful person to some and a target of respect for others, was challenging the act of mining for the first time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao was furious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t like this pair!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was able to bring four fire stones to the human world from hell. He lost a quarter of his magic power when one of them was taken. He couldn’t allow another fire stone to be mined.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao ran while the dark flames wrapped around his body like a cloak.&nbsp;</span><span style>His target was naturally Peak Sword. He wanted to smash Peak Sword’s head and destroy that pickaxe.&nbsp;</span><span style>But his path was blocked by Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are you going during our conversation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid attacked while talking.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao’s arms shook after he defended against the blue greatsword with his staff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It isn’t just that I’m weaker. He has grown stronger.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid spoke to the somewhat shaken Hell Gao.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Of course, my current skills aren’t even one-hundredth of Sword Saint Muller’s skills. But it isn’t a lie that I am in the same class as him. I am also a legend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Legend?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao spoke in a confused voice.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid wielded a master weapon that had been enhanced to +9, and his utilization of it was already at 100% after several months of experience.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjang!</span></i> <i><span style>Jjejejeok!</span></i> <i><span style>Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Pagma’s Swordsmanship (Lv.2) increased physical attacks by 30%, critical hit rate by 20% and critical damage by 10%.&nbsp;</span><span style>The power of the +9 Failure combined with Pagma’s Swordsmanship was truly beyond imagination!&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s power brought confusion to Hell Gao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'This guy, the attack power in one blow...!’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Kkuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao defended against the attack with his staff, and eventually threw up.&nbsp;</span><span style>A red light shone in the black flames and Grid grinned, revealing his white teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you feel it? This is strong enough to fill up the difference in abilities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao finally felt alarmed.&nbsp;</span><span style>The man in front of him, he wasn’t a master of swordsmanship like Muller was. His comprehensive physical abilities were far below Muller’s.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Strong.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why was he so strong?&nbsp;</span><span style>Hell Gao’s suspicious gaze was fixed on Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s that greatsword.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had lived for thousands of years, but he had never seen a weapon like this blue greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hell Gao trembled.&nbsp;</span><span style>The golden blades that moved by themselves and this powerful greatsword, how did the man in front of him gobble up such powerful items?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Does this person have the treasures of the gods?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao could no longer take it easy and needed to fight with all his strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hell Gao made a decision and shot out hellfire.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The flames that wouldn’t fade away once they started burning hit Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hell Gao confirmed that Grid’s chest was burning and burst out laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuhahaha! It’s useless even if you jump into the sea right now. Once the hellfire has started burning, it won’t fade away until the target has been turned to ashes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao didn’t doubt that Grid would become ashes within seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style>However...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It turned off?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid waved a few times and the hellfire was extinguished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>How did you turn off hellfire like it was a match fire?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the moment when Hell Gao’s common sense that ‘hellfire will never go out’ was broken in his thousands of years of living.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yes, the last time his common sense was broken was when he met Muller 150 years ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'It isn’t a lie that he is in the same class as Muller...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao felt a chill and reflexively took a step back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 4,800 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The black fires of hell have attached to your body. The flames won’t turn off until your body is turned to ashes.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You will receive 2,000 burn damage per second until death.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid felt pleasure as he confirmed the warning windows and started a dance.&nbsp;</span><span style>White light moved around the blue greatsword, like a shark swimming in the sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Link.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The muscles that squeezed during the dance were released at once. At the same time, the greatsword moved explosively.&nbsp;</span><span style>17 blue and white energy blades sped through the air at a terrible speed before compressing the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was quiet.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Only the sound of Peak Sword swinging the pickaxe was heard.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hell Gao had doubts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps it was a vain attack?&nbsp;</span><span style>And.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Susuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The 17 strands of energy were drawn around Hell Gao’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was followed by 17 sharp waves.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pipit!</span></i> <i><span style>Pipipipipit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The air that was compressed simultaneously exploded.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the same time, 17 wounds appeared on Hell Gao’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao belatedly screamed.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t a missed attack. This was the true dignity of the sword of light, Link.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the moment that Grid, who raised his stats and level to 246 during the past four months, perfectly reproduced one of Pagma’s sword techniques.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Didn't I tell you? I am also a legend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was even more impressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T-This guy...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao’s body started wobbling.&nbsp;</span><span style>Before the fire stone was collected and Hell Gao was in perfect condition, a fatal strike barely decreased his health. Now he lost more than a tenth of his health the moment he was hit by Link.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was convinced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is enough to fight.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i> <i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of Peak Sword’s pickaxe was heard non-stop from the rear and Grid felt more courageous.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then from a corner of his field of view, Hell Gao’s staff came flying.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[You have been hit by a lethal blow!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 7,930 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was perfectly hit by the staff that moved between the rotating golden blades.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hell Gao shouted while chanting a spell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You aren’t Muller!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right. He wasn’t Sword Saint Muller. One strike from his sword had caused Hell Gao’s limbs to fall off.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was true that Grid’s weapons covered his deficiency, but it couldn’t be denied that he was very lacking compared to Muller.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The seven golden blades moved briskly to contain Hell Gao, while protecting Grid at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Hell Gao was in complete combat mode and was very fast and powerful.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The golden blades that Hell Gao struck were stuck in place for two seconds and then,</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao’s staff moved flexibly, avoiding the other golden blades and striking Grid’s abdomen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 3,550 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Damn! It hurts!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of Grid’s armor had been enhanced to +6. He had to spend a tremendous amount to enhance Failure up to +9, so he had to be satisfied with this much for his armor.&nbsp;</span><span style>But after many tests, he thought that his current defense was enough.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>A month ago, he had faced the Awakened Guardian of the Forest and found his defense quite bearable.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Hell Gao’s attack power was too strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is after he was weakened by having the fire stone mined...!’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeok!</span></i> <i><span style>Peeeeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 3,590 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 3,480 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 4,900 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have been hit by a lethal blow!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 7,700 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The chances of a critical hit were tremendous high.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was one critical hit in every three blows. Hell Gao’s basic damage was also tremendous. His crazed behavior restrained Grid’s actions.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid barely survived with one-third of his health and fought back with Failure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid used the repulsive force generated by the collision with the staff to open a distance, then he used a skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A blue and white wave spread out around him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 18,500 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The target’s attack speed has reduced.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao’s overwhelming momentum that Grid couldn’t overcome was noticeably reduced.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid counterattacked a few times during this gap while shouting to Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, this damn guy! You still haven’t mined one fire stone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword was frustrated,&nbsp;</span><span style>"I told you that it is my first time mining! I don’t know the tricks!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah, it’s frustrating!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao was the master of hellfire, while Grid was the first legendary class.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was such a large difference between Peak Sword and them, and he was frustrated at not proving his reputation as 16th on the unified rankings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid explained to Peak Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Take a good look around the fire stones! There is a part around the root where the ground will be weak, attack that place...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shut up.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Hundreds of spheres of hellfire flew.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid took out the Divine Shield and defended with it and the golden blades.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Teook!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao struck the ground with his staff. He leapt using the rebound and landed over Grid’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The golden knives mercilessly stabbed Hell Gao. But he couldn’t stop Hell Gao’s actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Hell Gao grabbed Grid’s head with both hands and shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you can’t burn then I will crush you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Black flames emanated from both of Hell Gao’s hands and swirled crazily.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuhahahahaha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even a rock would quickly be turned to sand from this heat, let alone Grid!&nbsp;</span><span style>Hell Gao laughed as he anticipated flesh and brains to splatter everywhere.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t see it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid pulled out a blue ring and put it on his finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha...! Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The voice of the man who should’ve died was heard perfectly.&nbsp;</span><span style>As Hell Gao was surprised, Grid used Blacksmith's Rage and cut off both of Hell Gao’s hands with the +9 failure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Failure’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘Bisect’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 46,940 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have cut both wrists of Hell Gao, the master of hellfire. Hell Gao’s actions will be limited and his attack power and attack speed will be greatly reduced.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaack!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao’s terrible screams echoed in the wide dungeon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smiled wickedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the second round.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had accumulated a lot of combat experience and he learned how to take advantage of Doran’s Ring. For example, he would wear the ring when the enemy used a powerful skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This maximized the effect of Doran’s Ring and the Holy Light Armor. On the other hand, Hell Gao’s health was reduced by three-tenths after Grid consecutively used Kill, Transcended Link, Link and Wave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then just in time.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes! Success! I gathered a fire stone!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword, who had been playing Satisfy for a year and a half, felt the pleasure of mining for the first time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk...! You guys...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black flames around Hell Gao’s body lost more momentum.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t doubt it.&nbsp;</span><span style>The second round would be a KO win.</span></p>
