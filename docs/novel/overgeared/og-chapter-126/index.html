 <p></p>
 <p>“Ugh!”</p>
 <p><span style>Grid felt pain and stumbled the moment the ray of light pierced his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 14,560 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have lost 52% of your health from a single blow.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>His vision was blurry.&nbsp;</span><span style>A normal person would be in a stunned state, but Grid was fine.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then a green light emerged from the blue ring on his finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The effect of Doran’s Ring has been activated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[7,280 health has been restored.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doran’s Ring immediately restored half of his lost health!&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to that effect, the injury in his heart area quickly recovered. Grid seemed like he would collapse but he quickly stood upright.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What...?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pope was caught off guard as the +8 Ideal Dagger pierced his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pope’s face was dismayed as he spat out black blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is this situation?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pope couldn’t believe it.&nbsp;</span><span style>He thought it was finished the moment he penetrated the heart of the masked bastard, but rather than dying, Grid fought back?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This monster...! Goddess’ Breath!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pope barely managed to recover his spirit and heal himself. He regained all his health and kicked Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was intended to open a distance so he could use magic, but Grid wouldn’t permit the pope to leave. The pope was a priest, so he would have weak physical abilities.&nbsp;</span><span style>After avoiding the pope’s kick, Grid grabbed his ankle and laughed grimly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You, did you think you could get away?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A chill went down the pope’s spine as his ankle was caught.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok...! Let me go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t let go!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pakak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid hit the struggling pope’s face. Then he firmly grabbed the pope’s shoulders and pushed him hard. The pope fell to the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s mad eyes could be seen through the helmet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s experiment with how long you can keep healing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This guyyyy!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk!</span></i> <i><span style>Puk puk.</span></i> <i><span style>Puk puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 7,500 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 6,980 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 7,330 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A critical hit was activated every time he precisely stabbed the dagger into the pope’s heart.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid burst out laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Puhahahahat! Die! Die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaaack!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Red blood spurted.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a horrible sight.&nbsp;</span><span style>The man in the bizarre skull helmet climbed onto the pope’s body and stabbed the pope with a dagger, causing blood and flesh to scatter all over the place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The pope’s sharp screams and the helmeted man’s creepy laughter filled the place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“U-Uwaaah...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The paladins and priests turned pale.&nbsp;</span><span style>Right now, the helmeted man in front of them was a butcher and the pope was a beast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The beast was being slaughtered by the butcher.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Vatican, one of the most sacred places in the world, was being turned into a slaughterhouse in a manner of minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuweek!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The priest started to feel nauseous as they looked at the bloody pope.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>To them, the man in the skull helmet looked like a demon.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to punish the wicked pope, a greater evil had descended.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian was finally able to recall who the man in the helmet was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Him...! I knew he was somewhat familiar. He’s the butcher who appeared on TV a while ago.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The butcher in the bizarre skull helmet who smashed the Giant Guild in Winston!&nbsp;</span><span style>It was rumored that he was a psychopath, and Damian had no doubt about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He fights in such a terrible manner...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sight of the pope being unable to resist the dagger continuously stabbing his heart wasn’t pleasant. In addition, the eerie light coming from the helmet made it creepier.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, the pope couldn’t believe the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He reigned over 70 million people, and even kings bowed to him! As an agent of the goddess, he was one of the most divine people in the world!&nbsp;</span><span style>Now he was being humiliated by a trivial guy whose identity was unknown!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The furious pope once again released light magic around himself.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid judged that it wouldn’t be safe to be swept away by that power and hurriedly pulled away from the pope.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 12,600 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have lost 45% of your health from a single blow.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was completely impossible to avoid the light power pouring out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeok!</span></i> <i><span style>Jjejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Frostlight Orc Chief’s Helmet, that was tinged with red due to the pope’s blood, started cracking. Grid’s face was almost completely revealed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the pope shouted a new magic spell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Goddess’ Wrath!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Papat!</span></i> <i><span style>Papapat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Two large gold circles, approximately 3m in diameter, was quickly created behind the pope’s back.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vast amounts of energy was coming from it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid became alert as mana was emitted from the magic circles.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was like watching an anti-tank gun.&nbsp;</span><span style>The light magic power emitted from the circles was 10 times greater and stronger than the power of light used by the pope.&nbsp;</span><span style>It seemed able to destroy anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is the strongest divine magic! You won’t be able to withstand this damage!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rin, who knew better than anyone that Everiel’s Shield was the only thing that could defend against it, shouted urgently.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid didn’t back down.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would show the peak of his item effects!&nbsp;</span><span style>He deployed the pavranium, the most powerful mineral that transcended the mineral of the gods.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Two small golden discs emerged and faced the huge white flash.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The ground shook.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The Vatican, which had endured for 500 years, started to collapse.&nbsp;</span><span style>The priests and paladins screamed as pillars fell over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rin-chan!”&nbsp;</span><span style>In the midst of the confusion, Damian rushed forward and hugged Rin. Then he protected Rin from the stones falling from the ceiling.&nbsp;</span><span style>“A-Are you okay? Rin-chan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damian...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rin felt something strange as she looked at the bloody Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style>She felt a yearning for the warmth of his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me too...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rin existed only as a means to defend the pope and church, and this was her first experience of being protected by someone. Thus, Rin summoned Ikael’s Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me too...! I will fight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had been lethargic and helpless after being abandoned by the church, but now she was filled with determination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If this is the goddess’ will, I will follow! Punish the corrupt pope and rebuilt the Vatican! And Damian, with you, I will lead the Rebecca Church to the right path again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rin-chan...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A flag was planted!&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian flushed as he felt thrilled, then Isabel appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rin! Are you okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had just finished subduing Luna.&nbsp;</span><span style>Isabel had worried about Rin’s safety after witnessing the collapse of the Vatican.&nbsp;</span><span style>Had she lost her life to the pope?&nbsp;</span><span style>Isabel imagined the worst situation and ran, but fortunately, Rin was safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>She was relieved to the point where tears flowed down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rin shouted firmly.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Isabel! I will defeat His Holiness! He has sinned! It’s what the goddess wants!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel nodded.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Yes...! Let’s join forces!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment that the strongest paladins decided to punish the pope.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the center of the collapsed debris of the Vatican!&nbsp;</span><span style>A voice was heard from within the smoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My prey... Don't take it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>His helmet and armor were destroyed because of the shockwave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn bastard! I will make you pay for the value of my items!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other side, the pope’s shocked voice was heard.&nbsp;</span><span style>"How did you stop the Goddess’ Wrath...? What are those golden discs?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The throne where only the pope could sit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The pope was sitting down with exhaustion. His usual dignity was gone and his hair was matted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid grabbed Dainsleif.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian saw that he was trying to fight again and hurriedly used Light's Blessing.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Shaaaaaah.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dainsleif started to be surrounded by a golden light.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the precursor to Dainsleif’s skill, Golden Flash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ohhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid squeezed out all the power of Dainsleif and a golden flash flew through the remnant of the Vatican towards the pope.&nbsp;</span><span style>Until then, all of Grid’s attacks were physical so the pope was astonished after using a shield that protected against physical attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Magic power...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right. The Golden Flash was a skill that deal damage proportional to his magic power to all targets in a straight line.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had no reason to use it since his strength was much higher than his intelligence. However, he used it with exquisite timing in this moment to penetrate through the shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pope screamed with pain!&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Grid fired Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Link.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The level of Link has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your damage will increase. The number of times a target is hit will increase by 5 times.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the first time since acquiring Pagma’s Swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had used it hundreds of times and it now had finally reached level 2. Now 17 linked strikes cut at the pope’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Goddess’ Protection!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pope barely managed to use a skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>A pale green translucent shield was deployed to protect his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pope smiled with satisfaction as he unleashed a counterattack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a widespread emission of light magic power so it was impossible to defend against with just two discs of pavranium. The pavranium couldn’t protect Grid and Grid suffered a great deal of damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Grid didn’t fall down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 13,000 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 9,500 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A legend doesn’t die easily. You can resist all attacks for 5 seconds with a minimum of health.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What...?! What the hell are you? Why won’t you fall?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pope cried out in frustration as he tried to use a healing spell. However, he was both physically and mentally exhausted, and most of his magic power was consumed by Goddess’ Wrath. It was impossible to use magic smoothly.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, he couldn’t do anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid unfolded his sword dance as he shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Am a legend! Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The level of Kill has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your damage will greatly increase.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The pope grasped the last of his magic power and barely managed to deploy a shield. Then the huge greatsword penetrated the pope’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Cou...gh! You...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Red bloodshot eyes stared at Grid as the pope coughed up blood. Then the pope gradually turned into a grey light.&nbsp;</span><span style>Numerous notification windows popped up in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have defeated the 13th Pope Drevigo, who was corrupting the Rebecca Church!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[500 gold has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Party leader ‘Grid’ has acquired the Goddess’ Essence.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Party leader ‘Grid’ has acquired the Holy Light Armor.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Party leader ‘Grid’ has acquired the Holy Light Gloves.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Party leader ‘Grid’ has acquired the Holy Light Crown.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[145,350,000 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
