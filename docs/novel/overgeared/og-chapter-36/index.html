 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as I opened my eyes the next morning, I connected to Satisfy and headed into the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Khan was waiting for me and I immediately complained to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why did you leave such a task to a stranger like Huroi? Am I worse than him? Huh? You should’ve left it to me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan looked like he didn’t know what I was talking about, before making a belated expression of understanding.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Are you talking about the mission to tell Earl Steim about Winston?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Huhu</span></i><span style>, Khan gave a hearty laugh and explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You are definitely a great young man. Despite your young age, you have great abilities and a sense of justice and sacrifice...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was he saying?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aren’t you willing to take a big risk for the residents of Winston that you have no ties with?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh? That wasn’t what I intended...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You don’t have to say anything. You are too modest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan misjudged me and turned me into an incredibly good guy!&nbsp;</span><span style>I had nothing to say, then Khan placed a hand on my shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I know that you are worried for Winston’s residents, but how can I put you at risk? You are already precious to me, just like a son. I can’t ask you to do something so dangerous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan’s eyes were warm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The Mero Company knows that you are close to me, so there will be a thorough surveillance. The Mero Company won’t stay still if they see you make any movements to leave Winston. I won’t be able to stand the grief if you get hurt by them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan sincerely cherished me. My heart thumped. I felt bad for misunderstanding Khan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Khan... I didn’t know your heart and thought you didn’t trust me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How can that be? I trust you more than anyone else. Isn’t that why I’m leaving the fate of the smithy to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I listened to him. I had no reason to doubt Khan in the first place.&nbsp;</span><span style>I felt ashamed while Khan spoke in a spirited tone,&nbsp;</span><span style>"You have to focus on the game! Show the Mero Company!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The date is decided?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right. It is in two days. We have to hone your skills! Let’s surprise everyone by polishing the legendary blacksmith skills that you have inherited!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Okay! My motivation shot upwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I understand. I will win the game!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Good spirit! I might not have the techniques but the experience I’ve accumulated in my life will be a great help to you! I will do my best to help!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From that day on, Khan and I raised my training.&nbsp;</span><span style>I repeated the production techniques, causing my skills to become more proficient and polished. I thoroughly learned about efficient movements and reduced any unnecessary movements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>My probability of making rare and epic items increased slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A rare rated item was produced, so all stats have permanently risen by +2 and reputation throughout the continent has risen by +30.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[An epic rated item was produced, so all stats have permanently risen by +4 and reputation throughout the continent has risen by +80.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your persistence has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your dexterity has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was also fun to raise my persistence and dexterity stats.&nbsp;</span><span style>But there was one drawback. It was the limitation in the materials.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan was totally broke and I was saving money, so I couldn’t obtain premium production materials. I only used the materials piled up in Khan’s warehouse, but most of the materials were inferior. Khan couldn’t get good ingredients because he was impeded by the Mero Company. Therefore, I couldn’t produce high-performance items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The higher the level and performance of the items produced, the faster the experience of my production skill would rise. Items with a low-level limit and low performance, even if they had a rare rating, meant my experience gain rate was slow and the value was cheap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Rare items should be sold to the stores, but I can sell the epic rated items to the users.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Usable Iron Sword]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 19/19 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 35~40 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Speed: +2%</span></p>
 <p><span style>A sword made by a craftsman with great skill and potential but lacking in experience and reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is easy to use because it has a perfect balance of length and weight. The user can attack a little faster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that this type of sword was made with meager materials is amazing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>User Restriction: Level 12 or higher. More than 30 strength. Beginner Sword Mastery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Unexpectedly Comfortable Rat Leather Armor]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 24/24 &nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 22 &nbsp;Movement Speed: +3%</span></p>
 <p><span style>An armor made of rat leather by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but lacks experience and reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is designed and created so that the wearer won’t be inconvenienced when moving. The wearer can move a little faster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that this type of armor was made with meager materials is amazing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>User Restriction: Level 13 or higher. Beginner Leather Armor Mastery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The names are crude but...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level 12 or 13 users would find hunting much easier if they wore this armor and weapon. They were items that low-level users could possess if they had enough gold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill] Lv 1 (12.7%)</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath] Lv 1 (8.9%)&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘When I made the Jaffa Arrow before, my experience increased by 3.7% and 2%. Instantly.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Certainly, I was disappointed that the experience of my production skills was slowly rising.&nbsp;</span><span style>But I didn’t care much.&nbsp;</span><span style>Regardless, my skills experience and production experience were rising, so I was satisfied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I wasn’t mistaken. </span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill is still only level 1, but I am now able to craft more items than I could before.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>My production speed and degree of completeness have improved.&nbsp;</span><span style>If the skill level of the Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill and my dexterity stat rose, my production ability would become even better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'But realistically, it is impossible to raise the skill level of the Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill anytime soon. Right now, the best thing I can do is to raise my dexterity stat.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The higher my dexterity, the higher the completeness of the item.&nbsp;</span><span style>I decided to invest my stat points into dexterity for a more solid victory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Status window.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Grid</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level: 21 (5,350/16,700)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Class: Pagma’s Descendant</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The probability of adding additional options when making items will increase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The probably of item enhancement will increase.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>* All equipment items can be worn unconditionally. However, there is a penalty depending on the rating of the item.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: One who Became a Legend</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Abnormal conditions don’t work well on you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* You won’t die when health is at the minimum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Easily acknowledged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Health: 936/936 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana: 177/177</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strength: 104 &nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 52 &nbsp;&nbsp;Agility: 96 &nbsp;Intelligence: 59&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dexterity: 99 &nbsp;Persistence: 60</span></p>
 <p><span style>Composure: 44 &nbsp;Indomitable: 50 &nbsp;&nbsp;Dignity: 44 &nbsp;&nbsp;Insight: 44</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stat Points: 130</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 842/3,080&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to the steady production of rare and epic items, my stats have risen dramatically. I had a huge 130 stat points.&nbsp;</span><span style>I contemplated on how to invest the stat points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'If I invest all my stat points in dexterity, will my production skill rise significantly? Obviously, there would be a huge effect. But if I concentrate too much on only one stat, I will regret it later.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I had to think carefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I put a lot of points into strength and agility the other day, so I don’t have to raise them anymore. I am currently lacking stamina, so wouldn’t it be nice to raise it? When dealing with strong enemies like the gangsters, it is better to have high vitality and defense.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I decided to start distributing my stat points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have invested 60 points in stamina. Is this correct?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Once the points are invested, it can’t be reversed. Do you want to proceed?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have invested 70 points in dexterity. Is this correct?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Once the points are invested, it can’t be reversed. Do you want to proceed?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop asking me and just do it. Status window!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Grid</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level: 21 (5,350/16,700)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Class: Pagma’s Descendant</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The probability of adding additional options when making items will increase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The probably of item enhancement will increase.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>* All equipment items can be worn unconditionally. However, there is a penalty depending on the rating of the item.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: One who Became a Legend</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Abnormal conditions don’t work well on you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* You won’t die when health is at the minimum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Easily acknowledged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Health: 1,536/1,536 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana: 177/177</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strength: 104 &nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 112 &nbsp;&nbsp;Agility: 96 &nbsp;Intelligence: 59&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dexterity: 169 &nbsp;Persistence: 60</span></p>
 <p><span style>Composure: 44 &nbsp;Indomitable: 50 &nbsp;&nbsp;Dignity: 44 &nbsp;&nbsp;Insight: 44</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stat Points: 0</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 842/3,080&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kukukuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I shook with joy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Anybody would be shocked if they could see my status window. How could a level 21 character have such stats? If I simply calculated the sum of all my stats, I was already beyond level 75.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strength, stamina, agility, and intelligence.&nbsp;</span><span style>If I only calculated these basic stats, it was close to level 40!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Now that I see it, isn’t a production class great for stats?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The benefit of raising all stats every time a higher grade item was made was common to all production-related classes, not just blacksmiths.&nbsp;</span><span style>Those who took advantage of this could overcome the disadvantage of production based jobs. Their insufficient combat skills could be supplemented with high stats.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, a large amount of labor was needed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I accept that labor is my life. My body is meant for labor! I will show you the power of labor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I swallowed bread and immersed myself in item production again. I didn’t lose any concentration until the day of the competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>As my character grew, I felt the same mental growth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A rare rated item was produced, so all stats have permanently risen by +2 and reputation throughout the continent has risen by +30.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuhahahahaha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I felt a pleasure that had never been felt when hunting and doing quests as a warrior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-What...? Am &nbsp;I dreaming right now? You, how have you improved your skills in such a short time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style>I couldn’t reply that ‘my rapid growth is from raising my dexterity stat’ so I just said,</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’m not your average genius.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan was thrilled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes! I forgot that you are Pagma’s Descendant. Huhu, I have a relationship with a legend who was born again. I will have no regrets after dying. Good! Shall I try harder?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In reality, it was raining continuously. So I always connected to Satisfy except when it was time to sleep. Thus, my growth was steady until the day of the competition.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, there were three epic classes in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>But except for the most recently appeared ‘Blood Warrior,’ there were no details about the others.&nbsp;</span><span style>The identity of the first epic class user was unknown, while the second one was said to be obtained by Agnus, 7th in the unified rankings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Satisfy users wondered about the identity of the two classes there were being kept strictly confidential. The related forums and broadcasters were engaged in a constant debate about the epic classes.&nbsp;</span><span style>But unless the relevant parties disclosed the information, it was only speculation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What type of class were the other two epic classes? Were they as impressive as the Blood Warrior that Katz got his hands on? Perhaps even more than that?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Eternal Kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style>Akero Dungeon that was near Frontier, Earl Steim’s capital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are too many monsters here. I barely managed to come all the way here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A beautiful blonde girl cried out.&nbsp;</span><span style>She looked like a fairytale princess, causing male users to approach her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Akero Dungeon is a place where even high-level users can’t hunt alone. Would you like to join our party? Our skills are very good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, you should join our party. We are very familiar with this dungeon and have acquired various know-hows. Our hunting speed is unmatched. You will definitely be satisfied if you join.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No! Come to our party! We will give you a lot of items!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy’s character wasn’t perfect fiction.&nbsp;</span><span style>When a character was created, it actually reflected the user’s real appearance. Only the skin tone and additional features such as hairstyle, tattoos, scars, and height could be changed a little bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, a beautiful person in Satisfy was generally beautiful in reality. That’s why the men favored beautiful girls over anything else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A rare beauty!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>'My ideal type!'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearts burst from their eyes as they looked at the girl.&nbsp;</span><span style>They seemed accustomed to competing over girls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you really want me to join the party? If so, try to hunt the monsters in front of me. I want to join a strong party. I will judge if your skills are strong and then join the party that I want.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this? She isn’t that special.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I agree. I would be thankful not to have a useless person join the party.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The female users talked badly about the girl. However, the male users became more attracted to the girl as their motivation shot up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ohhhhhh! Be sure to keep that promise! Heat Wave! Fire Sword!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beautiful girl. I will prove my strength. Swirling Frenzy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Bah, idiots. Can you do this? Steel Skin! One Point Break!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your skills don’t back up your bragging. Thunderbolt!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The male users ran towards the monsters and fired off their skills.</span></p>

 <p><span style>Strong skills such as a swirling storm, thunderbolts and flames emerged, causing the walls of the dungeon to shake.&nbsp;</span><span style>Fearsome monsters saw the strange scene and ran away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blonde girl, who was the cause of the confusion, watched the skills being cast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘That wind magic isn’t lacking compared to other magicians in the kingdom. It was indeed worthwhile to come here.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She used her unusually high insight stat and Skill Observation to detect the Swirling Frenzy skill and whispered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Skill Duplication."</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have successfully duplicated ‘Swirling Frenzy’ Lv.3.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The skill ‘Swirling Frenzy’ Lv. 3 is available to use once. You can keep it permanently until it is used.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Swirling Frenzy]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lv. 3</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creates a vortex that deals 1,530~2,380 damage per second for five seconds. The agility of the target caught in the vortex will decrease by 80%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Mana Cost: 700</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: 300 seconds&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blonde girl’s name was Euphemina.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her class was Duplicator.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a Duplicator, she used Skill Observation and Skill Duplication to instantly analyze and copy a skill used by the target. Whatever skill she copied, she could use it only once whenever she wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were disadvantages such as ‘the usage frequency of Skill Duplication is limited to three times a day.’ However, it was still a fraudulent skill despite the disadvantages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I can get Piaro with this.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina left the men showing off their skills at the dungeon behind. Then she moved quickly and arrived at Kesan Canyon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I found it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style> After finding a small cave at the end of the canyon, Euphemina read the contents of the quest once again in order to prepare her mind before entering.</span></p>
