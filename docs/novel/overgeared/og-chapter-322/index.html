 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was shaken when Transcend was blocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can’t believe it was defeated!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The number of times he had fired the energy blades in 30 seconds was well over 50 times.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Piaro stood in place and blocked it with a hand plow?&nbsp;</span><span style>He recognized Piaro’s skill from the beginning, but his agility seemed higher than yesterday.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Truly amazing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid felt a thrill.&nbsp;</span><span style>He realized that he was blessed to have such a great subordinate.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid didn’t like that Piaro was a farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style>His subordinate would become much stronger if he was a sword saint!</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Now I will make you a sword saint!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid rushed forward towards Piaro while avoiding the dozens of seeds. He used Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Pinnacle that could only be performed once an hour.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the result fell short of expectations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 10,500 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Ah! Damn level system!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro’s stats were high and the level difference of 100 was too much. His attack power wasn’t properly applied, catching Grid’s ankles.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he didn’t feel despair.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had the power of items!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is impossible to win with skills alone!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid faced the incoming hand plow and finally summoned a God Hand, defending by equipping the Divine Shield.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro was greatly surprised by the sight.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid smiled at the sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me show you the power of items.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[God Hand]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Unique (Growth)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: Infinite</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dexterity: 814 &nbsp;Strength: 813</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hand made by the legendary blacksmith Grid, using the material pavranium that was made by the former legends Pagma and Braham.&nbsp;</span><span style>Since it reproduces Grid’s hands, all items can be worn without restrictions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An item born from the intervention of three legends, it has the ability to transcend a divine item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, steady learning is essential in order to open up its potential.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The unique rated ‘God Hand’ only receives 30% of its master’s strength and dexterity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The unique rated ‘God Hand’ isn’t yet able to reproduce its master’s skills.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the skills possessed by items can be fully used. Buff skills will influence the master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* ‘God Hand’ can learn blacksmithing, swordsmanship and shield techniques.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, the Blacksmith skill of God Hand is advanced level 1, while Sword Mastery and Shield Mastery are beginner level 2. Once the mastery reaches a certain level, the rating of God Hand will increase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Magic Missile (Enhanced) is attached. Due to the effect of the Water Clan King’s Tears, this spell is reproduced with 100% of its power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Depending on the usage, it is easy to obtain the favor of the opposite sex.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Conditions of Use: Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 21</span></p>
 <p><span style>The conditions of use was Grid rather than Pagma's Descendant.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a dedicated item exclusively for Grid, its performance and role fulfilled his expectations.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a high likelihood of growth.&nbsp;</span><span style>It might be comparable or exceed a myth rated item, so he was full of expectations for the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But there was one regrettable thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I was only able to make four.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was able to make five if he only reproduced the shape, but the pavranium consumption rate was too high once he had to make all the structures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Well, I still like it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t it still four hands more than other people?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid threw Failure and Grid’s Greatsword into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Forsaking a weapon during battle?&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro couldn’t understand Grid’s intentions and was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Perhaps...! There isn’t only one golden hand!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro’s gaze hurriedly turned towards the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>Two golden hands appeared and grabbed the greatswords.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro paled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it the time to look away?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid replaced the Divine Shield with the Ideal Dagger, then he shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cut!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Papat!</span></i> <i><span style>Papapat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The speed of the pavranium was comparable to hell’s best demonic beast, a memphis. An ordinary person wouldn’t be able to react.&nbsp;</span><span style>Three God Hands approached and wielded their greatswords and daggers at Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>The golden hands were moving and wielding their weapons by themselves.&nbsp;</span><span style>They might be fast and amazing, but their sword skills were terrible.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was like child’s play to Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This isn’t the end!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro blocked all the hand attacks with just one hand plow!&nbsp;</span><span style>He tried to aim the hoe at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘There was one more hand!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A chill went down Piaro’s spine. A golden hand holding a jade greatsword aimed at his back!&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid realized it the moment he saw Piaro sense and defend against the attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The current God Hands can’t go against Piaro.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was a monster who blocked all attacks, even if they struck simultaneously from all four directions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But it is okay.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The presence of the God Hands alone were a great help to him.&nbsp;</span><span style>The swordsmanship and strength were low, but all the items were top rated weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro was forced to be conscious of them, and Grid would aim for that gap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I will do my best.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was covered in black energy.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the manifestation of Blackening that belonged to Dark Bus’ Earrings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your black magic power has increased.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You don’t have any black magic power. It will be replaced with demonic power.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[While Blackening is activated, your species will change to half-demon.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[As a half demon, your maximum health is reduced by 50%. Your attack power, magic power and agility will increased by 20% each.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[All attacks will be converted to the black magic attribute.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro’s eyes widened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Demonic energy!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>His lord wasn’t a human? He suspected for a moment.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he noticed that the cause of Grid’s demonic energy was the earrings he was wearing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro frowned despite feeling relieved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This doesn’t look good!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s skin was whitened and his eyes turned black, making his appearance unbearable.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro didn’t like that his lord was borrowing the power of a demon.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid wouldn’t hear of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t give it any big meaning. This is just an extension of the items system.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s nature was more aggressive in the Blackening state.&nbsp;</span><span style>How far would this power go against Piaro?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid felt pleasure as he gave an order to the hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After deploying Wind Blast attached to the Ideal Dagger, while Failure and the Doppelganger’s Greatsword simultaneously hit the left and right sides of Piaro. At this time, Grid’s Greatsword was falling from the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Where are you going?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The attacks towards Piaro weren’t threatening at all. They were easy to beat.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, he couldn’t help taking action towards them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Iyarugt.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid summoned the demonic sword that he got from the Elfin Stone raid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The demonic energy left an afterimage and a red line was painted.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘Unbelievable!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro was astonished.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s damage and speed was incomparable after he used Blackening. The speed wasn’t much different from Piaro. Moreover, Grid’s swordsmanship suddenly increased greatly.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was thanks to Iyarugt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Due to the option effect of Iyarugt, Sword Mastery has increased by 5 levels.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You don’t have the Sword Mastery skill. Beginner Sword Mastery level 5 is created while wearing Iyarugt.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It didn’t seem to be that much.&nbsp;</span><span style>What was the effect of beginner Sword Mastery level 5?&nbsp;</span><span style>It increased attack power and attack speed by 3% when a sword was worn.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid’s basic stats were unusually high. He was in a state where his stats were enhanced by Blackening.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>This 3% was forced to become a large number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, there was Iyarugt’s real strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The strongest enemy I have met in centuries! Go and fight! Fight without stopping! Let me grow!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style>The strongest demonkin when alive.&nbsp;</span><span style>His spirit dwelled in Iyarugt, transmitting his excitement to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>In Grid’s field of view, dozens of red lines were created and cleared.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid followed the most brilliant line and swung his sword. This became the best trajectory that put pressure on Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘My Lord...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro was thrilled as he confronted it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Since acquiring the title of great swordsman, how long had it been since he was pushed on the defensive by someone?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the first time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thus, he was glad.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was even more delighted that the opponent was his lord!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Free Farming 4th Style!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demonic sword was too sharp.&nbsp;</span><span style>Once the hand plow’s durability fell to the limit, he was forced to pull out a plow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Plow the Field!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As the plow swept through the ground, the earth shook like there was an earthquake and pillars of earth rose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid reflexively moved backwards and barely avoided the pillars. But the crisis was still continuing.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro sprinkled seeds on the land that was cleared. The seeds quickly grew into thorny vines that surrounded Grid’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the linkage of Plowing, Sowing and then Rapid Growth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“God Hands!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid quickly cried out as he was about to be overtaken by the front vines. Then four golden hands flow and swung their weapons, cutting through the thorns.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, there was a limit.&nbsp;</span><span style>The thorns grew faster than the hands could act.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Grid was forced to use Link in order to avoid the crisis.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the moment he wasted an important skill for defensive purposes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro leapt quickly and wielded his sickle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Free Farming 5th Style, Harvest!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i> <i><span style>Seokekeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The huge thorns were separated from the roots by the sickle. At the same time, they moved like a wave towards Grid’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 9,100 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 8,700 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 8,930 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It made him feel very bad.&nbsp;</span><span style>The problem was the skill name of ‘Harvest.’&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t want to die from a farmer’s sickle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Now!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iyarugt had been waiting for this opportunity and presented a new sword trajectory to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a sword trajectory that aimed perfectly for when Piaro landed.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid’s speed wasn’t fast enough to catch it. The distance to Piaro was too far.&nbsp;</span><span style>He did the next best thing and fired off four Magic Missiles, but he was interrupted by the thorns.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[What are you doing, incompetent bastard!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iyarugt urged him as he felt frustration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was baffled.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he came up with an idea.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the skill belonging to the Ideal Dagger that he forgot about for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“God Hands!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid shouted and the hand with the Ideal Dagger used the skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>Quick Movements was used.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your evasion rate is increased by 30% and your agility doubled for 1 minute.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why Grid kept the level 180 Ideal Dagger.&nbsp;</span><span style>Double his agility!&nbsp;</span><span style>The Ideal Dagger’s abilities were low, but the skill attached to it was great.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ohhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid rushed along the sword path.&nbsp;</span><span style>This speed overturned common sense, so there was no way for the confused Piaro to avoid it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A red flash was launched in a straight line towards Piaro’s shoulders. Originally, it was aimed at the heart. However, the orbit was twisted because of Piaro’s flail.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid wasn’t shaken.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because he knew his present speed far exceeded Piaro’s.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 3,900 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 3,790 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have succeeded in the 3rd combo!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The amount of damage the target will receive will increase by 200% for 1 second!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Now!’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A skill was launched with Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had the legendary skills so there was no sense not using them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 125,600 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro’s health fell by half in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Piaro has realized what he is lacking. The level of his farming techniques have risen from this enlightenment!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A hidden quest has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A quest window appeared to increase the value of this match.</span></p>
