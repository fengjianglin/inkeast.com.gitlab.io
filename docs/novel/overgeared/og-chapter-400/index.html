 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Japan, Tokyo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yoshimura exclaimed under a splendid chandelier in the press conference room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yoshimura will make Japan the most powerful Asian country!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Among the Japanese, Yoshimura was known as the ‘Defeated General.’&nbsp;</span><span style>His fight against the Korean Silver Knights Guild for Cork Island was a disaster.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he was defeated by Damian, who was considered a traitor from the right side extremists.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yoshimura had once been the 2nd ranked archer, but now his peak was over.&nbsp;</span><span style>Nevertheless, the Japanese still trusted Yoshimura.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yoshimura’s achievements in the past were so great that there were still a lot of expectations. Unfortunately, Japan didn’t have as many talented people as Yoshimura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It truly is Yoshimura!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reporters applauded at Yoshimura’s flamboyant appearance.&nbsp;</span><span style>But they didn’t ask any questions because there was no big interest.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reporters were interested in Damian and Katz who were sitting to Yoshimura’s left and right.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hum hum.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yoshimura felt ashamed and sat down.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reporters first questioned Katz, who hadn’t appeared in public for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Katz, I’m looking forward to seeing you after a long time. What have you been doing this whole time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bah, what a stupid question. Can’t you tell by looking at the list of rankers? I have been raising my level.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Katz was the son of one of the largest conglomerates in Japan.&nbsp;</span><span style>He grew up with everything since childhood, causing him to become arrogant.&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to that, he had a lot of anti-fans around the world. But the Japanese didn’t hate Katz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason was simple.&nbsp;</span><span style>Katz was one of Japan’s few hopes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The third epic hidden class.&nbsp;</span><span style>Blood Warrior Katz, he dreamt of becoming the 1st ranked user and only focused on hunting for the past year and a half.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That reminds me, you reached 19th on the unified rankings two weeks ago. At that time, all of the Japanese media outlets reported on Katz’ news.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You must be happy to be the first Japanese person ranked in the top 20.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reporters praised him, but Katz was offended.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was embarrassing.&nbsp;</span><span style>A year and a half ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He declared to the world that he would take the first position in six months, but he hadn’t even entered the single digits yet. This caused Katz to go crazy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>19th out of two billion users.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was certainly a huge achievement, but Katz’ pride was too high. Katz wasn’t satisfied at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What events do you plan to participate in this time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I haven’t decided yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What are you expecting Japan’s ranking to be?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How should I know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Based on Katz’ attitude, it seemed unreasonable to ask him any more questions.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reporters were satisfied that photos and videos were taken of Katz and turned their eyes to Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The pope is known to have a special relationship with Grid. Will you be able to face Grid as an enemy in the National Competition?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a question with hidden meanings.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian chose Grid over his country.&nbsp;</span><span style>Would he be able to face Grid as an enemy in the National Competition?&nbsp;</span><span style>As Yoshimura felt tense and Katz indifferent, Damian declared with a proud expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I know how to distinguish between the two. In the National Competition, Grid is naturally my enemy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The questions from the reporters poured out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What sort of events will you participate in?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Any combat related events are okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Does this mean you have confidence in battle?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Of course. I am really big.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What are you expecting Japan’s ranking to be?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hrmm.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian glanced sideways at Katz.&nbsp;</span><span style>"At least in the top 10?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Being in the top 10 out of 32 countries wasn’t low. It was likely to be the highest rank among the Asian countries.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian, who had responded coldly to requests for cooperation from the right-wing groups, was now speaking favorably about Japan, causing the reporters to feel excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were once again glad that a powerful presence like the pope was a Japanese.&nbsp;</span><span style>But some right-wing media groups questioned Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there still no play to build a Rebecca Temple in the territories that the Japanese Guilds rule over?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How about giving healers from the Rebecca Church as support for Japanese rankers?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Questions not related to the National Competition started to pour out.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian was silent.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t understand the psychology of the extreme right-wingers who wanted one-sided help just because he was Japanese.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Tsk, I am building a temple in Reidan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You really must be a Korean.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment that the right-wing reporters made the atmosphere uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think about this balance patch?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One young reporter asked a new question that reversed the mood.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian’s answer was enough to excite the Japanese people watching the press conference broadcast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s a patch to benefit me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian had strong defense, recovery skills, and phenomenal buff skills. What person could damage him with this patch?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"At least in the National Competition, I am invincible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Waaaaahhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Japan was overturned.&nbsp;</span><span style>The expectations of Japanese people towards Damian skyrocketed. The Internet speculated that perhaps Damian could win three gold medals in the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Damian poured cold water on them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Well, as long as I don’t go against Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why?&nbsp;</span><span style>Why did Damian praise Grid so much?&nbsp;</span><span style>The Japanese people didn’t know the details about the relationship between Grid and Damian, so they questioned it. More people wondered if Damian was actually a Korean.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Moscow, Russia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The press conference held for the participants of the 2nd National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Kraugel didn’t attend.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Seoul, South Korea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Zibal doesn’t know anything. If he meets God Grid in the same event, he will eventually have to give God Grid the gold medal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kang Daehan of the Korean Patriotic Association.&nbsp;</span><span style>His ID was Peak Sword in Satisfy and he was sitting in front of hundreds of reporters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And Hao? He doesn’t seem Chinese with how rude he is. Whether God Grid is nerfed or not, he is no match for God Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Excuse me... Kang Daehan, why didn’t Yura and Youngwoo attend this interview…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Also!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword didn’t answer the reporters’ questions.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was only 17 days until the National Competition. There was only one reason why Peak Sword attended this press conference despite being busy.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was to refute the words of rankers around the world.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword slammed his hand on the table and shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bondre, the French person who called Koreans uncivilized because we eat dog meat! The French eat foie gras, which is far more atrocious! A pot calling the kettle black. Bondre, I will make you feel ashamed, so be prepared! Understood? Hooray South Korea!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the moment when the National Competition’s press conference was turned into a Korean Patriotic Association meeting.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reporters thought it was silly, but also nice to have a character like Peak Sword in South Korea. He made them feel much better.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>As the whole world was paying attention to the 2nd National Competition, Grid was still wandering the labyrinth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have killed a cavalry knight.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[16,112,300 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Heok... Heok... Wow, I’m going crazy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had spent a fortnight of Satisfy time trapped in the labyrinth.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was hard to keep moving through the dark labyrinth without knowing how much was left until the exit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It might be different if the monsters are weak.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The monster that appeared in the labyrinth were between level 400~420.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It took Grid at least three minutes to hunt one. The monsters were strong. Allowing one attack would decrease his health by at least one-fourth. If he met three or more monsters at once, it was hard to deal with them without relying on his immortality passive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If it wasn’t for the immortal passive, I would’ve died and gone back to the 50th island.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just imagining it was horrible.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid gulped and used magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Magic Detection (Enhanced) Lv. 1 (93.1%)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>-The cooldown time is 4 minutes and 42 seconds-</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Sigh...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>After entering the labyrinth, the newly acquired skill was almost at level 2. It was catching up with the level of Magic Missile.&nbsp;</span><span style>It showed how many times Grid had used Magic Detection, and how long he had travelled.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yet he still couldn’t find the exit...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid sighed and sat down.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would try and use Meditation to recover his health, mana, and stamina while waiting for the cooldown time of Magic Detection to end.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it was difficult to use Meditation since he needed the utmost concentration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was able to succeed in Meditation after two minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Entering a meditative state.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Increases health and mana regeneration rate by 50%, and stamina regeneration by 30%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Skill cooldown time will be reduced by 10%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Not bad.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first, it took him more than five minutes to succeed in Meditation.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was fairly satisfied with the current speed of Meditation while thinking back to that time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The level of the God Hands’ Sword Mastery has gone up by quite a lot.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had certainly improved when compared to before he entered the Behen Archipelago.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was proud that he didn’t walk on this path in vain.&nbsp;</span><span style>However...</span></p>
 <p><span style>'When can I escape this labyrinth?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted to at least clear it before the National Competition began.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Come to think of it, he should be able to use Magic Detection again.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid got up and approached the three paths in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Magic Detection.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Mana poured out as Grid tried to find life in one of the paths.&nbsp;</span><span style>However.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Eh?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>No signs of life were detected anywhere.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the first time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What am I supposed to do?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to Braham’s advice, the closer he was to the exit of the labyrinth, the bigger the risk.&nbsp;</span><span style>But all three paths had no danger, so Grid couldn’t help feeling confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Should I ask Braham for help again?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He already relied on Assimilation when he faced a big crisis three days ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he waited for the cooldown of Assimilation to return, wouldn’t he need to wait at least six more days here?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was too big of a waste of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In the first place...’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt like he degenerated every time he depended on Braham.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yes, haven’t I been doing it all by myself so far?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could he overcome this situation?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid took a deep breath and focused his mind to the limits.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he discovered an answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Perhaps?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>So far, monsters were waiting on all the paths he took...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Maybe I have already passed the labyrinth?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was possible that the exit was right in front of him.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, he couldn’t go back after stepping on a new path, so he was terrified.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It will produce a much more valuable result than staying here.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If his thoughts were wrong and he fell into a new labyrinth, he would just need to find the way out again.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid raised all his courage and took the path in the middle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have succeeded in breaking through the labyrinth!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have acquired 2,150 challenger points for the mission success.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have entered Treasure Island (the 57th island)!!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Escape from Treasure Island in the next three minutes.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh...! Ohhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was extremely excited.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was strange not to get excited as the island full of gold and treasures appeared before him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Today’s lunch is seafood jajang!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment that Grid decided to summon Noe and Randy to get more treasures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Fog Island haunts this island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Treasure Island was covered with a thick fog.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid shed tears.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were deep tears of regret.</span></p>
