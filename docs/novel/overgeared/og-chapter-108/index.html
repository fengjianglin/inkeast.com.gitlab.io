 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo was in a hurry. He wanted to meet the alumni sooner now that he was no longer in debt. ‘Look at 23. I’m a success. You can’t ignore or abuse me anymore.’ That’s what he wanted to say. He wanted revenge for how they laughed at and ignored him over the years.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Buaaaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>23 drove on the roads, barely keeping to the speed limit.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this speed, he could reach the gathering place within 10 minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo felt like that was too long to show everyone his changed appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But... Why is the meeting place on the outskirts of the city? It can’t be reached with public transportation, so it is difficult for anyone without a car. Were they aiming at me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be very difficult for Youngwoo to go to the reunion place today if he hadn’t paid off the debt or bought a car.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t have any friends to borrow a car from, nor could he use public transportation. Therefore, he would’ve needed to take a taxi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Isn’t it too much to decide on a meeting place like this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo was confident that he was the victim they were aiming at, since they laughed at him for so long. As he focused on driving, he noticed something and slowed down.&nbsp;</span><span style>In front of him, a woman was opening her car bonnet and sending a signal for help.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The usual Youngwoo wouldn’t have helped anyone without any benefits. But now was an exception.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was curious because the woman asking for help was an obvious beauty, even from far away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Look at that style and ratio... It isn’t a joke.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman was wearing jeans, a white t-shirt and a black jacket over it. It was an outfit with no exposure. She also wore large sunglasses, so it was hard to grasp her appearance from afar.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he was convinced that she was a beauty with perfect proportions and white skin.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to check how pretty she was up close. This instinct couldn’t be suppressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I became negative towards women due to Ahyoung, but... As a human being, I can’t ignore a woman having trouble in the middle of the road.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo parked his car next to the woman asking for help. Then he was startled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t notice because of the woman, but the woman’s car was the S-model from Company C, which was four times more expensive than Youngwoo’s car.&nbsp;</span><span style>The model released by Company C for their 120th anniversary was very different from the 13 series because it targeted conglomerates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'A young woman with a car like this... Is she a second generation heir to a conglomerate, like in a drama?'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo cleared his throat and released his tension. Then he got out of the car and asked the woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Can I help you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She would’ve already contacted her insurance company. It wasn’t a normal car, so she would obviously care about it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo wanted to leave. But the woman was asking for help, so he couldn’t leave her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the woman took her sunglasses off,&nbsp;</span><span style>"I hope you will take me along with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo was surprised as he saw the woman’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was so amazed he thought his heart would stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Y-Yura?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The world famous rankers of Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to their frequent exposure in the media, there were few people playing Satisfy who didn’t know the names and faces of the rankers.&nbsp;</span><span style>They didn’t know the name of the US president, but they knew the names of Satisfy’s rankers. That was a well known joke among the users.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Among them, Yura was special.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was the only female in the top 10 of the unified rankings. She was regarded as the last hope for Koreans, who had been power gamers until half a century ago. She was also regarded as one of the best beauties in the east and west.&nbsp;</span><span style>She dominated not just domestic, but international CFs, and was ranked 3rd on the list of 100 most influential people in the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why did he come across a woman like that here?&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo was very confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Does this make sense? No matter how small South Korea is, how can a coincidence like this happen?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, Youngwoo had a link with Yura. No, it was more of a bad relationship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After becoming Pagma's Descendant, he had a conflict with Yura during Doran’s quest. He failed the quest due to Yura’s interference and he wrote bad comments about her on the Internet to resolve his grudge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Perhaps...’&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo assumed the worst.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘She commissioned cyber forensics to track me down and get revenge?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was possible considering Yura’s wealth and authority.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No, that can’t be. This isn’t a manhwa... It’s a mere coincidence.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura drove in a wedge while Youngwoo was trying to calm down,&nbsp;</span><span style>“It is nice to see you, Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Cough..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>She knew his identity? It truly wasn’t a coincidence that she appeared before Youngwoo!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Revenge! She came to get revenge!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo’s confusion and anxiety reached the peak.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had experienced Blood Witch Yura’s cruelty already. He didn’t know what to expect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'S-Should I drive away?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo shook while Yura climbed into his passenger seat without permission.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You can drive me up to your destination. Please let me ride in your car. I have something to say.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo couldn’t refuse.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Why is Shin Youngwoo so late?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>During high school, Lee Junho had cursed and assaulted his classmates. He was a terrible person. There wasn’t one person who hadn’t needed to pay money to Lee Junho.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It was hard for even the seniors and teachers to go against him. He also used violence against his few friends, Sim Kiwan and Choi Chansung.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His violent streak didn’t improve after graduating from high school and going to the army and university. Before he knew it, he was 27 years old and still couldn’t adapt to society, constantly changing jobs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lee Junho worked in a PC room, convenience store, gas station and so on, until one day he suddenly realized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I am nothing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he was a student, everything was okay when he fought. Regardless of their gender, everyone was under his feet. He could do what he wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the situation was different when he entered society.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those who studied hard during high school could get a suitable job, but there was no company that would accept Lee Junho, who knew nothing but fighting. Whenever he fought, he was dragged to the police station and forced to pay a settlement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>As it turned out, he wasn’t the best in fighting either. He went to the gym to learn martial arts, but there were countless people present.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lee Junho started to become anxious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t get a job or do anything well, so would he be able to marry anyone? He couldn’t even afford to worry about his marriage funds, since he might starve to death in a few years. If he managed to survive, he would struggle to cope with an old and lonely life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lee Junho kept drinking as he imagined the worst situation. He couldn’t sleep without the alcohol.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then two years ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was able to shake off all his worries once he met Shin Youngwoo at the reunion.&nbsp;</span><span style>For the first time in a long time, he saw someone below him.&nbsp;</span><span style>At least Lee Junho wasn’t in debt. But Shin Youngwoo had a large debt and was obsessed with games.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Junho could feel assured when looking at Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Aren’t I at least better than him?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It really was like magic.&nbsp;</span><span style>Since he met Youngwoo, Junho was able to fall asleep without drinking. No matter how terrible his life was, he could bear it at the thought of Youngwoo having it worse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>And now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Junho lived a life that was almost the same as two years ago. He was still wandering around jobs.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was already in his late 20s. Soon he would be 30 years old.&nbsp;</span><span style>Instead of saving money, he still couldn’t find proper work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t resist cursing or assaulting a customer when working in a convenience store or at a PC room counter. Then he needed to pay the settlements.&nbsp;</span><span style>His pride was badly hurt when working at a gas station. He was covered in oil, unlike his peers. In addition, he was irritated whenever he saw young men or women in foreign cars.&nbsp;</span><span style>Labor was worse. People who did labor work were middle-aged losers who weren’t expecting much from their life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>As such, Junho was trying to change the situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, he was aware that it was hard, so he got caught up in anxiety and started to rely on alcohol again.&nbsp;</span><span style>He needed a prescription.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had to meet Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would be able to laugh at Youngwoo with his fellow high school classmates and forget his worries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other alumni were in a similar position.&nbsp;</span><span style>Junho might be in the worst situation, but they were all uneasy about their futures. They wanted to meet Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reunion location of the Heroes High School 45th graduation class.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lee Junho, the secretary of the Alumni Association, was nervous when Youngwoo didn’t show up on time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, Kim Ahyoung. Are you sure Youngwoo is coming?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ahyoung ridiculed him,&nbsp;</span><span style>"I’m not sure. I don’t know if he can come because you decided on this meeting place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a garden restaurant outside the city.&nbsp;</span><span style>A person without their own car would have to take a taxi to get here. It was doubtful if the debt-ridden Youngwoo could afford the taxi fee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lee Junho, who deliberately selected this meeting place, started to feel belated regret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That pathetic guy... He can’t even afford a taxi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow! Look over there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The alumni started to make a fuss as they looked out the window.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lee Junho and Kim Ahyoung also looked out the window.&nbsp;</span><span style>They witnessed a black vehicle enter the parking lot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"13 series...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A limited edition car worth 800 million won!&nbsp;</span><span style>Lee Junho had seen a lot of foreign cars while working at the gas station, but he never saw a car of this degree.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Shit! There are bastards like this everywhere I go!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lee Junho shook his head at the thought that the 13 series would be a 2nd generation conglomerate’s car, while Kim Ahyoung had hearts in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘My life will be set if I can marry a guy with a car like that. When can I date a guy like that?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the car stopped at one side of the parking lot.&nbsp;</span><span style>Everyone was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style>The person who descended from the driver’s seat was Shin Youngwoo!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lee Junho stood up and cried out.&nbsp;</span><span style>How did Shin Youngwoo, a debt ridden game loser, come in such a luxury car?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No way!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that he stole it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lee Junho and all the alumni thought so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Ahyoung thought differently.&nbsp;</span><span style>'He paid off his debt and got a job... It wasn’t a lie? But how good is his job that he can afford a car like that?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ahyoung's brain was spinning fast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Anyway, it is good. Youngwoo likes me... He doesn’t have any dating experience, so it’ll be easy to catch him, then my life will be set. Okay, I will make him my man.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a woman came down from the passenger seat.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ahyoung became desperate the moment she saw the woman’s beauty.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Junho and the other alumni had to spit out their water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Pfft!!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"W-What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why were they so shocked? It was due to the identity of the woman in the passenger seat.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her beauty could be recognized even at a distance. There was a halo around her. That was a suitable saying to describe her beauty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“H-How did this happen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one could understand this situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>As everyone was confused, Yura leaned up and kissed Youngwoo. After a while, a big limousine appeared and took Yura away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"T-This scene...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the eyes of others, it looked like Yura left the car after enjoying a date with Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style>The imagination of Youngwoo’s fellow alumni ran wild.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Did Youngwoo manage to seduce Yura? Did Yura pay off his debt and buy that car for him?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How did he come into contact with a woman like Yura? The worlds they live in are completely different, so there is no place where they could meet. No, maybe... Is Youngwoo actually the young master of a rich house? Is Youngwoo just pretending to be a normal high school and university student with a debt?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Maybe... Youngwoo could form a relationship with Yura because of Satisfy...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yes. Youngwoo’s time playing Satisfy wasn’t in vain. He met Yura in Satisfy, their relationship developed to lovers and this moved to reality...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Damn! If I unconditionally played Satisfy instead of working, could I be like Youngwoo?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo finally entered the restaurant.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo already knew that the alumni in the restaurant had witnessed the scene outside, so he waved leisurely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Have you been well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was Youngwoo?&nbsp;</span><span style>He looked and acted completely different from before.&nbsp;</span><span style>No one was able to talk to Youngwoo, who sat on the side. They just looked at him. T</span><span style>hen Youngwoo, holding a cup of wine in his hand, extended another cup to Lee Junho.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hasn’t it been a while? Have a cup.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh? Y-Yes. Yes...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lee Junho was dumbfounded.&nbsp;</span><span style>Shin Youngwoo had shrunk back from him since their school days, now he was asking them to drink together!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I didn’t want to see him for this...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anger boiled inside Junho’s heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo emptied his glass and said to Junho.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Come on, have a drink. But how are you doing these days? You still haven’t fixed your habit of biting your nails? You’re getting older, so you should stop it. Isn't that right?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lee Junho snapped and got up from his seat. Then he grabbed Youngwoo and snarled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You bastard! I don’t know what happened but don’t pretend to be elite! I will kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, Youngwoo would be angry and afraid. But now he was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was a man. In particular, for adult men, abilities became power and confidence. Those who had the ability wouldn’t shrink back easily in any situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you so mad? Look back at all the words and actions you’ve made against me. Do you have any idea how angry I was?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Junho reflexively shrunk back from the look in Youngwoo’s eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because the appearance of a man flashed through his mind.&nbsp;</span><span style>The psychopath in the skull helmet who beat him up in Kesan Canyon! The look in Youngwoo’s eyes was like the psychopath who recently shattered the Giant Guild in Winston.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is this possible? That bastard is him?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Junho noticed Youngwoo’s identity and backed away.&nbsp;</span><span style>Junho, the madman who couldn’t be controlled, retreated like a dog.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was hard to believe.&nbsp;</span><span style>To the alumni, Youngwoo felt like a different person than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Youngwoo started laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This wine tastes good. What are you doing? Aren’t you drinking?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo had suffered many difficulties over the years. The memory of being bullied by the alumni was his biggest trauma.&nbsp;</span><span style>But on this day, he was able to perfectly overcome that trauma, resulting in a psychologically more stable and mature Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This growth was sure to be a great help to him when playing Satisfy in the future.</span></p>

 <p><span style>'Did this help him?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A little while ago, Yura had descended from the car and narrowed the distance to Youngwoo to get rid of a piece of dust in his hair.&nbsp;</span><span style>The angle from the restaurant made it seem like a kiss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura smiled as she remembered the help she received from Shin Youngwoo at the Yatan Temple in the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘My debt has been paid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura had accomplished various feats with her own power.&nbsp;</span><span style>She wanted to get rid of the weak memory of receiving help from another.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thus, she kept paying attention to Grid and after a recent investigation, she determined that she could pay off the debt in this form.</span></p>
