 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style> "Kuk... I didn’t think someone like this would be here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas took a potion to restore his health and immediately changed his system setting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whisper unblock. Guild chat unblock.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then...</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Hey you! You will die if you don’t find Regas today!}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{T-Take it easy, Master.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Yes, excitement isn’t good for your skin. Isn’t Master a woman as well?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Shut up... All of you, shut up! If you have time to chat, look for that bastard Regas!}</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guild chat window was filled with chaos.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka was reacting worse than Regas expected, so he hesitated for a moment before typing on the keyboard,</span></p>
 <p><span style>{The slope of Rolf Mountain. Please send support.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>The chaotic chat window became more frenzied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Regas!}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Hey, Regas! What have you been doing all day? Why did you block the chat? Answer me!}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{You don’t know how we have been tortured because of you!}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Rolf Mountain...? I will visit you soon. ^^}</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwang!</span></i> <i><span style>Kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Regas avoided the black magic that the followers were shooting from all directions, elbowed the face of the closest believer, and typed in the chat again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Come prepared for battle. Malacus has appeared.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>The chat window got crazy once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Malacus? The Sixth Servant?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Eh? Why is he on Rolf Mountain? Shouldn’t he be with the other Yatan bastards?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{What... Where have you been wandering around? ㅡㅡ}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Why is Malacus there?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Isn’t he a monster that is level 310?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{ㅡㅡ;;}</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was amazed by the presence of Malacus, while Jishuka was obsessed with Khan’s disciple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Hey! Regas! Are you still with the person called Grid?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{ㅇ ㅇ}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Grab Grid tightly and don’t let him go! He is Khan’s disciple that we are looking for!}</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Regas frowned as he saw Jishuka’s words.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Grid is a blacksmith? No way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas exclaimed while kicking two Yatan followers at the same time. After counterattacking, he quickly hid behind a tree and entered the chat again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{That isn’t possible?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{It must be -_-^ I heard it from a witness. Grid is definitely Khan’s disciple.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{That eyewitness must be mistaken or gave you a false report.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>After typing briefly, Regas blocked the chat again to focus on the battle and turned to Grid. Grid was holding a large sword that was more than 3m long and was facing Malacus alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There is no way he can be a blacksmith. The guild master... she must be mistaken.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the meantime, Grid...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is going on?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Malacus expressed great interest in Grid since he first appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I am impressed that you can endure the pressure of my magic power.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Malacus judged that Grid, who avoided all his status effects, wasn’t a regular person.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Then you... are you like Yura? An extraordinary person among travelers?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wanted to solve it with dialogue as much as possible.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Not really... well, I didn’t come here to meet you. So can I go my own way?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t allow that.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please have mercy just once. Hehe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One of the most insignificant words in the world is mercy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Malacus was one of the most brutal religious figures in Satisfy. It was foolish trying to communicate with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Che, whatever.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid opened his inventory. Then he equipped armor without being conscious of Regas at all. After that, he pulled out Dainsleif, which had been strengthened to +5.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[+5 Dainsleif (Reproduction)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 500/500 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 549~772 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Speed: -8%</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Additional damage equal to 10% of the target’s current defense will be dealt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The greater the number of enemies, the greater the damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The skill ‘Golden Flash’ has been generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A work created by Albatino, the first human to receive the nickname of ‘craftsman before Pagma’s era. He attempted the reproduce the mythical weapon, Dainsleif.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is far lacking compared to the original Dainsleif, but he succeeded in restoring some of its features, making it a masterpiece on its own.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was acclaimed as a ‘masterpiece of human history’ by the founder of the Eternal Kingdom and the king of the north, Loran.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The legendary blacksmith Pagma is said to have received great inspiration from Albatino’s work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>User Restriction: Level 250 or higher. More than 1,800 strength. Advanced Sword Mastery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 1,580</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A great sword. But can it reach my body?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Malacus wasn’t a monster but a human. He didn’t have a special appearance.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was just an ordinary man in his 30s, wearing a black mask and a long cloak covering his body.&nbsp;</span><span style>He seemed less scary than the terrible monsters Grid faced in Kesan Canyon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You will see soon! Blacksmith's Rage! Quick Movements! Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Link!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the mural, Pagma held Dainsleif in one hand and wielded it. However, it was impossible for Grid to wield Dainsleif with one hand with his current strength.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Thus, he held Dainsleif with both hands and didn’t look as dazzling.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Buuuong.</span></i> <i><span style>Buuuong.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style> Dainsleif moved with a speed that was disproportionate to its huge size. Then he slashed at Malacus’ body.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>But just before Dainsleif hit Malacus’ body, a black shield appeared, blocking the sword in its path.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the attack was blocked, Grid hurriedly placed Dainsleif back in his inventory and then pulled out the +8 Ideal Dagger.&nbsp;</span><span style>He consumed 490 mana after using Blacksmith’s Rage, Quick Movements and activating Pagma’s Swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid used his remaining 277 mana to activate one of Ideal Dagger’s integrated skills.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wind Blast!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Wind Blast exploded against Malacus’ body. But it couldn’t touch Malacus. Just before the winds touched Malacus’ body, a black shield emerged at the point of collision and blocked all winds.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gulp gulp.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid pulled out a mana potion and drank it before activating Wind of Justice.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Wind of Justice was much more powerful than Wind Blast.&nbsp;</span><span style>But even Wind of Justice collapsed in front of a shield and didn’t reach Malacus’ body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is this fraudulent defense skill? How much damage can it prevent?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Malacus pulled out a hand that was hidden in the cloak and aimed at Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Your weakness won’t be able to break this. Die. Divine Punishme...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Malacus paused in the middle of the spell he was casting and then stepped back from Grid because Grid had used Restraint.&nbsp;</span><span style>Restraint overwhelmed everything except for the undead, and the overwhelmed opponents were unable to approach Grid for three seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid ran as far from Malacus as possible and shouted,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Regas! Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Regas was still attacking the followers without any thought of escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Regas!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas looked at the desperately rushing Grid and declared,&nbsp;</span><span style>“I don’t run away. I will fight. When can I ever meet such a strong opponent again? I want to fight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... You are really crazy. Aren’t you afraid of dropping items and experience upon death?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was reluctant to leave Regas and run away alone. He wanted Regas’ help finding the Divine Shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'But I can’t die in the process. If I die and drop items...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of Grid’s currently equipped items were expensive. He would feel like committing suicide if he dropped one of them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thus, Grid decided to escape by himself.&nbsp;</span><span style>But at that moment, a sound was heard.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Swaeek!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>An object shot out from the forest.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an arrow.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Malacus was still somewhat constrained by the influence of Restraint, so he couldn’t respond to the arrow that flew without notice and struck his shoulder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Then a beauty appeared from the direction that the arrow came from. It was Jishuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you don’t want to be killed by the arrows like that monster, you should stay in a corner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka warned Grid while staring sharply at Malacus. Then she pulled back her bowstring.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka, currently ranked 19th in the unified rankings, was a woman who had long been called an expert archer. The arrow she shot seemed like it would touch Grid’s ears, but it swiftly flashed passed and hit Malacus’ head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But at some point, Malacus escaped from the influence of Restraint and created a black shield.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ting!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The arrow was bounced back.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka didn’t shake at the sight. She fired five arrows in rapid succession.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Syu syu syu syu syuk!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ting ting ting ting ting!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All five arrows aimed at the weak parts of the body but were blocked by the shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The speed of casting is really fast?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka admired while Malacus smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Heh, your fragile arrows can’t touch my body...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Malacus couldn’t finish speaking.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because Regas, who killed the 30 Yatan followers, approached his side and punched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Penetration."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Keok....!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Malacus bent in a strange direction after Regas’ fist hit his side. The whites of his eyes were revealed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka loaded a new arrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That isn’t the real one. This is real.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The arrow flew along the flow of the wind without any sound and struck Malacus’ heart.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid was familiar with this arrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh? The Special Jaffa Arrow? There are still some left?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka heard Grid’s words and cocked her head.&nbsp;</span><span style>“How do you know that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was JIshuka and Regas’ power sufficient to knock down the mighty Malacus? If so, maybe he didn’t have to drop his items? Grid was so excited that he spoke without thinking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh, I made it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Regas shrieked.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Kuaaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“……!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka and Grid hurriedly turned their heads. They discovered five black spears piercing Regas’ body.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dark magic was around the wound and Malacus, who had recovered quickly, grabbed Reggas’ head and declared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is still useless. You will all die by my hands!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are we late?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, Regas! You’re still alive?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>15 members of the Tzedakah Guild emerged, causing even Malacus to flinch for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How is a group like this...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka gave a smile that was brimming with confidence and stated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Start the hunt.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The average level of the Tzedakah Guild was above 200. Many of them were first in their class rankings and within the top 100 unified rankings. There was also a variable called Grid. Even if the opponent was one of the Eight Servants, it wasn’t a power that could be underestimated.</span></p>
