 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro allowed Grid to deal a deadly attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He realized it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘My use of the farming equipment is wrong!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had already mastered swordsmanship. Therefore, he used it as the base for his farming techniques.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was following its principles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is an obvious mistake!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Farming and swordsmanship were completely different.&nbsp;</span><span style>Wasn’t farming equipment a tool for life, while a sword was a tool for death?&nbsp;</span><span style>The farming equipment could be enhanced by the sword techniques, but they were fundamentally different.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was right to change his approach.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Discard swordsmanship!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no reason to use swordsmanship with farming techniques.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was poison from the beginning, since he should use swordsmanship with a sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro’s awareness drastically changed.&nbsp;</span><span style>He seemed to be another person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hands gripping the farming equipment loosened, and he now had a free and relaxed attitude. He stood like a farmer.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Flash!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro’s body was surrounded by light.&nbsp;</span><span style>A quest window appeared in front of the confused Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Lord’s Confidence]</span></p>
 <p><span style>★ Hidden Quest ★</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro has gained new enlightenment and awakened as a true farmer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He has completely forsaken the sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, he wants to be acknowledged by you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Spar with Piaro!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Please experience Piaro’s skills and acknowledge him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Depending on the results, Piaro will grow even more!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Conditions: Win or lose in a spar with Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Defeat in a spar with Piaro: Piaro will gain great pride as a farmer. Piaro’s stats and skills will significantly rise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Victory in a spar with Piaro: Piaro will feel skeptical and once again walk on the path of the sword again. The stats that rose as a result of Piaro becoming a legend will be destroyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Hidden Quest ‘Lord’s Confidence’ will proceed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Now you and Piaro have entered sparring mode.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The spar will continue until the health of one person reaches the minimum.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You won’t die in sparring mode.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord’s Confidence.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was a type of bonus quest.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was the lord, so being defeated by Piaro would raise Piaro’s morale and allow him to grow.&nbsp;</span><span style>It would be a huge benefit and Piaro would be able to become even stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Grid was a conventional lord, he would be happy and dancing while thanking the heavens.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid was hoping that Piaro would become a sword saint.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was paying attention to the result of his victory, not his defeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Walk the path of the sword again?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was confusing.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would either make Piaro definitely stronger as a farmer, or make him walk the path of the sword again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If he walks the path of the sword, he can develop into a sword saint.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, he couldn’t be certain of this.&nbsp;</span><span style>No matter how great Piaro was, it wasn’t certain that he would become a sword saint.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was also disconcerting that Piaro’s current abilities would fall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is it right to lose?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, no.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kkuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid strongly grasped Iyarugt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will do my best.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lose on purpose?&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro wouldn’t want such a method.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If you want to prove the value of a farmer, beat me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he couldn’t beat Grid, take up the sword again.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pioneer your path with your own strength!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid jumped forward at that thought.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was still 30 seconds left of Quick Movements.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid meant to win during that time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blacksmith’s Rage!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Attack power will increase by 25% and attack speed will increase by 40%.] This effect will last for 35 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s strength reached the peak.&nbsp;</span><span style>He approached Piaro and excitedly attacked him.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wasn’t just fast. The trajectory was the best because he attacked along the path that Iyarugt was telling him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Piaro avoided it.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an unexpected move.&nbsp;</span><span style>He bent over and squatted down?</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This guy’s talent suddenly became low!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iyarugt was disappointed.&nbsp;</span><span style>It meant he didn’t understand Piaro’s intention, and was proof that Piaro was far beyond Iyarugt.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro squatted and hit the ground hard with the hand plow.&nbsp;</span><span style>Water shot up in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The problem was that the gushing water interrupted his field of view.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was confused and in this gap, Piaro quickly sprinkled seeds all over the land.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the same time, something incredible happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The whole area was quickly transformed into a field.&nbsp;</span><span style>Numerous wheat tinged with gold grew around Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is nonsense!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wheat field just before harvest was created in just an instant?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was just as spectacular as the magic that Braham showed. No, in a sense, it was more amazing.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro started doing PR to the disbelieving Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Imagine it. What if a legendary farmer is marching with an army and circumstances lead to a food shortage? I can immediately clear a field and feed the soldiers!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Heok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was amazing to hear.&nbsp;</span><span style>There would be no food shortages with an army led by Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was about to be persuaded when he asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What if there is no water?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Use the water from nearby rivers or have magicians summon water.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What if there are no rivers or magicians?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...It will rain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If it doesn’t rain?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Free Farming 5th Style, Harvest!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The time for questions was over.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this moment, Piaro gained a new enlightenment again and wielded the sickle.&nbsp;</span><span style>A sharp qi was projected and the wheat was cut.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid immediately bowed to avoid it and cried out.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were thousands, tens of thousands of wheat scattered everywhere. It was a dizzying sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is too unnecessary!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It happened when Grid was nervously brushing away the wheat in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Pepepepeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The many wheat exploded without notice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid screamed as the entire field was engulfed in an explosion.&nbsp;</span><span style>If it hadn’t been for the God Hand covering him, Grid would’ve suffered so much damage it wouldn’t be strange for his health to fall to the minimum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk...! Ugh! Cough! Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The harvested wheat exploded?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How is there such a process in farming!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid shouted as he was covered with scorched flour.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro bluntly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is polishing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What polishing!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Polishing referred to the process of removing the surface of the grain to make it clean and white, not turning it into ashes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was about to reply when he suddenly realized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I lost my composure.&nbsp;</span><span style>I was too shaken because of the wheat field.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid barely managed to focus his mind.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to gain the momentum again, he decided to use Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Transcended Link.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dozens of dark energy blades overpowered Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>It contained a fierce momentum worthy of one of the best skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t stay still either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He moved forward, planning to attack when Piaro was distracted defending against the energy blades.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an excellent plan. But the opponent was too strong.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro used Natural State and overwhelmed Grid’s speed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Teteteteng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The flail flew forward.&nbsp;</span><span style>Like a feather duster, it moved without hesitation towards Grid. It scattered something with every move, reminiscent of dust.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh! Kkuk! Keok! Kek!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This dust. Grid kept moaning. His health gauge fell in an instant.&nbsp;</span><span style>Iyarugt was astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[I can’t read the trajectory!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Useless!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, he wasn’t in a position to blame others.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid felt helpless.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro was really strong.&nbsp;</span><span style>He used all types of items and skills to win, but he couldn’t narrow the gap.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yes, it felt like he was facing a wall that couldn’t be overcome.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Grid didn’t give up.&nbsp;</span><span style>He still had a trump card remaining!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Piaro...! I’m not backing down yet!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What were the God Hands doing now while Grid was being beaten by the flail? Why didn’t they come and protect their master?&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro saw Grid’s confident face and suddenly found the four hands hammering at an anvil behind Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is going on?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro was alert.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have succeeded in combining Failure and Grid’s Greatsword!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style>The God Hands flew quickly and handed the greatsword to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The combination of Grid’s Greatsword and Failure was truly transcendent.&nbsp;</span><span style>This wasn’t the end.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the center of the merged greatsword, the Darkness Rune was installed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then an explosion demonic energy was emitted from the greatsword, making it a perfect match with the blackened Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it didn’t work against Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>So what if he had the strongest weapon in hand?&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t even swing it!&nbsp;</span><span style>The duration of Quick Movements was over, so Grid could overcome Piaro’s speed in the Natural State. He allowed attacks and in the end, he was forced to admit it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You as a farmer...! Farmer! Ugh! I will recognize your path as a farmer!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your health has fallen to a minimum, so sparring mode is finished!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The hidden quest ‘Lord’s Confidence’ has been completed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Piaro’s stats and skills will significantly rise.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a result of today, Piaro was able to be reborn as a true legend.&nbsp;</span><span style>His level was still low compared to the previous legends, but all other aspects were comparable.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Grid...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn! I’m also a legend, but why am I in this shape?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The great demons, Braham, Marie Rose and now Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were too many mountains to overcome.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was eager to become stronger.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t want to feel this helpless again, or experience failure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In order to become stronger.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Increasing his control and agility was a top priority.&nbsp;</span><span style>The means that could help both grow at the same time was naturally hunting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Level up!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But before that, there was something Grid had to do.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was to create a set of farming equipment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As the best weapons (?) used by his top subordinate, Grid devoted a few days to making it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to that, even Piaro was equipped with the power of items. In short, a monstrous scam was born.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was barely satisfied with his work and headed towards the vampire cities.&nbsp;</span><span style>He joined the Pavranium Expedition and hunted until the experience and item acquisition buff was over.&nbsp;</span><span style>By the time he reached level 305 and returned, there was less than a month left before Irene gave birth.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Epilogue</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris and the Five Captains were bewildered as they plowed the fields.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because Piaro had six sheaths hanging at his waist. He normally wore farming equipment there, so why were there sheaths?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No, is he holding a knife?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There are six of them...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Were they going crazy?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro cleared his throat as he approached Chris and the Five Captains. Then he proudly straightened and pulled out the knife from the sheath... No, it was farming equipment.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>The luxurious sheaths at Piaro’s waist were actually for farming equipment.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the work that Grid had carefully made for Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris was filled with a strong desire to possess them. He also wanted to have such nice storage places for farming equipment.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris was third on the unified rankings.</span></p>
