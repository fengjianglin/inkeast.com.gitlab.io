 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Khan welcomed me as I returned from Kesan Canyon.&nbsp;</span><span style>"You defeated the ghastly monsters in Kesan Canyon! You’re truly amazing! How about it? Did you learn Pagma’s Swordsmanship properly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Of course."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Can you give me the chance to appreciate the great swordsmanship that thrilled my ancestor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay. It is narrow here, so let’s go to the yard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was Khan’s smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style>I picked up the Ideal Dagger in a place where there was a lot of firewood. Then I activated Pagma’s Swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Wave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I danced, scattering blue light in every direction. Khan was impressed by the spectacular sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohhhh! Amazing! It is so beautiful and intense!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"In fact, there are four other sword techniques, but it has to end here today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why? I want to watch the rest of the sword dance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I wanted to show off to Khan. But I currently only had 630 mana!&nbsp;</span><span style>After activating Pagma’s Swordsmanship and using Wave, I only had 260 mana left. I didn’t have any mana for another technique.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, I had to be honest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don’t have enough mana to use it continuously. I can drink mana potions, but it’s a waste of money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah, I see. Unfortunately, it can’t be helped. Now follow me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan dragged me into the smithy. Then he picked up Dainsleif on the second floor and handed it to me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the promised reward. You are Pagma's Descendant, so I believe you can understand and use Dainsleif more than anyone else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Dainsleif (Reproduction) has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Quest success!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Dainsleif (Reproduction)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 500/500 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 451~635 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Speed: -8%</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Additional damage equal to 10% of the target’s current defense will be dealt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The greater the number of enemies, the greater the damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The skill ‘Golden Flash’ has been generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A work created by Albatino, the first human to receive the nickname of ‘craftsman before Pagma’s era. He attempted the reproduce the mythical weapon, Dainsleif.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is far lacking compared to the original Dainsleif, but he succeeded in restoring some of its features, making it a masterpiece on its own.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was acclaimed as a ‘masterpiece of human history’ by the founder of the Eternal Kingdom and king of the north, Loran.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The legendary blacksmith Pagma is said to have received great inspiration from Albatino’s work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>User Restriction: Level 250 or higher. More than 1,800 strength. Advanced Sword Mastery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 1,580&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The conditions of use were fairly high, but it was a weapon that was above the Sword of Self-transcendence when just looking at the function.&nbsp;</span><span style>I believed that Dainsleif was currently one of the top weapons that existed in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Only top rankers would have a weapon like this in their hands.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>I really liked Dainsleif. First of all, it was a greatsword. Secondly, the performance was good. Finally, I liked the appearance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dainsleif was around 3m and 20cm in length. Its appearance was overwhelming.&nbsp;</span><span style>The blade made of black iron expressed elegance and strength at the same time. While the silver handle made of mithril wasn’t much to boast of, it made a subtle and elegant combination of black and silver.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If I carried this on my back, it was clear that everyone would look at me with envy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I enhance it, won’t it generate an amazing effect?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was thrilled and vigorously shouted.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Okay! Next is Valhalla!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan had been waiting for someone who could use and appreciate the value of Dainsleif and Valhalla.&nbsp;</span><span style>And that person was none other than me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Khan! What next? How do I obtain Valhalla?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan laughed and patted my shoulder.&nbsp;</span><span style>"First of all, let me rest. If I get rid of it too quickly, I’m afraid my medical conditions will act up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Based on Khan’s reaction, it seems I didn’t meet the conditions for the second class quest yet.&nbsp;</span><span style>I nodded towards Khan, believing that someday the time would come.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The Eighth Servant appeared!&nbsp;</span><span style>All users belonging to the Yatan Church gained 20% more experience for a certain period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>As a result, the number of new users who signed up for the Yatan Church increased dramatically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, everything resulted in the Yatan Church’s growth.&nbsp;</span><span style>The world showed a great interest in how the growth of the Yatan Church, the most impure and wicked among all forces in Satisfy, would affect the future of Satisfy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of them had negative interpretations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It will be difficult to maintain Satisfy’s security if the Yatan Church keeps growing. Even now, there are cities where the number of NPC victims are increasing exponentially and the population is sharply decreasing. There are countless villages that disappeared altogether. The Alliance must be victorious in battle against the Yatan Church.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were also people guarded against Yura’s growth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Eighth Servant is definitely Yura. As a high ranking member of the Yatan Church, she will enjoy tremendous success as the Yatan Church becomes stronger. It is something that regular users can’t even imagine! Then the confrontation between rankers will become a one-sided game!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Well, there were many other concerns.&nbsp;</span><span style>But I had no interest in such things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m busy with my own life. It’s painful that Yura is eating all the good things alone, but wasn’t it originally like that? It’s funny to be jealous now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three days had passed since I returned from Kesan Canyon.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the meantime, I just devoted myself to making items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But in those three days, I only made three normal and one rare rated item...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The production rate is really dirty. This is why it’s better to make money by hunting. When will I earn the money to pay off the debt? Sigh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I wanted to rush towards the northern snowfields right away. I would be able to raise my level by hunting the frostlight orcs while collecting the sylphid scales at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It would be nice to collect 20 sylphis scales and make the Hooded Zip Up... I can also raise my experience by leveling up.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the sylphid scales had a terrible drop rate.&nbsp;</span><span style>I needed to repay the interest on the debt in five days of real time, so it was difficult to expect anything with the low drop probability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Let’s concentrate on making items for five days. I need stable profit to pay off the interest. If I don’t pay off the interest, a foreclosure notice might arrive.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you Mr. Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While I was sighing over my life, two soldiers arrived at the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was in a bad mood so I spoke bluntly, and they immediately replied.&nbsp;</span><span style>“The administrator is urgently searching for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed to be a continuation of the Business with the Administrator quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'What do I need to make this time?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn't it possible to earn a large amount of money this time?&nbsp;</span><span style>I headed towards the castle with expectant thoughts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The administrator’s office.&nbsp;</span><span style>Once I entered, the administrator handed me a scroll like he had been waiting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is urgent. Would you be able to produce an item with this production method?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>I opened the scroll.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[’Divine Shield’ Production Method]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prerequisite: Advanced Blacksmith Mastery Level 3 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Divine Shield: A shield that contains the power of Rebecca, the goddess of light. Due to its strength against dark magic, all followers of demons and the Yatan Church will suffer when facing this shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>User Restriction: Level 190 or higher.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was being given this precious production method?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The administrator asked me cautiously.&nbsp;</span><span style>"You don’t have the ability to understand and make this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I shook my head.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Nope, I can understand and learn it easily.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh! If so, please learn it and make this shield!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a chance to learn how to make a level 190 item for free. There was no reason for me to refuse. But there was a separate matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I can make the shield according to the production method, but I don’t have the divine power to imprint on the shield.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An item containing divine power couldn’t be completed with a blacksmith alone. I needed help from a priest or magician.&nbsp;</span><span style>It seemed the administrator also knew this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't worry. I already have a priest prepared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The administrator looked to one side. I looked over and saw a young man in a white garment, with the symbol of Goddess Rebecca on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'What, who is this person?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite being in the same room, I hadn’t been able to detect him at all.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was a strange person who didn’t give off any presence, even when I was facing him now.&nbsp;</span><span style>I felt an instinctive discomfort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The priest ignored my vigilance and greeted me.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I am Cassus. This body serves Rebecca, the goddess of light. Please look after me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The name above Cassus’ head was green. In other words, he was an NPC.&nbsp;</span><span style>I answered warily.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Ah, yes. Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then a quest information rose up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Business with the Administrator (2)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level of difficulty: AA</span></p>
 <p><span style>Winston is defenseless after consecutive losses and great damage to the troops.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Administrator Valdi needs the Divine Shield to prepare for the Yatan Church’s counterattack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You must work with Cassus, a priest who serves Goddess Rebecca, to complete the Divine Shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Conditions: A Divine Shield with a minimum of an epic rating delivered within two days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Acceptance Reward: Learn how to make the Divine Shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Rewards: Depends on the level of the item delivered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Failure: The business deal with the administrator is cancelled and the quest will be destroyed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Would you like to accept the quest?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no reason to refuse. No, I was looking forward to the quest.&nbsp;</span><span style>But there was one thing I had to consider.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is the Yatan Church likely to invade Winston?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In order for the enemy to advance here, they must go through Kinban Fortress. And Kinban Fortress holds the elite army of the north. So the possibility of enemy forces invading Winston is very slim. But we can’t rule out the possibility that a small number will sneak in here to attack. The Divine Shield is necessary to go against them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm... I see. I hope my strength will be a help.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The quest has been accepted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have acquired the method to make the Divine Shield.]</span></p>
