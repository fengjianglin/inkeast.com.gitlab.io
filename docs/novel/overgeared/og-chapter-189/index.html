 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style> "This is the end."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi was an ordinary orator until level 127, so he invested his stat points in both intelligence and persuasion. Since getting a second class at level 127, he was now level 236 and he invested his stats primarily into strength, stamina and agility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was to take advantage of the Apostle of Justice’s Partner class.&nbsp;</span><span style>The courage stat he acquired increased his attack and defense at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it still wasn’t enough.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even considering the effect of his courage stat, his starting line was completely different. Therefore, Huroi was lacking in physical ability compared to others of the same level. His Sword Mastery was only intermediate level 2.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would take more time for Huroi to demonstrate the true combat ability of his class.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, things changed recently thanks to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid created and produced the Mass-produced One-handed Sword (Prototype) for him, which was enough to cover Huroi’s lacking combat power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the power of items.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Swaeek!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The black sword that the group was confronted with!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shay’s group tried to get revenge on Grid, but they would die without seeing him?&nbsp;</span><span style>No.&nbsp;</span><span style>They still had a means.&nbsp;</span><span style>Just before his heart was pierced by the sword, Shay shouted urgently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kasim!!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment.&nbsp;</span><span style>A shadow emerged from behind Shay and wielded his daggers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The movements were as fast as lightning.&nbsp;</span><span style>The dagger blocked the black sword and then sliced at Huroi’s neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 4,140 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bleeding Huroi retreated and immediately took a potion to restore his health.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was instincts that caused him to move and avoid death.&nbsp;</span><span style>The person who appeared from the shadow, Kasim, looked at Huroi and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You escaped a fatal wound? Your sensitivity is better than I thought?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He isn’t a player?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a thin man wrapped in grey clothing.&nbsp;</span><span style>The name ‘Kasim’ floating above his head was green, indicating an NPC.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi was baffled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'An NPC assassin is escorting them.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t a normal assassin. Huroi lost 4,000 health from one blow. It was estimated that the opponent was at least a level 280 named assassin.&nbsp;</span><span style>How did Shay’s party get such a big shot as an escort?&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi was questioning it while Shay overcame his confusion and shouted while taking a health potion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Willingly give up your life! Kasim is a third advancement assassin! You’re not his opponent!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Third advancement class?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi started sweating.&nbsp;</span><span style>The abilities of a second and third advancement class were as different as the sky and the earth.&nbsp;</span><span style>If two level 299 and one level 300 person fought, the third advancement level 300 person would win.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, Huroi was only level 236. Not just the class difference, but the level difference was enormous. For him, the current situation wasn’t good. He had to judge carefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Calm down.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t a matter of pride. He didn’t know who these people were and he didn’t want to die.&nbsp;</span><span style>First, he had to escape from them and secure his safety. Then he would send a whisper to Euphemina.&nbsp;</span><span style>As Huroi was making a decision, Shay’s party became excited and their momentum increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We completed a S-grade quest and paid a huge sum of money to hire Kasim! All in order to get revenge on Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Before we kill Grid, we will experiment with Kasim’s power on you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They wanted to hurt Grid?&nbsp;</span><span style>He finally figured out why he was attacked.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi froze in place instead of stepping back.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he glared like a devil at Shay’s party.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You guys, I will kill you here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would wipe out Shay’s group, even if he died from that NPC assassin.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was his duty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will never let you see My Lord’s shadow!”&nbsp;</span><span style>The furious Huroi summoned his drake.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Descend! Lord of the Skies above the Grasslands!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The naming sense of the Mongols was emotional and descriptive.&nbsp;</span><span style>The fire drake ‘Lord of the Skies above the Grasslands’ flew above Huroi’s head.&nbsp;</span><span style>Shay’s party were pushed back against the walls by the wind pressure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Drake...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the National Competition, the drakes had lost most of their dignity.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the pet marathon, dozens of drakes were defeated by Grid’s cat.&nbsp;</span><span style>Some people dismissed drakes, stating that their reputation was exaggerated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But what was the truth?&nbsp;</span><span style>Drakes were still great pets.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their combat ability, mobility, intelligence, stamina, and all other abilities were overwhelming.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s cat, the best demonic beast of hell, was just unusually strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This guy has strong items and a strong pet? What the, you! You are compatible with Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi didn’t respond to the shouting Shay. He just commanded the drake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Turn these people to ashes. I acknowledge you. You are the strongest drake, so you can do it.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaaaaah! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[Your drake ‘Lord of the Skies above the Grasslands’ was inspired by your words and his morale has risen. His attack power and magic power has greatly increased.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hwaruruk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The drake was powered by the orator’s buff skill and spewed out a mighty fire breath.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was a narrow alley.&nbsp;</span><span style>Shay’s party couldn’t escape it, while Winston became covered with flames.&nbsp;</span><span style>Many people witnessed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? A drake?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow... Is it a fight between rankers?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"In the middle of the city? Amazing! Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was there anything more fun than watching a fight?&nbsp;</span><span style>This was a great opportunity to enjoy it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Numerous users and people scattered around the city rushed in the direction of the turmoil.&nbsp;</span><span style>The soldiers also saw it and hurried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Captain! We have to hurry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Go ahead and bring the guards!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Winston’s security policies were excellent!&nbsp;</span><span style>The guards took pride in this. They immediately went to the scene of the crime in order to calm the turmoil.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the security chief was the problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We need to turn off the lights. Wind...? Fan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The chief of the security forces saw the flames burning the city and wondered what was necessary to suppress the fire.&nbsp;</span><span style>The person was none other than Jude.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to evenly grow his stats, Grid had given him all types of tasks such as monster subjugation, security activities, minerals extraction, sparring, etc.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"First of all, a fan. Please.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jude's intelligence was at the level of an idiot.&nbsp;</span><span style>He came up with a stupid answer to the troubled guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fans won’t be able to stop this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Bring in others to put it out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guards urged him.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, Jude reached the limits of his patience.&nbsp;</span><span style>As always, he didn’t think.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fire didn’t matter.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would go there and see.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He forgot about Grid’s urging to always think carefully before acting, and chose swiftness.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tadak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘Fast!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guards were dismayed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jude ran three times faster than them despite wearing full-plate armor and carrying a 3m long greatsword on his shoulder. He didn’t look like a human in their eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Indeed, there was a reason for his ignorance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At Khan’s smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hrmm, isn’t there a splendid fight over there?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Euphemina’s eyes shone as she discovered the fire outside the window.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I will go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For Euphemina, fights were important.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an opportunity to duplicate outstanding skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>She, like everyone else, ran straight in the direction of the turmoil.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to this, Khan was finally able to breathe.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was able to take a break for the first time today as the customers ran out towards the fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Winston Castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had one habit.&nbsp;</span><span style>He disassembled and assembled items every day to increase the understanding of items.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had reached 100% understanding with Dainsleif a long time ago, so now he was devoted to disassembling and assembling the Holy Light Armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was waiting for Euphemina at the castle’s smithy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he heard the soldiers rushing towards the flames that were soaring in the area where Khan’s smithy was located.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Khan...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was Khan in danger?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid worriedly ran out of the smithy, then equipped Braham’s Boots and flew into the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel followed behind him.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The fire drake’s greatest strength was their high damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>The drake’s fire breath was the strongest among any other drakes.&nbsp;</span><span style>However.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is this possible...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi couldn’t believe the sight in front of him.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment that Lord of the Skies above the Grasslands fired his breath.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kasim summoned dozens of shadow soldiers as a barrier, completely blocking the breath.&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to that, the breath didn’t cover Shay’s group and scattered in all directions. There was a sea of fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How does an assassin have that type of defensive capabilities?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>An assassin was agile. They had outstanding attack power and mobility. On the other hand, their defensive ability was poor.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Kasim use the shadow soldiers as shields and showed excellent defense. He was completely different from the known concepts of assassins.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shay shouted to the stunned Huroi.&nbsp;</span><span style>"This is the power of the third advancement! It’s my future! How about it? Isn’t it a class completely incomparable to an orator? Hahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Assassins were classified into four major categories.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were those who specialized in stealth and assassination like Faker, those who used swords like Shay, those who threw weapons like Sniffer and those who installed traps like Kerb. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But that was the case for second advancement assassins. A third advancement assassin had more techniques.&nbsp;</span><span style>One of them was shadows.&nbsp;</span><span style>The shadow technique allowed the assassin to perfect assimilate to other’s shadows, move between shadows or even summon shadow soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And Kasim was a master of shadows.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the peak of the assassins, only rivaled by Doran.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wasn’t someone that the present Huroi could deal with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let’s play a little bit.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sururuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kasim disappeared into Shay’s shadow. Then he appeared in the shadow behind Huroi and wielded his dagger.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 4,010 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ugh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kasim relentlessly aimed at the weak points. It was impossible to defend or avoid.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Huroi tried to fight back, Kasim would hide in the shadows again so it was useless.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he attacked the shadow, Kasim would reappear in the shadows of other objects.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a spectacular sight.&nbsp;</span><span style>The people who gathered admired it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is terrific. What is that skill?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A hidden class?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Assassin...? Considering that he’s an NPC, is he a third advancement class?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wow, this is a big hit. I’m going to be an assassin.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sakak!</span></i> <i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi lost most of his health after being attacked by Kasim, who used all the shadows around him. He would’ve died already if it wasn’t for the drake protecting him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Apostle of Justice’s Partner’s bravery is unmatched. Your current health has fallen below 20%, so all stats will increase by 30%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was his last chance.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was strengthened so he needed to defeat Shay’s group now.&nbsp;</span><span style>After judging that Kasim had disappeared into the shadows again, he headed towards the giggling Shay’s group, who were caught off guard.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then something rose from Shay’s shadow.&nbsp;</span><span style>A shadow soldier.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwachak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi’s desperate sword swing collided with a shadow soldier and was nullified.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment that Huroi felt despair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This isn’t fun. I will end it quickly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kasim emerged from the shadow behind Huroi and pointed his dagger at Huroi’s neck.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then a woman’s voice was heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Raise Shadow Soldiers.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuoooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kasim was amazed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Shadow soldiers rose in the vicinity and attacked him?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Chaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kasim’s attack was defeated and he lost interest in Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The same technique as mine was used?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did that mean there was an assassin with a similar level in the area?&nbsp;</span><span style>Kasim started to observe the spectators. He commanded the shadow soldiers in the crowd and quickly discover who was attacking him.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a blonde girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kasim thought it was ridiculous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"An assassin wouldn’t have such white skin. Then how did you use the shadows technique?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blonde girl, Euphemina replied to Kasim.&nbsp;</span><span style>"What is this? Is it a technique that only you can use?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kukuk...! Stop talking nonsense!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It must be black magic.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kasim ignored the shadow soldiers and focused on Huroi. He would take care of that girl after killing his target.&nbsp;</span><span style>However.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A cold voice was heard from above.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kasim and Huroi. Thousands of spectators, including Euphemina and Jude, turned their gaze towards the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shay shouted,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>The person who appeared in the sky was Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The spectators’ eyes shone like lanterns.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“God Grid! God Grid has showed up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma's Descendant...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kyaaak! Oppa!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, he was really popular. Everyone praised Grid, irrespective of national and gender.&nbsp;</span><span style>People shouted at Grid to look at them and enthusiastically waved their arms.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid’s eyes were only fixed on Kasim.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t like Kasim pointing a dagger at the wounded Huroi’s neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Take your hands off what is mine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The command entered Kasim’s ears, who replied.&nbsp;</span><span style>“What if I don’t want to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then die.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chwachwachwachwachwachwa!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Seven golden blades were revealed as everyone was paying attention.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the special item of Pagma's Descendant that attracted the attention of the world at the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>People were excited, while Kasim breathed out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Artifacts that move by themselves?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He originally didn’t feel anything remarkable from Grid. But he seemed to be more than what Shay’s group told him.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, there was a boy with silver hair with him.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the more important thing...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why does he have Doran’s Ring?’&nbsp;</span><span style>Kasim’s attention was stolen by the blue ring on Grid’s finger.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘This is interesting. I need to learn a bit more, rather than fighting needlessly.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Kasim let Huroi go. Then he disappeared into the shadows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shay’s group was left alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>How could they think that Kasim would flee? How much money did they spend to hire him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is this a lie?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smiled at Shay’s party who couldn’t grasp the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You came again? Did you come to give me more items? Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid showed the Kenen’s Belt, the trap installation tool and poison blender that he received from them. They wanted to kill him even more.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, it was an impossible task without Kasim.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Haha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shay’s group laughed awkwardly, but Grid asked coldly,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Is something funny?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to realizing his strong sense of camaraderie at the National Competition, Grid was furious at the people who hurt Huroi.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was pulling out Failure to kill them when Lauel stopped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Imprison them instead of killing them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why? Isn’t that a waste of the taxpayer’s money?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel whispered to the grim-looking Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If a criminal is put in prison, the ruler can check the criminal’s belongings. You can dispose of them after asking Lady Irene to check the items they have. Anyway, can’t you kill PK users at any time? It is more beneficial to trade them the items for their lives.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel had a lot of ideas and knowledge. Therefore, he was always helpful.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the reason his mother told him to make smart friends when he was in elementary school.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was convinced and ordered Jude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lock them up in jail.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina approached him.&nbsp;</span><span style>She carried the production method to create the best orb associated with Braham.</span></p>
