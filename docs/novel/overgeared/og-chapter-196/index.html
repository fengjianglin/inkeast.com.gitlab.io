 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee was in her second year of high school, and she was a girl who only knew about studying.&nbsp;</span><span style>She studied all day, except for jogging in the morning and yoga in the evening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Idol music, makeup, dramas, shopping, etc.&nbsp;</span><span style>She wasn’t interested in all the hobbies that other girls her age enjoyed.&nbsp;</span><span style>She only went to school, the library, and home.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was studying interesting?&nbsp;</span><span style>No.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was due to her strong sense of responsibility.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was worried about her brother and determined to succeed in order to support her family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But then her brother succeeded.&nbsp;</span><span style>He became the best celebrity and was economically wealthy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to that, Sehee was able to escape the obsession that she should do well for her brother.&nbsp;</span><span style>She still studied, but wouldn’t it be nice to have a hobby? She had room enough to think.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And the thing she became most interested in was Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>She couldn’t ignore the game that many people in the world were enjoying, and a strong point was that she could enjoy it with her brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Saturday at 1 p.m.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee visited a capsule room for the first time in her life with Yerim.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey~ aren’t the two of you really pretty? I will play with you, giving you items and helping you hunt. Just let me know your game IDs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Come here and sit down. I’ll buy you some drinks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of the capsule room customers were university students.&nbsp;</span><span style>Most workers enjoyed Satisfy at home by purchasing a capsule directly, but the capsule fee was too expensive for students.&nbsp;</span><span style>Some university students lied to their parents about going to school and headed to the capsule room instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow~ that uniform! Young Ladies High School?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow. Isn’t Young Ladies High School ranked in the top 10? These pretty girls are good at studying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Students of the Young Ladies High School are great. Please marry me. Yes~?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For university students who were interested in the opposite sex, the emergence of beautiful girls like Sehee and Yerim was an exciting event.&nbsp;</span><span style>They persistently clung to Sehee and Yerim.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How cheap.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>To Yerim, these people looked like nerdy university students. She decided to teach these guys who didn’t know the world about how fearful women could be by eating their items and capsule fees.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yerim’s eyes curved as she started to smile.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee noticed Yerim was emitting her distinctive pose to deceive a man and urgently restrained her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just ignore them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee hated all men except for her father and brother. She kept attracting men due to her innate beauty, but she found it annoying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hrmm~"</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was like the old days, Yerim would’ve thoroughly tricked the university students without listening to Sehee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I don’t want to have any clashes with my future sister-in-law.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yerim easily followed Sehee’s words.&nbsp;</span><span style>Afterwards, they connected to Satisfy and created a character in the city called Reinhardt, the capital of the Eternal Kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style>As they were people experiencing virtual reality for the first time, they were astonished at the implementation of their five senses that was just like reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yerim moved her body back and forth, drinking in the clean air when she suddenly grumbled.&nbsp;</span><span style>“What is this? Why don’t you want to tell your brother that we started the game? Isn’t it more comfortable and enjoyable to play with him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If Oppa knows that I started Satisfy, he’ll order a capsule for me. Not long ago, I rejected his offer to buy me a capsule.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yerim’s eyes started sparkling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Youngwoo oppa is truly great. What brother would buy a 10 million won machine for his sister? It’s on a different level from my brother. Then..."&nbsp;</span><span style>Yerim didn’t understand why Sehee was reluctant to have her brother buy her a capsule.&nbsp;</span><span style>"If your brother wants to buy it, shouldn’t you just accept gratefully? Why did you refuse?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee was worried about her brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don’t want to spend money just because Oppa is making it. I want Oppa to value his money and save it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy’s popularity seemed eternal for now, but she didn’t know about the future. What if one day, a virtual reality game bigger than Satisfy was released? At that time, her brother’s income would decrease.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee hoped that her brother would become someone who thought about the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I had a capsule, wouldn’t I use it all the time? It’s a luxury. Once I get a job and buy a capsule using my own money, then I’ll tell Oppa that I’m playing Satisfy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yerim clicked her tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Amazing, amazing. You’re a very virtuous woman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someday when she married Youngwoo, it would be very tiring to have Sehee as a sister-in-law.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yerim opened the map. Then along with Sehee, she started exploring Reinhardt.&nbsp;</span><span style>The scenery of Reinhardt was very beautiful, looking much bigger and more spectacular than medieval movies that cost hundreds of millions to produce. Due to the wealth of things to see, the two girls didn’t know how to spend their time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Those girls are pretty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"An Oriental girl is white, but aren’t they whiter than white? There are no flaws. A complete milky skin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"They look like complete noobs... Isn’t there a chance to become friends if we help them on a quest or hunt?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Yerim and Sehee was followed by a lot of male users. Two girls with prominent beauty were walking beside each other, so it was natural for them to catch the attention of men.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, Yerim had the ID of Sexy Schoolgirl, so many men were interested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Schoolgirl...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Sexy Schoolgirl...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Her ID is actually Sexy Schoolgirl...’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gulp!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The male users couldn’t help gulping!&nbsp;</span><span style>Suddenly, a quest window appeared before them as they watched the girls with serpentine eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Fight the Golems]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Difficulty: B~S</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Conditions: Repel the golems.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Rewards:</span></p>
 <p><span style>After defeating an old golem, 300 gold and 100 kingdom contribution will be acquired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After defeating a soul doll, 1,000 gold and 500 kingdom contribution will be acquired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After defeating an ancient weapon, 3,000 gold and 1,500 kingdom contribution will be acquired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huh, it is finally here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t the rewards greater than expected?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It means the opponents are tough. Anyway, it is good. This is an opportunity to reverse my life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The users already knew that the golem army was advancing to Reinhardt.&nbsp;</span><span style>They rushed out of the city to defeat the golems.&nbsp;</span><span style>Meanwhile, Yerim and Sehee were confused after being given the quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I was just walking and I received a quest? Was it originally like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What are golems?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I saw them in movies. They are giants made of stone, but very solid and strong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Strong? Can we get rid of them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don’t know...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The male users approached the two stunned girls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Golems are monsters that beginners can’t deal with. Don’t even think about leaving the city, or you will be wiped out in two minutes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The users who approached with friendly smiles were armed with brilliant armor and weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was in stark contrast to Sehee and Yerim, who wore shabby clothing.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yerim’s eyes widened and glistened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh my, really? The rewards are too tempting. As beginners, do we have no chance for the rewards? Right?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yerim’s seduction was a truly great thing.&nbsp;</span><span style>The male users were dazzled by her eyes and nodded excitedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You can get the rewards if you party with us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really! We can defeat the golems, so you can get the rewards just by watching!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yerim was pleased by the reaction and laughed. Then she raised a hand and asked,&nbsp;</span><span style>“So, who are the cool men who will invite us to the party?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, come with us, Sexy Schoolgirl!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I have the highest level here! Come to our party!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Users over level 150 competed to get two level 1 users into their party.&nbsp;</span><span style>As the situation grew bigger, Sehee sighed with a troubled expression while Yerim laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then after a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two girls were shocked at the cruel scene in front of them.&nbsp;</span><span style>The party of 22 men who were over level 150 left the gate and all 22 men were instantly defeated by a huge golem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"H-Hik!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“S-Save me...!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Screams were occurring everywhere.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee and Yerim were still underage so the protection system worked, meaning they didn’t see blood splattering and wounds were blurred.&nbsp;</span><span style>But they still felt fear and disgust at the sight of people being killed by golems.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooof...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee and Yerim were nauseous at the sight of people they just talked to dying, and fled back to the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, beginners slowly adapted to the system by hunting small creatures such as rabbits and deer. Therefore, the two girls received a big shock because they witnessed the death of humans as soon as they started Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s too cruel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh my god, what is this terrible game?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hundreds of thousands of people were crowded in the city.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were those who came to fight the golems realized the powerlessness and withdrew, the merchants, the frightened NPCs and the beginners.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All types of people gathered.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee and Yerim were pushed by the crowd and suffered trying to take just one step.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We can’t move because of all the people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Uhh I chose the city that was first ranked in the recommendations, so what is this situation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at this time.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuuong!</span></i> <i><span style>Kuuong!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The huge 10m walls of Reinhardt were unable to cope with the magic energy fired by the ancient weapons and collapsed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kyaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“R-Run away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soul dolls and old golems moved through the destroyed walls and started to indiscriminately attack people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The armies of the nobles that were gathered from all over the place resisted, but they were helpless. The average level of the soldiers was 60~90, so they died in one blow from the golems. Unless they were top rankers, the users also had difficulty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was truly hell.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee and Yerim’s first sight of Satisfy was truly terrible.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were in tears as they watched the expressionless golems killing the screaming users and NPCs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Scary...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Those cruel monsters are killing children! Bad people!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was true.&nbsp;</span><span style>The golems were killing all humans indiscriminately.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even users who could resurrect again were running away from the golems, so what about the NPCs?&nbsp;</span><span style>Those who had a finite life tried their best to escape from the golems.&nbsp;</span><span style>But they were so many people that it wasn’t easy to move. Some people died from being trampled by others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhh! Mother! Mother!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A five year old child lost his mother in the crowd. He cried and fell down.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Grrr...!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Then a huge shadow covered the boy’s small body.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an old golem.&nbsp;</span><span style>It’s huge hand descended towards the boy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee was surprised and reflexively moved her body. There was no time for Yerim to stop her. Sehee was acting in the hope that she could somehow save that boy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most users considered NPCs as artificial intelligences and masses of data, but Sehee had been in Satisfy for less than an hour and didn’t know about NPCs.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuuong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee embraced the boy and prepared for death.&nbsp;</span><span style>The golem’s merciless hand flew towards her back.&nbsp;</span><span style>People thought that both the boy and Sehee would die.&nbsp;</span><span style>But there were numerous knights and soldiers here in Reinhardt.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t strange that someone found the people in crisis and ran to save them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Fortunately, their savior was very strong.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Phoenix, the strongest knight of the north, blocked the golem’s hand with the Sword of Self-transcendence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Flee with the child!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T-Thank you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee thanked him and lifted the boy. In a corner of her vision, notification windows emerged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You are weak. Nevertheless, you have the spirit of sacrifice to save others. You will be an example to the people.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have reached the conditions required to become the growth type hidden class ‘Saintess.’]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A level 1 female user willing to sacrifice herself for a NPC.&nbsp;</span><span style>If someone fulfilled this condition in Satisfy, they would receive the hidden class called ‘Saintess.’&nbsp;</span><span style>The Saintess was Satisfy’s strongest healer, who could heal with her own abilities without borrowing the divine powers of Goddess Rebecca.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a hidden healing class that could reign supreme in Satisfy, and the one who obtained it was the younger sister of the first legendary class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A hidden class?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee might be a beginner in Satisfy, but she knew the greatness of a hidden class.&nbsp;</span><span style>A soul doll approached her as she was feeling stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Danger!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, it was Yerim’s turn.&nbsp;</span><span style>She pushed Sehee aside and faced the soul doll instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment.&nbsp;</span><span style>A blue greatsword fell from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The soul doll hit by Grid was unable to cope with the shock and collapsed.</span></p>
