 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Put that decoration here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey, the new curtain color doesn’t match the wallpaper. Change it back to the previous one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Chef! Is the food preparation finished?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There’s dust left on the carpet! Clean again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>80 servants working in Winston Castle were busy.&nbsp;</span><span style>In a little while, Winston’s top VIP would be here.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Steim was the one who invited the VIP, but he didn’t look pleased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don’t like it....’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene was Earl Steim’s only child. She was truly a lovely daughter. He was confident that she was the most beautiful and gentlest woman in the world.&nbsp;</span><span style>Therefore, he thought that her husband should at least be the prince of another country.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then!</span></p>
 <p><span style>His precious daughter, famous for being aloof in social circles, had her heart taken by a con artist! What a blunder!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hum hum hum~”&nbsp;</span><span style>Irene was smiling happily and humming to herself. She seemed like a new bride waiting for her husband.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Steim’s expression became increasingly darker.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘That person called Grid... No matter how I think about it, he’s just a scammer.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was the hero who saved Winston from the Mero Company and previous lord, and the one who made the Sword of Self-transcendence that was a new heirloom in their family. Above all, he saved Irene’s life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, wasn’t it just words?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t believe that the young blacksmith who made the best sword would be skilled enough in the sword to kill Malacus, one of the Eight Servants, and rescue Irene from the remaining Yatan followers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was impossible the more he thought about it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Perhaps Irene was deceived by him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘My daughter... You’re being fooled by a scammer... You don’t have any eye for men. Come on Grid! I will reveal that you are a scammer!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lord Earl.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A young man approached Earl Steim.&nbsp;</span><span style>His blond hair made him look like he was the protagonist of a romantic drama. His luxurious attire and elegant demeanor made it obvious that he was a noble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His name was Bland de Ian.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the son of Earl Ashur, lord of the south, and a disciple of Earl Steim. In addition, he was Irene’s childhood friend.&nbsp;</span><span style>Having adored Irene since childhood, he was filled with greater anger and jealousy than Earl Steim.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve thought about it all night, and that person called Grid is definitely a con artist.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Steim nodded.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I was thinking the same thing. So let’s wait for him to come. We will reveal the truth!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then after a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Steim, Bland and Irene anxiously waited for Grid with different feelings.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was delivered by a knight and kneeled down in front of Earl Steim.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I greet the great lord of the north, Earl Steim.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid usually wore scruffy beginner’s clothing, but he was worried about meeting nobles. On the way to the castle, he stopped by a clothing store and bought clothes worth one gold.&nbsp;</span><span style>But while the one gold clothes might seem luxurious for beginners, it looked cheap even for mid level users, and the materials weren’t good. In the eyes of the nobles, he was like a beggar.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘His appearance is shabby...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t just Grid’s clothing. The forearms and shoulder muscles showed that his body was trained, but it wasn’t at a special level.&nbsp;</span><span style>There wasn’t one element where Grid was superior to Bland. Bland was sure of this and shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who are you? Even if you are a commoner, shouldn’t you know the basic etiquette?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid made a mistake.&nbsp;</span><span style>Originally when greeting the nobility, it was a etiquette to reveal his identity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>'It was a mistake I made after not meeting nobles for a long time. But even so...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid looked at the noble with the name ‘Bland’ over his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Why is that jerk so high-strung and tense?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was aware of the reason why he was brought here.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the creator of the Sword of Self-transcendence and the hero who saved both Winston and Irene, so Earl Steim was probably going to reward his achievements.&nbsp;</span><span style>But instead of a warm welcome, he received this unpleasant reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he remained patient.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'This isn’t just any noble... Earl Steim might become my father-in-law so...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smiled and corrected his mistake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The blacksmith Grid living in Winston greets the lord of the north, Earl Steim.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Steim nodded.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Ah, yes. I have heard the story. Thus, I am glad to meet you. However... You introduced yourself as a blacksmith? I heard you are also an excellent swordsman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid humbly explained,&nbsp;</span><span style>"I’m not a swordsman. My main vocation is a blacksmith, and my swordsmanship is just shallow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huh, it must not be shallow if you manage to defeat Malacus. Shouldn’t you be the best?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t defeat Malacus alone. It was with my colleagues.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But isn’t it true that you defeated dozens of Yatan followers? Irene was a direct witness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is true but... The followers of Yatan were so weak that I could deal with them with my shallow fencing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah... The followers are Yatan are weak? If they are so insignificant, how have they troubled the soldiers and people of this land for decades? Is it true that your opponents were the Yatan followers? In the first place, was it the Yatan Church who actually kidnapped Irene? Perhaps someone deceived Irene in order to make himself stand out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rather than being rewarded, Earl Steim was pushing the conversation in a strange direction.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid grasped the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Earl Steim, I sold you the Sword of Self-transcendence and saved your daughter’s life, but you are making me out to be a con artist?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very unpleasant.&nbsp;</span><span style>Anger flared inside Grid. He had tried to show humility because the other person was a noble.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s face turned red as Irene came forward,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Father! What do you mean by that? Are you suspicious of Grid right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right!”&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Steim snapped and got up from his seat. Then he spoke bluntly.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Grid! I’m sorry, but aren’t you too suspicious? You’re the greatest blacksmith on the continent and the strongest swordsman at the same time? Common sense suggests that it isn’t possible! First, I have to check if your swordsmanship is real or not. Bland!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, My Lord!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When Earl Steim called, Bland pulled out his sword like he had been waiting. Then he rushed towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Yes, this is better.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Honestly, this method was better to resolve their doubts. Grid thought positively and pulled Dainsleif out of his inventory. He jumped forward and shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is how it is! Yes, my swordsmanship isn’t shallow! I will show you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Are you prepared? I will defeat you now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bland jumped up and aimed his sword towards Grid’s head.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bland was perplexed. The striking force that had the weight of his body applied was rendered ineffective by that big sword in Grid’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Che! I guess he trained up his strength and muscle development!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bland determined that it was difficult to compete with strength, so he used the repulsive force to spin in the air and land. Then he lowered his body as much as possible and attacked Grid’s lower body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid stuck his greatsword to the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bland’s sword flying towards Grid’s ankles was blocked by the greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He’s good at fighting!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A chill went down Bland’s spine. He was certain that Grid was a scammer due to his appearance, but what was this? He hurriedly moved as Grid drew up his feet. A kick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Cough..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bland coughed out some gastric juices.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid stood over him and said,&nbsp;</span><span style>"You are like a kid who only fought in your house... No, I’m sorry to your sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T-This guy...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>NPC knights had a minimum level of 180. Among the knights, Bland was one of the most talented and had a level of 200.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yet he was overwhelmed by Grid who was only level 114.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was inevitable. Grid’s stats were high enough to be considered level 200, and the items he used had a level limit of over 200. In particular, Dainsleif was the strongest weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style>His stats, skills, items and combat experience made the difference in level meaningless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Bland was also a formidable presence.&nbsp;</span><span style>His father Earl Ashur was one of the best magicians in the Eternal Kingdom. He’d also inherited his father’s talent for magic.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s right. He was a magic swordsman. It wasn’t attack or defense magic, but buff and debuffs which were the most powerful in a one-on-one match.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sword’s Grace! Armor’s Will!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bland’s sword and armor started to shine blue. It was imbued with the power of magic.&nbsp;</span><span style>This wasn’t the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Storm’s Fury!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heavy winds stirred around Bland. The wind magic increased the speed of his blade and provided a certain amount of shielding.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Now I will unconditionally win!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bland regained his confidence,&nbsp;</span><span style>"I am the youngest son of the great magician, Earl Ashur! It is possible for me to use powerful magic! Hahaha! Can you go against Earl Steim’s swordsmanship and my father’s magic?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Earl Ashur...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s face distorted at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Ashur!&nbsp;</span><span style>Who was he?&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the lord of the fortified city Patrian, and the one who ordered Grid to find the Northern End Cave and obtain Pagma’s Rare Book.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the time, Grid was forced to take a quest that didn’t fit his level and suffered for months.&nbsp;</span><span style>He experienced more than a dozen deaths, lost many items and became broke, increasing the risk of being chased after by the creditors.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had really wanted to quit the game. Logging into the game itself was like hell. He would rather go into the army one more time. An average person would’ve given up the game.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s only advantage was his patience, so he persevered and persevered until he finally found Pagma’s Rare Book.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he wasn’t greeted with a happy ending. All the reputation he built up with Earl Ashur and Patrian turned into infamy and he was killed by Earl Ashur’s knight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a result of Earl Ashur, Grid was able to change to Pagma’s Descendant and reverse his life, but that was all due to Grid’s efforts. Grid was only filled with hostile emotions towards Ashur.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oho, you are Earl Ashur’s son?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had promised several times that he would someday kill Earl Ashur.&nbsp;</span><span style>And now! He found a target that could get rid of some of that deep grudge.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bland in front of him had identified himself as Earl Ashur’s son.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bland was still unable to grasp the atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha! You are afraid after knowing my identity! But it is too late! You will be completely trampled on by me!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bland grew up as a member of the nobility and was always victorious thanks to his outstanding talents. He was very confident in himself. He didn’t think that the commoner in front of him could be stronger than himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lord of the Storm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bland’s debuff magic aimed at Grid and strong winds started to press at him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid couldn’t move even one hand.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bland smiled with satisfaction and rushed towards Grid, stabbing forward with his magic enhanced sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A strong wind has suppressed your body. Agility will become zero for two seconds and you can’t move.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid scoffed as he checked the notification window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Pagma? Pagma?! Don't tell me?'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Steim was shocked as he heard Grid’s voice. Grid unleashed a dazzling sword dance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Link!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeong!</span></i> <i><span style>Jjejejeok!</span></i> <i><span style>Pepepepeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The greatsword swiftly moved 10 times, regardless of its heavy weight.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bland’s attack was easily neutralized and the wind shield protecting Bland’s body shattered. Even his armor strengthened by magic was torn apart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bland couldn’t believe it.&nbsp;</span><span style>How could this man move freely? And what was this beam of light?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pipipipit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bland’s body was swept by the 10 silver lights of different orbits, causing him to bleed and kneel down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'This can’t be...! This is me! Me!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t show this shameful image in front of the woman he liked and his respected teacher.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bland didn’t want it to end like this. He wanted to get up and kill Grid right now. But his wounded body didn’t move as intended.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid snorted and turned his gaze towards Earl Steim. Then he straightened and asked,&nbsp;</span><span style>"With this, are there any doubts about my swordsmanship? Shall I show you my blacksmithing skills next? Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes! This is good! Okay! I want to know everything about you! But before that!’&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Steim ran up in front of Grid. He grasped both of Grid’s hands and pleaded.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Grid! Please take my daughter as your bride!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The greatest blacksmith and swordsman in history.&nbsp;</span><span style>The name of this famous person was Pagma. Earl Steim had realized that Grid was Pagma's Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Grid was the first to obtain the status of a noble’s son-in-law from among the two billion users playing Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the position he failed to obtain in the past after being interrupted by Yura during Doran’s quest.</span></p>
