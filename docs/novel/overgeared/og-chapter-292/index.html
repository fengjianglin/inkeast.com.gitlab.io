 <p><span style>Chapter 292</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[You have been hit by a deadly blow!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 68,300 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A legend doesn’t die easily. You can resist all attacks for 5 seconds with a minimum of health.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>At level 200, one strength stat increased health by five, while one stamina stat increased health by twenty.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he added the 6,000 health from the Holy Light set, and the 3,000 health from the Man who has Touched Hell title, Grid had more than 55,000 health in total.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was 6,000 points higher than Vantner, who already had a high amount of health due to his class characteristics. Therefore, Grid could be called the user with the highest health among the two billion users.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite this fact, however, Elfin Ston’s attack contained an enormous power that wiped out all of Grid’s health in one blow.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Holy Light Armor reduced 50% of magic damage, so this skill could truly be called a blow of death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaak! That crazy bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid died again as soon as the cooldown time of his invincible passive ended, so he couldn’t help being furious. He pulled his hair and stomped his feet.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, the faces of the Overgeared members were rosy.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was thanks to the positive hint they received.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Elfin Stone’s re-emergence cycle is 24 hours.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Elfin Stone attacks the person with the highest number of stats.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elfin Stone is arrogant. He doesn’t have any doubts about Grid being alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He will continue to attack Grid whenever he appears.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is ideal. If this continues, all of us will be able to live until Grid reaches level 300.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We can prepare perfectly for the fight against Elfin Stone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The biggest advantage of a virtual reality was the perfect implementation of the five senses.&nbsp;</span><span style>But this was a great disadvantage in battle.&nbsp;</span><span style>It hurt if the enemy struck you. It wasn’t just their imagination, they really felt pain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suffering a large amount of damage at once was like being hit by a person’s fist.&nbsp;</span><span style>Did he have to suffer from this terrible pain for the next five days until he reached level 300?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was sad.&nbsp;</span><span style>He looked at his happy and laughing colleagues.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t deny that this was a good thing.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid calmed his mind and urged the members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let's move on to the next building."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was eager to reach level 300 quickly so he wouldn’t be hit by that skill so much.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid rushed ahead.&nbsp;</span><span style>The party members followed him to the third building.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had already cleared two buildings, so the cooperative play of Grid’s group had developed. It was easier to kill the vampires.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s experience gauge continued rising at a fast speed.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"I can sleep today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would return to strike terrible fear into the humans who dared invade his city.&nbsp;</span><span style>As soon as he arrived at his mansion, Elfin Stone changed into pajamas and put on a sleeping hat before laying down in a white coffin.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was happy imagining the humans who would be shivering with fear right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Kukuk, they must want to die soon. But I have no intention of killing you all at once. Slowly... Hrmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was sleepy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vampires were powerful existences but they were victims of the ‘Curse of Idleness.’&nbsp;</span><span style>An average vampire slept for 20 hours and the stronger vampires slept for even longer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Elfin Stone was an earl, so he had to sleep for at least 23 hours a day and could sleep for a year straight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone fell asleep.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy’s 8th Development Team Leader, Ashley Tosun.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was one of the 33 scientists who built the virtual reality system with Lim Cheolho.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the company, he was known as the father of vampires.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the one who made the vampires in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, he also designed Elfin Stone.&nbsp;</span><span style>If enemies threatened the city, Elfin Stone would repeat the act of murdering the ‘strongest being’ every 24 hours for seven days.&nbsp;</span><span style>After losing seven of their strongest consecutively, the invading party would panic, lost strength and be destroyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is crazy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 13th city had one of the highest difficulties among the 15 vampire cities.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ashley monitored the entry of Grid’s party and was convinced that their expedition would fail.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, now he felt some doubts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was because Grid’s immortal passive neutralized the characteristics of Elfin Stone.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elfin Stone wasn’t able to distinguish the power of Grid’s group, despite appearing there for the second time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is really...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The problem was that Grid’s attack power, defense, and magic power were the highest among the party members.&nbsp;</span><span style>Originally, Pagma's Descendant wasn’t a class that could be strengthened to such a degree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment five legendary items were made, their stats growth would gradually fall and their combat power gradually weakened, making them more suitable as a production class.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was unlucky so it took a long time to produce five legendary items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a factor that wasn’t expected and as a result, Grid’s stats were abnormally increased.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to that, Grid succeeded in various raids and continued to grow stronger.&nbsp;</span><span style>The process was tough, but it was a good outcome for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe this... He might collect all the pieces?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Team Leader Ashley had an expression of interest on his face.&nbsp;</span><span style>Following Lim Cheolho and Yoon Sangmin, another fan of Grid’s appeared in the S.A. Group.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Good!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s party cleared the third building.&nbsp;</span><span style>The profits from this building were tremendous.&nbsp;</span><span style>No elixirs or spellbooks were obtained, but one vampire’s ring was acquired.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was regretful that it was just from a junior vampire, but it was millions of times better than nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a short discussing, the party chose Peak Sword as the owner of the ring.&nbsp;</span><span style>His offensive power as a swordsman was the best among the group, so he could maximize the effectiveness of the ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have a vampire accessory...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword was full of strong motivation as they challenged the hunting grounds. It was really good that he merged with Overgeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword’s endurance in battle dramatically increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hidden Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a class with a fatal disadvantage in that both general attacks and skills must go through the process of the sword being drawn, so the attack time was too long.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the attack power and attack speed were both at the top.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the sword hidden in the sheath was revealed, the target was already wounded.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now the vampires suffered from it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T-These humans...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fourth building had a structure similar to a cathedral.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were coffins jammed together between long benches. It seemed to be a meeting place for vampires.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Taack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Peak Sword leaped over the benches and pulled his sword from his sheath.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There was a flash of light and blood burst from a vampire’s chest.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was very difficult to fight against this invisible and fast attack.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeong!</span></i> <i><span style>Jjang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword didn’t even allow a counterattack.&nbsp;</span><span style>He always held his sheath in his hand and used it as a protective shield.&nbsp;</span><span style>His health was maintained thanks to the vampire ring as he blocked the vampires’ attacks and unsheathed his sword again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to Peak Sword’s actions, the fourth building was cleared faster than the third.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Grid was level 299.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was estimated that his experience gauge would reach 20% after the next building.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Okay, not long now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If his stats went through the third awakening, he would be able to beat Elfin Stone, who already attacked him twice.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment Grid was imagining this, a notification window appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The cooldown time of the title skill ‘One who Became a Legend is over.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally this would be good news, but now it was a different matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid braced himself for the pain that was about to come. A blond man appeared above his head.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Elfin Stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t I say I would come back?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puhahahak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A red light swallowed up Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elfin Stone was convinced that Grid had died and shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will come back soon. I will kill another person, and then another one the time after that! This will be repeated again and again. I will show you the extreme taste of fear... Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The excited Elfin Stone shook his head.&nbsp;</span><span style>The number of humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is the same as yesterday?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were nine people yesterday and he killed one, so there should be eight people left?&nbsp;</span><span style>Thinking back, he felt like the number of humans on the first day was nine...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am mistaken.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were no humans who could survive Extreme Blood Transfusion.&nbsp;</span><span style>The humans originally had 11 people.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elfin Stone believed in his skills rather than his memory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now then. I will see you again soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wanted to correct it to tomorrow, rather than soon.&nbsp;</span><span style>The party was convinced that Elfin Stone was very dumb after he disappeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>But in fact, Elfin Stone’s intelligence wasn’t low.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elfin Stone slept for 23 hours a day and was barely awake the rest of the time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was reasonable that he couldn’t remember the exact number of Grid’s party.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why would he need to remember how much prey there was?&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t care about the numbers of Grid’s group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn bastard...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid cursed as the curtain lifted.&nbsp;</span><span style>His items’ durability was already at its limit, and repairs were needed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The legendary blacksmith took out his hammer and repaired his equipment.&nbsp;</span><span style>The party members were envious of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If one’s equipment was damaged during a hunt, then ordinary users would have to repair their equipment using the expensive Repair Tool Set. However, Grid could freely repair his items and even accumulate skill proficiency while doing so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid promised again,</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Elfin Stone...! I will repay this disgrace and inflict double the suffering on you!’</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[The duration of the Experience Increase Potion is over.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, damn.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It happened after clearing the seventh building.&nbsp;</span><span style>His experience gauge hadn’t reached 50% yet, but he heard the worst news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It seems like I have to attack three more buildings before I can level up.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>From level 299, the amount of experience required to level up increased by four times.&nbsp;</span><span style>He needed to kill the vampires without any rest.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elfin Stone appeared again when Grid was fretting.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the fourth appearance.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, this time he was a little strange.&nbsp;</span><span style>He looked at Grid without attacking immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone asked the nervous Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You, why are you still alive?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s party were thunderstruck at the unexpected response.&nbsp;</span><span style>Maybe Elfin Stone would change his behavior pattern and kill them all.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, it was the worst situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m not level 300 yet...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, it couldn’t be helped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There is no way other than to fight.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Grid was about to summon Noe and Randy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your parents must’ve had a hard time after giving birth to you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi revealed his personality.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elfin Stone received a big shock and his handsome face distorted.</span></p>
