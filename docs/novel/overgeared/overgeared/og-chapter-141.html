 <p><span style="">Chapter 141</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">During the three day journey towards the Grey Forest on the outskirts of Bairan, Grid constantly worked Jude and the soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He instructed them to fight the monsters who were drawn by Malacus’ Cloak.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the Bairan monsters had a minimum level of 100, while the Grey Forest monsters had a minimum level of 120.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was hard for the level 70~80 soldiers to fight them. There were the sounds of suffering.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Grid was firm. He never gave orders for the soldiers to retreat. They were forced to fight, even if they had to die. He gave almost no breaks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, the soldiers couldn’t refuse his commands and were forced to fight with a real determination to die. Indeed, they almost died several times.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soldiers no longer regarded Grid as a hero. They thought he was the devil.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Initially, the soldiers thought that this expedition was to torment them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But none of the soldiers lost their lives to the monsters. Every time the soldiers were on the brink of death, Grid and the knights saved them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This repeated for three days, and the average level of the soldiers increased to 90. Jude always fought in the lead and managed to reach level 110.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Certainly... NPCs are different from users.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid realized some new facts.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Users gained 10 fixed stat points every time they gained a level, while NPCs randomly acquired a minimum of 6 to a maximum of 20 stat points.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Every time Jude levelled up, he got at least 16 stat points. Indeed, Grid was interested in a Grade A NPC.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was encouraged.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Yes Jude. Grow quickly. Then become my faithful dog.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The next day, the party finally reached the Grey Forest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From here, the atmosphere became strange.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The spirits of the soldiers that had grown under Grid’s direction faded away in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I-I’m sorry but we can’t move any further.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The start of the forest was covered by a poison fog generated by the poison flowers. A radius of 300m was filled with poison.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The soldiers and knights naturally shrunk back.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were five meters away from the poison, but their skin was already irritated. They could feel their health deteriorating in real time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Romeo judged that stepping into the forest without a Rebecca priest was nothing more than suicide.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It is unreasonable to beat the Guardian of the Forest with this group. It’s impossible to reach the Guardian of the Forest itself. It’s great that we reached here, but we can only turn back...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The knights and soldiers stood still and didn’t move.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid didn’t force them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The poison flowers’ poison fog does 350 damage per second.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Putting aside the knights, the soldiers had less than 3,000 health. If he forced them into the fog, they wouldn’t even be able to move 100m before dying.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid worked hard to train them, so he didn’t want to lose them like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have to go ahead.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The poison flower wasn’t simply a poisonous plant. It was a level 160 carnivorous plant that attacked anything that came into its range with its tentacles. It was the object of complete terror for travellers and monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But the flowers weren't a threat to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The tense Grid put a hand into his inventory. He was planning to take out Dainsleif in order to get rid of the poison flowers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Jude?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jude was silent as usual as he walked forward towards the fog.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was heading towards the poison fog that scared even the knights!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Indeed! He’s a person that I am paying attention to!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was filled with anticipation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What would Jude use to break through the poison fog? He watched with curious eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Jude finally stepped into the fog.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jude’s health gauge started to decline at a tremendous pace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Jude didn’t care. He groaned and kept advancing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he fell down onto the grass.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was perplexed by the unexpected development.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the soldiers were in an uproar.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah Captain! He moved without thinking and is digging his grave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let’s go rescue Captain quickly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shit, we have to go into that poison fog? We’ll die as well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Uhh... Will Captain die like this?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jude’s poisoned gauge was falling quickly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The helpless soldiers were forced to watch as their captain died in front of their eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid noticed his mistake.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Wasn’t he stupid?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Despite repeatedly gaining levels, Jude’s intelligence was still stuck at 11. There was also the unknown skill with the ominous name of ‘I have no Idea.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reason Jude went into the fog wasn’t because he had a means of breaking the fog, but because he had no idea. Grid belatedly discovered this face and hurriedly moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can’t lose him like this!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Viscount!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Romen and Deck cried out. A viscount was throwing himself into poisonous fog just to save a mere captain?&nbsp;</span><span style="">They couldn’t understand Grid’s behavior.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Deck shouted in an urgent voice,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Sir Romeo! If the viscount dies, then we are finished!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Come on...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But it was too late.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s movement speed was superhuman. The moment Romeo and Deck thought to stop him, Grid was already in the middle of the poison fog.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Drink it quickly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His vision became cloudy. A terrible pain filled his body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jude thought he would die like this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Someone suddenly ran up to Jude and raised his body. Then Jude was fed a potion?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The person was Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A noble was willing to risk his life to save a commoner?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Didn’t nobles consider soldiers to be meat shields on the battlefield?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was different from the nobles that Jude had met.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why was he different?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was curious, but Jude’s intelligence couldn’t infer the reason.&nbsp;</span><span style="">So he was just thrilled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then he made a stupid look as tentacles from the poison flowers flew towards him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The tentacles were like flying birds, but none of them could reach Jude.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was natural.&nbsp;</span><span style="">How could level 160 monsters exert their power in front of Grid?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Wave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Swords of light moved in all directions around Grid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The tentacles flying towards Jude were destroyed and dozens of poison flowers screamed. Then the poisonous fog started to disappear like a lie.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jude made a stupid expression and admired Grid’s skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Strong.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Clean air started pouring into the poisoned lungs.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His innate health meant Jude was quickly freed from suffering and he raised his body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he bowed to Grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Thank you."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">These words were too simple towards someone who saved his life.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was embarrassed for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He really is stupid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He told Jude,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“It’s good to be brave, but you should think before moving forward. You don’t have 10 lives, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Um.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jude nodded like he understood.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the expression was too subtle. It was like he didn’t understand what it meant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid felt uncomfortable.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t help feeling anxious.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t a difficult demand. Grid just asked him to be careful. But how stupid was he to not understand?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then the knights and soldiers ran up to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You’re safe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They gazed at Grid with admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s amazing that you can sweep up dozens of poison flowers all at once! This is the majesty of the hero who defeated Malacus!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The acting of rescuing the captain is the epitome of all nobles and knights!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Romeo and Deck started to praise Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The soldiers who misunderstood Grid as a devil once again recognized Grid as a hero.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Viscount is the best!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Thank you for saving the captain!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The cheers from the soldiers and knights!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid smiled at them, but it had an ominous feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“How is it? If you are with me, you can easily defeat the Guardian of the Forest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...No, that...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Despite the fact that Grid had shown his greatness, the knights and soldiers still reacted skeptically to beating the Guardian of the Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t care.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was willful from the beginning, so he just started moving forward again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The knights and soldiers were forced to follow him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the party encountered something in the center of the forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Humans! No humans in forest! Humans pollute forest! No forgive humans!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a goblin lord.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most goblins were around one meter tall, but he was around two meters tall. And his strength was beyond imagination.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a level 180 field boss, he was an intermediate boss that had to be defeated before meeting the Guardian of the Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He summoned dozens of hobgoblins. Grid identified this and began conducting his troops.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is the final training before we defeat the Guardian of the Forest! Three soldiers will mark one hobgoblin, while the knights and Jude will look at the entire battlefield and help those in danger. Once the goblin lord starts acting strange, it is the precursor to an earthquake. At that time, spread out and minimize the damage!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The goblin lord had the same attack pattern as the Guardian of the Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The goblin lord summoned hobgoblins while the Guardian of the Forest summoned golems. The goblin lord also possessed the same wide range earthquake technique as the Guardian of the Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s why Guardian of the Forest raid parties tended to meet the goblin lord before meeting the Guardian of the Forest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had familiarized himself with the process and responded as calmly as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The knights and soldiers marked the hobgoblins according to Grid’s instructions, while Grid approached the goblin lord.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he used Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Kill, in order to suppress it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Holy Light Gloves option effect is activated, causing you to attack the target five times.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 302,555 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have defeated the guard of the Grey Forest, the goblin lord!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[2,600,100 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Goblin Lord’s Club has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Goblin Lord’s fang has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The critical strike combined with the Holy Light Gloves’ option and Kill was a blow that managed to cause the level 280 griffon boss monster to fall into a critical state.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, it easily took care of the level 180 goblin lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Of course, this wasn’t his intention.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why was the power of his items applied at such exquisite timing?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hiik! Humans! Scary!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The hobgoblins ran away with fear while Grid was feeling embarrassed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid grasped the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Damn, I should’ve taken off the gloves.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid felt regret over missing the opportunity to train the troops, while the knights and soldiers were baffled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is that a human?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Ridiculously strong...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The Guardian of the Forest. It’s time to hunt it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the midst of the chaos, only Jude was moving forward without thinking.&nbsp;</span></p>
