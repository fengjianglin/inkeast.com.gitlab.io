 <p><span style="">Chapter 48</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Duplicator, a person who analyzed the skills of others, duplicated them and then could use the skills with no conditions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Duplicators could enjoy all types of benefits depending on the skills they duplicated. It could be anything they wanted. It could be called the most effective of all classes in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were also a specialist in combat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Depending on the skill combination, it was possible to take on a boss raid alone, become the strongest assassin or even fight alone against an army.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A Duplicator was the closest class to being called the ‘strongest’.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, a Duplicator also had fatal disadvantages.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Firstly, it could only duplicate a skill three times a day.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Secondly, the duplicated skill only had a single use.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thirdly, she only nine basic skills, none of which were combat skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Fourthly, the basic physical abilities of a magician were poor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In other words, it meant Euphemina was the strongest when she duplicated a lot of skills, but the weakest when she had few skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And right now, Euphemina was in her weakest mode.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It’s ruined,” said Euphemina, her complexion pale.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid headed to the fourth floor, leaving her alone on the third floor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">While she had defeated hundreds of soldiers that kept appearing, she had used most of her skills in exchange.&nbsp;</span><span style="">To be precise, there were three fire magic spells left. However, it wasn’t possible to use them because fire magic was likely to cause an explosion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In such a situation, four knights appeared as if they had been waiting and surrounded her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m screwed...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were no signs of Grid coming back.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was a massive explosion on the fourth floor, so maybe the worst had happened and Grid died.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If he survived and rescued Huroi, can I guarantee that he will come back here to rescue me?'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Maybe Grid had already escaped alone from the prison?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The knights aimed their swords at Euphemina, who stood idly like her soul had escaped.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You are a ridiculously strong woman who killed more than 500 soldiers alone. Do you have the title of great magician?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Fortunately, the knights didn’t dare attack Euphemina.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She had killed hundreds of soldiers, so it was natural for the knights to be afraid of her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the pointless confrontation didn’t last long.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Now the only troops left in the castle are the lord’s bodyguards. Since there are no forces left to block the exit, Grid might escape while we are tied up here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is there even a chance? Didn’t Leo go down to the fourth floor? Leo has probably already caught up and will happily kill Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The lord’s comfort is at stake. We have to consider and guard against the worst possibility.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes... Then let’s hurry. It isn’t honorable, but I am afraid we will have to fight four against one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The four knights made a decision and rushed at Euphemina at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now Euphemina was forced to make a decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can’t be still.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina took out a gold dice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the Rolling Dice skill that she got for winning the item making game against Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Rolling Dice]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Roll a dice and a phenomenon will occur, depending on the number that is rolled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* If the target is yourself or an ally: There will be a beneficial effect if the number 4 or higher is rolled. There will be a harmful effect if the number rolled is 3 or lower.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* If the target is an enemy: There will be a beneficial effect if the number 3 or lower is rolled. There will be a harmful effect if the number rolled is 4 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Mana Cost: 1,000</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 3,000 seconds&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What if she rolled the dice and the situation became worse?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If the situation becomes too bad, I will use the fire magic.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina didn’t intend to die alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She grumbled but there were still no signs of Grid returning.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She couldn’t imagine how but she would later get revenge on Grid in a terrible way.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that moment!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"These knights ganging up on a weak... no, this woman isn’t weak but still... There is no difference between being gangsters.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“G...rid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina and the knights gazed in the direction of the voice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid and Huroi were standing next to each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina’s face brightened at Grid’s emergence. She thought that Grid was human trash without any loyalty, but he actually wasn’t the worst person. He came back as promised.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Really pretty.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina’s smile was as beautiful as a flower in full bloom, so Grid’s heart couldn’t help pounding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Let’s not be deceived by outward appearances. She just has a beautiful outside that is covering the dirty inside! So don’t run wild, my damn heart!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The knights struggled to maintain their composure as they stared at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“How is that guy here...? Leo, who was called Northern Nova, was killed by a person like you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I don’t know who the Northern Nova is, but that young brat called Leo was easy to handle. One against one. One. Against. One. I killed him. Huhuhut!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The faces of the knights distorted after hearing that their colleague was killed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid didn’t feel fear as he faced them. It was because he believed in something. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, you are angry so what are you going to do? Do you think any of you can touch me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The knights flinched.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Listening to this, wasn’t Grid good enough to destroy Leo?&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were briefly off guard because Grid looked like trash, but he wasn’t easy to deal with.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina felt admiration as she watched the knights stepping back from Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Making the knights back off with just a few words... How high is his level?'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Monsters and NPCs tended to shrink back from opponents more than 30 levels higher than them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, Euphemina misunderstood and thought that Grid’s level was much higher than the knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Meanwhile, Grid kept talking while approaching the knights.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Hey guys, if you don’t want to die a dog like death like Leo, get out of the way. This is your only chance to get away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This guy...!”&nbsp;</span><span style="">A knight was filled with anger and tried to rush forward. But the other knights stopped him</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don't fall for his provocation. I know your skills but you shouldn’t face him alone. It is probably a trap.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Aren’t you overreacting? Think about it calmly. That bastard’s class is a blacksmith! Blacksmiths can’t be that strong!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“But Leo hasn’t come back. I can’t tell if he is a good actor or not, but he is clearly someone to be wary of.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuoh...!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The knights were tense because they were thinking too much, while Grid continued walking forward.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The knights backed away with every step Grid took.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi was thrilled when he witnessed the tremendous sight of Grid overwhelming the four knights alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Truly amazing... Grid’s outward appearance might seem insignificant but he is actually a tremendous high-level user who made the knights tremble in fear. The other day I saw him in the smithy and treated him as a comedian. I am ashamed of my eyes.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">From Euphemina, to Huroi, to the knights!&nbsp;</span><span style="">At a time when all of them were greatly mistaken about Grid, Grid was smiling with satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘With Euphemina’s skills, can’t she get rid of these knights at any time?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In fact, the reason Grid was so confident right now was because there was the existence called Euphemina.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had no doubts that Euphemina could handle all of them.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Thump, thump.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid kept moving forward, while the knights backing up became increasingly anxious.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then they reached the stairs leading up to the second floor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At this point, the knights made up their minds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What are we doing? We are honorable knights, so why are we scared of a person who escaped from jail? This is the shame of a lifetime!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This might cause harm to the lord. I have to defend this place, for the lord.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He isn’t a simple blacksmith if he managed to kill Leo. It is a matter of pride now. I won’t back up anymore.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Leo was alone, but there are four of us. We can’t lose.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The knights decided to no longer back off. This caused Grid to stop moving as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? Do you want to fight? Won’t you regret this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The knights gripped their swords and yelled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“We will fight! I can’t tolerate letting a criminal like you escape!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...I’m not a criminal. Crazy bastards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid became really irritated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the first place, wasn’t he unfairly framed?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Originally, he should’ve won the prize for winning the blacksmith game. Then he was taken to prison and unfairly suffered!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid angrily shouted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Euphemina! Show these guys! Use your magic. Take it away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina made a surprised expression.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Right now... it is a little... Can’t you handle it directly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? It is impossible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Stop joking. Can’t you beat them with your skills?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What are you saying? You should be the one fighting, not me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No, why are you refusing to fight now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid explained to Euphemina, "I can’t win against them.” </span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Don’t lie. You were able to get rid of the Northern Nova by yourself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No, that isn’t...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Somehow, the conversation was strange.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The faces of Grid and Euphemina gradually stiffened, while the knights completely lost their hesitation and attacked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Dammit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was like a teleportation move.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The knight Rupert used his patented ‘Dash’ skill and immediately reached Grid’s side, aiming a sword at him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was completely caught off guard and it seemed like he would be pierced by the sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Just before Rupert’s sword hit Grid, Huroi pushed him to the side and was stabbed instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"......!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Everyone thought that Huroi would die.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Huroi was already in a bad condition and he wasn’t wearing any armor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that moment, a strange thing happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this...? Urghh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rupert was astonished.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was because his sword, which should’ve pierced Huroi’s abdomen, was blocked by it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was like stabbing at steel. His wrist was broken.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, Huroi was fine.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The person who attacked was injured, while the person who was attacked was fine.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina asked with confusion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"What is with that guy? Why can’t the knight’s sword pierce him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid couldn’t reply.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Well... I don’t know...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why are you answering so half-heartedly? Why are you running around to save someone you don’t know? Stop joking around and just tell me the truth for once!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No... I really don’t know...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">High-level martial artists had a defense skill called Impenetrable Skin. But even Impenetrable Skin wasn’t able to block the sword of a knight with just the body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was clear that Huroi had some defensive ability that went beyond Impenetrable Skin.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi spoke during the silence.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I will tie up their feet. You two should use this gap to run away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reason why Huroi was able to block the knight’s attack with his body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was thanks to the skill given by the title ‘One who Overcomes Hardships.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Strong Will]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Resists any attack for 10 seconds after using the skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Mana Cost: 200</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 9,000 seconds&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The waiting time to reuse it was around 2.5 hours, but its performance was clearly great.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a priceless skill acquired after enduring and overcoming a hellish trial.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And Grid was the one who saved him from hell. Huroi already vowed to pay back this favor for the rest of my life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After that, Huroi determined that he would sacrifice himself for Grid. He wanted Grid to escape safely through the gap while the knights were unharmed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huroi...”&nbsp;</span><span style="">An ordinary person would hesitate to leave a fellow colleague but...&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Buy as much time as possible so that we can escape safely.” </span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I’ll see you next time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid and Euphemina weren’t emotional people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They immediately left this place and Huroi was left alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The knights tried to chase Grid but Huroi blocked the way.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He opened his mouth with an expression of determination to protect Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I have no thoughts of letting you leave, you #*&amp;!($#@. This damn <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1e3f5e">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>$#.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“......?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi was an orator so words that couldn’t be repeated emerged from his mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The knights suffered a profound psychological blow because of Huroi’s words, which were more abusive than anything they’ve heard before.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was Huroi’s Spiteful Tongue skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Huroi attacked the knights while they were confused and their stats were down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Unbreakable Justice!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was one of the two skills acquired from his second class, Apostle of Justice’s Partner.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was his ultimate attack skill that dealt damage that was 300% of his attack power.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">After Huroi’s fist struck Rupert’s face, the shock wave reached the knights standing around Rupert.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The sound of a huge blow echoed through the underground prison, causing the knights to reflexively scream in pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kkack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But it was just a reflexive reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The knights strangely couldn’t feel any pain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a natural phenomenon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the first place, an orator had poor physical abilities and he currently wasn’t equipped with any weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A 300% increase in an orator’s damage still wasn’t enough to deal a blow to armored knights. The difference was too big.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi accepted it calmly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“It is as I expected. This is a useless skill to the current me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It only took a few minutes for Huroi to be captured by the knights and locked in solitary confinement again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Huroi didn’t care.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He hadn’t been able to log out for 50 hours in reality. Therefore, he was exhausted and wanted to log out and rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Since the quest was clear, there was no penalty for logging out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Based on this situation, it will soon be over for Winston’s lord... I can easily escape from the prison after I get some sleep and log in again. Then Grid, I wish you good fortune.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">So, Huroi logged out.</span></p>
