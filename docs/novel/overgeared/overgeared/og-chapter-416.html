 <p><span style="">Chapter 416</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">There was nothing in front of strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was one of the truths of the game.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an undeniable law.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An extreme example of this law was applied in boss raids.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bosses that had millions of health?&nbsp;</span><span style="">If they suffered from tens of thousands of damage from dozens of players, they would eventually fall.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But what if the boss monster had the power to knock down the players in one go?&nbsp;</span><span style="">This truth was likely to be broken.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In that sense, it wasn’t impossible for Grid to wipe out 37 people from the allied teams alone.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">South Korea vs the allies.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Despite the efforts of Yura and Peak Sword, South Korea went increasingly on the defensive because the numerical disadvantage was too much.&nbsp;</span><span style="">All of the Korean players except for Yura and Peak Sword were logged out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the end for South Korea!&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moment that the people of the world were thinking the worst.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The protagonist appears.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After defeating Bondre and Bubat, Grid finally joined the battlefield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As always, he appeared with truly exquisite timing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Originally, the commentators and spectators would be thrilled to see him...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Grid’s outfit is really unique. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Um... It is vague. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The commentators and spectators were embarrassed as they saw Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Black armor and cloak, golden leggings and helmet, and red gauntlets.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s appearance was ridiculous after he wore different armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“He has no sense of aesthetics.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“How can he go around looking like that? Isn’t it embarrassing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"My daughter is in elementary school and she has a better grasp of colors than Grid...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If they looked at Grid’s armor individually, all the pieces were beautifully designed and nicely colored.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the harmony of colors together was a mess.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The black armor and red gauntlets were okay, but the armor was the same color as the cloak, as well as the leggings and helmet...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The combination didn’t look good.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a funny outfit that comedians would wear when they played punishment games.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid, what are you doing? Are you aiming to kill us with laughter?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“How thick is the sheet of iron in front of your face that you can go around like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I would rather be naked.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The momentum of the allied teams rose.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They laughed at Grid’s state and lost their tension.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the first place, Grid had wasted a lot of skills and mana while dealing with Bondre and Bubat, so the allied teams believed that they could easily kill Grid if they worked together.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But the result?&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were all wiped out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most of the team members had second advancement users and weren’t able to penetrate Grid’s defense. Meanwhile, Grid’s attack power shattered the defense of the allied teams.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid paid back every blow with 10 blows and slaughtered 37 people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hit, hit, hit, and hit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s simple battle strategy caused the enemies to feel an enormous fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If I can’t reproduce the strongest attack power because of the patch then I will show the strongest defense.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He didn’t keep this declaration.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unlike his declaration, he showed the strongest attack power and the strongest defense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was truly an overwhelming display of items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a show of hope for millions of people dreaming of being overgeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 A-Amazing... Amazing! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The current Grid can probably deal with two third advancement classes alone... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 At the end of Grid’s performance, the allied teams have been knocked out! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the moment when the commentators praised Grid for the annihilation of the allied teams.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal was sitting down and resting to recover from the powerful damage dealt by Pon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He watched the scoreboard with bloodshot eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">1st. South Korea - 83 points. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">2nd. United States - 68 points. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">3rd. Russia - 47 points. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">4th. Canada - 36 points. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaduduk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The allied teams, those guys were useless.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Not only did they not destroy the South Korean team, they couldn’t even stop South Korean from hitting the targets.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel saw that Korea was ahead and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I hoped that we could catch up while South Korea’s scoring was slowed down. Now that they can concentrate on the target processing, we’ll be forced to defend second place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What if we hit South Korea?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“We have a chance. South Korea is tired and we’re all strong, except for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel emphasized the ‘except for you’ part.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Zibal frowned at the words, causing Lauel to laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“But I can’t say how long it will take to defeat Grid. Currently, Grid has at least 3,100 defense and he seemed to have an extreme resistance to physical attacks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The average defense of the third advancement tankers was at least 2,500. Yet it was estimated that Grid had a defense that easily surpassed 3,000, despite being a blacksmith and not a tanker.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t even have any passive skills to increase his defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Damn items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal also had excellent items due to the 1st ranked blacksmith, Panmir. It was why he wasn’t killed by Pon’s Rail Spear. But somehow, it seemed shameful in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“If we fight Korea, we’ll be giving a chance to Russia and Canada. It’s better to be satisfied with second place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The top of the mountain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel handled the targets while looking down &nbsp;at the Russian team.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was honestly surprising. Despite Kraugel not being present, the six people were handling the targets quickly while confronting the Italian team.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The four third advancement class rankers have better skills than rumored. Is Kraugel raising their morale?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Sofia has been logged out! The Hungary team is eliminated! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...A monster.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After crossing the forest and mountains, Kraugel assassinated famous ranged damage dealers. His destructive power was beyond common sense. It was unrealistic. Lauel</span><span style="">&nbsp;questioned if even Grid could withstand Kraugel’s onslaught.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘...Wait.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Looking at the situation, Kraugel was the most active person on the battlefield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Maybe he was aiming for gold?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel had overlooked Russia’s power and realized it late.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If that’s the case...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel’s next target would be...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Yura of South Korea.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Would the biggest match of Grid vs Kraugel occur in the opening event?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Before being Lauel of Overgeared or Lauel of the United States, Lauel was a player of Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His honest desire as a pure player was to watch the confrontation between Grid and Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the common wish among the hundreds of millions of people watching the National competition.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Chinese and Japanese teams were facing each other on the lowest of the three mountains on Tira.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Both teams believed themselves to be Asia’s ambassadors, so they couldn’t focus on target processing because they were busy interfering with each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, there were three people who weren’t tense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were Japan’s Damian and Katz, and China’s Hao.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Indeed! Grid truly is great!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The strongest paladin who rose to become the first pope user was merely watching Grid’s activities and feeling admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Bah, how boring."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Katz.&nbsp;</span><span style="">One of Japan’s top rankers and an epic class user, he yawned without any hesitation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The sky above the sky...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The draconian and king of fighting was only conscious of Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Hey guys. What do we do now?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yoshimura, who was once called one of the best rankers in Japan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was strong against the weak and weak against the strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then Katz stepped forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Indeed, it’s less boring to kill these uncivilized bastards than to stay still.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The faces of the Chinese rankers reddened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? Uncivilized?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This nasty brat is speaking nonsense!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Chinese rankers were hot-blooded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Once Katz provoked them, the rankers rushed forward at once.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kukuk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Katz laughed and pulled out a sword from his waist.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the moment when the might of the Blood Warrior, which absorbed the enemy’s health with every attack and could use wide range skills using blood, was exposed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hao saw Katz’ strength instantly and finally came forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The struggle between the two Asian countries started in earnest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Chinese mainland and Japanese island simultaneously went wild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Damian’s remark poured cold water on them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Korea will be the best anyway.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the moment when the ‘Damian is Korean’ theory became stronger.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A 10 billion won neck.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tarma was part of a dark gamers group, Blood Carnival, which committed all types of bad acts.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He participated in the National Competition for Greece and his goal was to assassinate Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was involved in all possible events that Kraugel would participate in, and he would aim for Kraugel’s neck every time. He didn’t care about the gold medal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will gain additional benefits if I kill him three times in PvP... Killing other famous rankers will also gain me benefits. Kukuk, I will make hundreds of millions of won and migrate to the US.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He would enjoy a luxurious life in a mansion with beauties every day!&nbsp;</span><span style="">He dreamt of a brilliant future as he moved after Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then a golden hand hovered around him?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Grid’s famous God Hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is very irritating.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Armed with a sword, it was flying alone and handling the targets.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It didn’t care about what was happening in the surroundings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Tarma was afraid he might be spotted by Kruagel because of the God Hand, so he nervously hit the hand with a dagger.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The hand was hit hard and stiffened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He hit it hard enough for it to go flying, but it just stayed in place?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Go away!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Tarma scowled and hit the God Hand several more times.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then all of the scattered God Hands gathered and headed towards Tarma.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They recognized him as an enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They not only moved by themselves, but had the ability to make decisions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was a reason why Grid was famous for his items. Tarma</span><span style="">&nbsp;was feeling confused when he heard an unfamiliar voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What are you doing, assaulting someone else’s item?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid appeared in front of Tarma, who had promised to win against Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tarma snorted.</span></p>
