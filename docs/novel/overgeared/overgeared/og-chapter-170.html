 <p><span style="">Chapter 170</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The first day of the First Satisfy National Competition opened with the expectations of the world.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The crowd cheered as the boss raid and labyrinth breakthrough proceeded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was nothing unusual.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The United States, Canada and France were strong candidates for the championship. The three countries received medals.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, the 2nd ranked Zibal, the 3rd ranked Chris and the 8th ranked Bondre were remarkable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal participated in the boss raid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">He played the perfect role of a defender and led his team calmly, allowing the United States to be more stable and quicker at the raid than any other country.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, Bondre participated in the labyrinth breakthrough. He grasped the structure of the labyrinth quicker than anyone else and gave his country, France, a medal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Finally, Chris participated in both events.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As the leader of the largest guild, the Canadian had excellent leadership and succeeded in the boss raid after the United States.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He also broke through the labyrinth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Based on his overwhelming combat power, he was able to defeat other rankers and break through the labyrinth after Bondre.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As a result, the United States and France got one gold medal each. Canada had two silver medals.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Canadian people were frustrated by such results.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Players could only participate in a maximum of three events, so Canada was desperate at not winning a gold medal despite the fact that Chris, Canada’s strongest player, had already participated in two events.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the end, most people predicted that the two countries competing for the general championship would be the United States and France.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Today was the second day.&nbsp;</span><span style="">People were paying attention to two countries other than the United States and France.&nbsp;</span><span style="">South Korea and Brazil.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Who were the most beautiful women in the world?&nbsp;</span><span style="">If you asked any person, they would say two names.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura and Jishuka.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Billions of people anticipated their competition in today’s target processing match.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"A long description isn’t needed. Jishuka is the expert archer, expert archer. She is Satisfy’s best archer. Of course she will win the target processing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I think Yura will win. Yura’s ability to control magic power has always been well known. Her magic casting speed and accuracy are second to none. She has the ability to hit the targets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? There is a limitation that she must chant the spells in order to activate the magic. Arrows are much faster than magic. Jishuka’s arrows will penetrate all the targets before magic is cast.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hrmm, you don’t know. Don’t forget that the range of magic is much wider than arrows. While an arrow will penetrate through a few targets, Yura’s magic will destroy dozens of targets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura had maintained the 5th ranking since Satisfy opened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka started Satisfy half a year later than others but she was 13th on the unified rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In today’s target processing, they were the ones who would win gold and silver.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The hundreds of thousands of spectators and hundreds of millions of viewers around the world predicted so.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the opinions of the experts were different.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 It can’t be overlooked that 17 countries are participating in the National Competition. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Unless the players from other countries are stupid, they will focus on Yura and Jishuka. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Unfortunately, the target processing match isn’t a solo exhibition. It’s a contest of pairs. One person will focus on handling the targets, while the other one has to protect their teammate. But Korea and Brazil are countries weak in Satisfy, so they don’t have the capacity to protect Yura or Jishuka. Unfortunately, it’s painful, but they will certainly be excluded. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The rules for target processing were simple.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The S.A. Group designated nine uninhabited islands for the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Two representatives of each country would be placed on the uninhabited island called ‘Tira.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Each representative had to destroy small targets 5cm in diameter that were moving at a speed of 40m per second. Each target would give points, and the players themselves could be attacked and logged out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Destroying one target gave one point, and no additional points were gained by logging out another user.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The country that earned a total of 150 points first would win.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Before the event starts, let’s take a look at a map of Tira. The area is 67.21km, slightly smaller than Ulleungdo, and there are two mountains standing 589m high in the centre of the island. The island is made up of dense forests, and there are areas where monsters spawn and deep cliffs, so the participants need to be careful. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Is there a point where the targets are? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 No. There are a total of 1,500 targets distributed evenly throughout the island, and they continue to move. The targets are small, fast and have various movement patterns, so it is very difficult to destroy them while the enemies are interfering. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 I heard that the colors of the targets vary. Are all points equal, regardless of the color? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 That’s right. But there is one exception. It’s the gold target. Unlike the other targets, destroying the gold target will give the player 50 points. Therefore, the gold target is what we should pay attention to in this competition. It is an important target that will help a team win. However, it moves 10 times faster than normal targets... It will be very difficult to shoot at it. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 10 times faster is 400m per second? Isn’t that similar to the speed of a bullet fired by a pistol? How can it be destroyed? Since the targets have 100% resistance to status conditions, isn’t it impossible to restrain the targets’ movements with magic? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 A target that is smaller than a human and faster than bullets. It’s impossible in reality, although Satisfy is different. Isn’t Satisfy an impossible world? Maybe Jishuka can easily handle the gold target? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 As we are speaking, the players are entering. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Seoul Olympic Stadium.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The hundreds of thousands of spectators welcomed the 33 participants who headed to the capsule room in the middle of the stadium.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were 33 people, not 34.&nbsp;</span><span style="">All the countries had two people participating, except for South Korea, who only had Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The crowd belatedly realized the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? Yura doesn’t have a partner?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Won’t she be at a disadvantage if she joins alone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh! South Korea! What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“South Korea must be crazy! Are you going to bully Goddess Yura now? Huh? You deserve a scolding!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was booing from the stands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Inside the capsule room.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The players started laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“South Korea has no one except for Yura. The second person who would participate would just be trash, so Yura has probably given up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I feel sorry for her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"In the first place, it is just significant that South Korea managed to participate in this National Competition. To be honest, it was almost a miracle that South Korea was able to put its name on the list of participating counties. They should be satisfied with just that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Indeed... South Korea doesn’t have anyone except for Yura and Peak Sword. Peak Sword isn’t even participating in this competition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It is funny. How was South Korea able to participate in the National Competition? Wouldn’t it be difficult for them to do well in the selection quests?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The host country is South Korea and S.A. is a Korean company. There was probably some manipulation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Maybe Yura entertained them? Kilkil.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Everyone was gossiping and murmuring.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Yura had a unconcerned expression on her face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She prepared to enter the capsule without caring about anyone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A British representative approached her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Regas.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was unable to hide his uncomfortable tone as he asked Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Miss Yura, why are you participating alone? It would’ve been hard originally, but now that you’re fighting alone? Surely you aren’t giving up on the competition like everyone else said?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas had moderately accurate Korean pronunciation. He had studied hard to learn Korean. But there was a sense of stiffness.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In order to ease his efforts, Yura replied in fluent English.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I don’t know the words ‘giving up.’ It might be hard when fighting alone, but I will surely win. So don’t worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura was beautiful and 5th on the unified rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was a remarkable commodity.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most of Satisfy’s rankers had been exposed to the media.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the first time they met directly, but Regas had seen interviews of her and knew her personality.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You mean it. You really plan to win by yourself? But is it possible? I don’t understand why you are playing alone without a partner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"My partner can’t be contacted.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Partner...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was this?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Her teammate...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A representative couldn’t be contacted? They were the worst.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The angry Regas turned his gaze to the capsule next to Yura’s capsule. Then he was surprised to see the participant ID on the badge attached to the capsule.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Grid? Grid was supposed to be the one to participate in the target processing with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid-ssi didn’t agree. I registered him as a participant without telling him. I don’t blame him if he doesn’t come. Rather, Grid will probably grumble since I acted arbitrarily.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Does Yura know Grid’s identity? So she wanted to depend on Grid?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Certainly, South Korea would get a high ranking if Grid participated in the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was regrettable.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Regas was a fellow guild member, so he knew that Grid wasn’t willing to participate in the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...It will be a struggle. The British team won’t attack the lone Korean team.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas said with a grim expression on his face, while Yura sent him a taunting smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You might get hurt if you ignore a lone woman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was truly the confidence of a top 5 player.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Regas reminded himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘That’s right. There is no weak person here.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Everyone who participated in the National Competition... There might be gaps between them, but they were excellent representatives of each country.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Regas was reminded of that thanks to Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was delighted to be able to compete with the strongest players.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Meanwhile, Jishuka was pouting over at the Brazilian team.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What? Grid isn’t coming?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a large shock when Grid ignored her whispers in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, she didn’t despair because of her strong mental state.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She grasped all the events that Grid was signed up to in the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She was looking forward to seeing him in the target processing event.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She hoped she could meet Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But in the end, Grid didn’t come.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her disappointment couldn’t be hidden.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Really... I can’t meet him despite being in South Korea?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the first time she was interested in the opposite sex.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She wanted to see his face, but it was too hard.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It seemed too much when she was a star.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I am angry.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">But she needed to separate her priorities.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She calmed down and ordered her partner, Samuel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"We will enter the forest as soon as we log into the game.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Samuel had the strongest fighting power among the remaining Brazilian users, but his overall ranking was very low. Samuel questioned her. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">“As an archer, isn’t it better for you to occupy the top of a mountain? Isn’t it easier to snipe the enemies from a high place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"On the contrary, it is easier to become a target. It isn’t just one team participating, but 17. We’ll be attacked if we stand out in the beginning. Let’s hide as much as possible until the enemies are annihilated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Indeed...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka was the leader of the Tzedakah Guild, a strong group in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was much smarter than Samuel, so he vowed to always obey her orders.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then all the players entered their capsules.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The large screens installed all around the stadium started to show Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">33 players appeared on the small but lushly forested island of Tira.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were logged in at regular intervals, so they could move quickly to secure their safety.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most teams ran to occupy the top of the mountains, but some teams were hiding in the forest like the Brazilian team.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then Yura aimed at magic spell at the small targets flying around in the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dark Storm.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was truly an overwhelming sight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">One-fifth of the forest that made up the island was swept away by the storm and completely destroyed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The commentators shouted in a trembling voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The South Korean team has acquired 28 points! The Italian team has been logged out! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The crowd was shocked and fell silent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The players participating in the game were also confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? Why are the Italian people dead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“They seem to have fallen off a cliff because of the storm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s crazy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Wow, look at the forest. What type of magic is that? How high is her magic power?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Indeed... It’s true that she’s the Eighth Servant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 5th place on the unified rankings was a special place.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Since Satisfy opened, many rankers tried their best, but the 5th rank never changed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because the wall of Yura blocking them was too high and solid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The 5th place wall was insurmountable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">When they actually faced her, it was really great.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But they weren’t afraid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘We are also strong.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Right now, she was just a lamp in front of the wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The waiting room of the United States team. Zibal</span><span style="">&nbsp;smiled as he watched the live relay on the monitors.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“She is choosing a quick victory. Indeed, she’s a girl that I acknowledge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the first place, she was outnumbered. If they enemies allied together and dragged out the time, Yura would be helpless.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She planned to win before the other teams could block her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She judged that it was wiser to move fast and hit hard.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“But Yura. You would do well not to ignore the participants. Everyone is wise and strong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal was sure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura would soon meet her end.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was her limit, despite her 5th rank.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The sound of the shouts are amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo arrived at the entrance to the stadium.</span></p>
