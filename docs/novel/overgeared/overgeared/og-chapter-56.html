 <p><span style="">Chapter 56</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>

 <p><span style=""> "I don’t know. I only met her when we competed in the game, so how could I know so much about her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Didn’t you team up with your successor and participated in the fight? He also didn’t notice anything about Erina?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">These guys couldn’t even guess that I was Khan’s successor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Maybe it was because I looked like a beginner, as no one would think that the successor of the prestigious blacksmith Khan would be a beginner.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Sheesh.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Whether it was because they were irritated at not gaining anything, or because he was an NPC, the men left without saying goodbye to Khan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I pulled out salt from my inventory and sprinkled it in front of the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Phew, unlucky bastards. Don’t come back again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan scratched his head as he looked at me.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Shouldn’t you be sprinkling coarse salt?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Ah, is that so? Hum hum, let’s go back to work.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As I turned back to the furnace, Khan opened his mouth and asked,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Are you going to work today without resting?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The more I look, the more I feel admiration. You already have excellent skills, but you aren’t satisfied and you keep working hard...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Excellent skills...&nbsp;</span><span style="">If my skills were really excellent, I would’ve created a unique and legendary rated item among the 73 items that I made.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But not only did a unique rating not emerge, I only made three epic rated items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was still lacking. I needed to raise my skill level further.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I would make a lot of money and show my parents.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I need to be quickly recognized by my parents...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The fact that I had less time to play the game was a big problem.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">As I concentrated on making the items, Khan sat at the counter and sold the items I made to the customers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a very desirable system; other users would go green in envy if they saw this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why?&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were three ways that ordinary users could sell items to other users:</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Firstly - they could open up a street stall and sell them to users directly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Secondly - they could sell items at the auction site.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thirdly, they could post the items to be sold on a cash transaction site.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the first case, a lot of time could be wasted waiting for customers to come. In addition, bargaining with the customers was frequent and could be stressful.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The second and third options saved time but there were high fees involved.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In other words, it meant that a normal user had to take time and money to sell the items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But I was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan sold the items on my behalf, saving me time. He also didn’t charge me a sales commission.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I just needed to make the items, while Khan sold them and gave the proceeds back to me.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If I steadily made money by producing more than two items a day, I would surely become rich someday...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...I’m still waiting! This is rotten. No, shit. Does this make sense? I am a legendary class so why can’t I make a legendary item?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On that day, the S.A. Group Headquater’s operations team received an email.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Title: Look and you will see.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Contents: If you look at my information, you can see that I’m a legendary blacksmith. So why can’t I make any legendary items? If I am a legendary blacksmith, isn’t it normal for me to be able to make a legendary item? No, I didn’t do anything else for a month and made 73 items, but there were no legendary items at all. Yes? I didn’t create a single unique item and only made three epic items, so isn’t this manipulation? Yes? You are probably manipulating this right? Huh? Right? Ah, look. This is really X. Do you want me to snap? Should I go there? Eh? The materials and production method are good, so isn’t this manipulation, you &nbsp;#<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="aed08f8aee80">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The employee who checked the email thought it was absurd.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What manipulation... First he should raise the level...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level 10 users and level 100 users.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Assuming that both of them had the same dexterity stat and skill level, a level 100 user was more likely to produce a higher rated item than the level 10 user.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In other words, the higher the level of the maker, the better the item. This was common sense among users with production classes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, this wasn’t known by the user who obtained a legendary class.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The employees sighed as a group.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It is painful to see that great class...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then someone said.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"If the contents of the email aren’t false, he really is an unlucky person. With the Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill, he only made 3 epic items out of 73? Unique and legendary items are unlikely because their probabilities are low, but there is a fixed probability of creating an epic item. Looking at this, doesn’t he really seem cursed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">All the employees were sympathetic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“He really is a person with bad luck...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No wonder why he feels doubts about manipulation...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“If it is really possible to intervene, I would like to increase his chances of making higher rated items.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">From that day onwards, Grid became famous for his bad luck among the game operators.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">&nbsp;The 73 items I made were weapons and armor with a level 60 limit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The total sales amount was 1,590 gold, with a net profit of 1,079 gold.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was equivalent to exactly 1,294,800 won when converted to cash.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The game, which I played for 5~6 hours a day, earned me around 1.3 million won a month. If I quit going to the labor office, I would be able to make three times as much money.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In addition, if I was fortunate enough to make a unique or legendary item, I could earn tens of millions of won.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, my parents didn’t agree, as they knew that the number of people who made money from the game was very low.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Furthermore, I had been playing for over a year, and yet I still couldn’t escape my debt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right. In society and in my home, I was treated as someone with bad credit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">My parents overlapped with the first and second financial institutions that rejected me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Should I sell the Ideal Dagger? No, no. It isn’t time yet.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I could sell the Ideal Dagger as a means of proving to my parents that I could make money through Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But I couldn’t sell the Ideal Dagger. The reason for this was the terms of use for the Ideal Dagger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In order to meet the Ideal Dagger’s usage conditions, the passive skill called Advanced Dagger Mastery was needed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But at the moment, the top rankers of each class only had intermediate level skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If I put up the Ideal Dagger on the trading site in this situation, only the merchants thinking of future profits would flock to it. Therefore, the merchants were likely to bid at the cheapest price possible and it was likely that the dagger would be sold at an unsatisfactory price.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I had to hold onto the Ideal Dagger for the moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was four in the morning.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I reached the end of my limit at the thought of going to the labor office.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Do I have to live like this forever...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Four in the morning was when most people would still be dreaming.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But I had to work until 6 p.m. just for 90,000 won per day, while my body suffered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I could endure it if it was my only way of making money like before, but now it was different!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was able to make more money from playing the game than doing labor work, so going to the labor office was just a waste of time!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Shit...I want a unique or legendary item. Or if I make a lot of epic items, it will help persuade my parents that I am making a profit... Urgh, dammit. I feel angry as soon as I open my eyes. It can't be helped. I should get some cold air. Huh? This...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As I was exiting my front door to go on a walk around the neighborhood, I saw a flyer sticking out from the newspaper.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[September 10th! The long-awaited opening!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The best capsule room is open!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There are 150 top of the line capsules!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It is fully equipped with cafe facilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Delicious food cooked by a 5 star hotel chef.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A feast of beauties and handsome workers!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Please don’t ask for the employee’ telephone numbers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On September 10th, for just one day! Any customers who sign up will receive a 30% discount on the capsule room fee for a lifetime!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Heok... a lifetime discount on a capsule room?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The capsule room was 6,000 won per hour. If it was a 30% discount...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is it!”&nbsp;</span><span style="">I got a good idea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I headed back to my room. I changed into my work clothes and opened the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh? Your work clothes? Are you going to work already? Isn’t it only 4.10 a.m?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">My puzzled mother asked and I vigorously nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right! I am going work! Hahahahaha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"... Why are you so full of energy in the morning?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Puhahaha! Of course! I am young and overflowing with energy. Then Mother, Father! I will go to work early this time! Puhahahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Youngwoo, are you sick or something...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes... I am worried...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I left the house while my parents felt worried.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Today was September 10th!&nbsp;</span><span style="">I looked for the newly opened capsule room.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The colorful banners hung outside a building to announce the opening of the capsule room.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This will be my job starting from today. Puhahahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yes, I was going to quit the labor jobs today.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now I would play Satisfy from the moment I got up to when I fell asleep.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I would spend the morning and afternoon in the capsule room. Then I would play at home at night.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Now I can work harder to make items. Puhahahat!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Recently, Khan’s smithy was a great source of interest for users.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Among the items sold at Khan’s smithy, there were level 60 equipment made by a craftsman with great talent and potential, but lacking in experience and reputation. His equipment had an almost 20% better performance than normal items. Even the normal rated items were comparable to rare rated equipment at the same level.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The users called this the ‘Unknown Craftsman Series’ and it was very popular.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The performance was good but the price was rather expensive. However, money wasn’t a problem. They couldn’t live without this equipment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The users entered Khan’s smithy on a daily basis.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Did the unknown craftsman make any more items?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will buy any items he made! I will pay however much you want, so please sell it to me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Give me his name. I personally want to ask him to make me an item. Yes? Where can I meet him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The users wanted to have items made by the unknown craftsman, or they were curious about his identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Khan never replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid always made a limited number of items due to time restrictions, and he didn’t want others to know his identity.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The crowd at the counter never imagined that the beginner user hammering at the furnace behind Khan would be the one they were looking for.</span></p>
