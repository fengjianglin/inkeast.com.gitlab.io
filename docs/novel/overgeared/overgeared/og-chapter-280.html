 <p><span style="">Chapter 280</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kukwakwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was like being hit by a tsunami of black energy blades.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The elders’ meeting room was turned into ruins in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Enormous damage!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal and the elders thought.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The prostitutes shaking in the corner were protected by Lifael’s Spear, but the elders only had each other to rely on..</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Holy Shield!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Resist the Dark!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal and the others increased their physical and black magic resistance before using heals on each other.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was no room to worry about mana.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their top priority was enduring and surviving the aggressive attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The paladins will rush over when the turmoil grows! Buy time until then!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Don’t stop healing!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Flash!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The green light restoring their wounds and health shone without rest. It was like looking at an aurora.&nbsp;</span><span style="">These were heals used by the highest ranked priests of the Rebecca Church.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It could even endure a dragon’s breath for a while.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the current reality was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'The amount of recovery can’t keep up with the damage!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This isn’t a destructive power that humans can exert! Grid is surely a demonkin!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The +9 Failure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a weapon that had an attack power comparable to the Rebecca Church’s three divine artefacts.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The +8 Doppelganger’s Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The attack power couldn’t be fully exerted thanks to the penalty, but it had the option to increase the damage of skills by 20%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The power of the legendary skills used by these two swords was more than imagined.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 23 elders had an average level of 300.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Among them, seven were still second advancement priests with a level of 290.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were the ones severely injured.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Black magic was the antithesis of divine power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘These people are the hole.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The seven elders were torn into rags.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s red light detected their weaknesses.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have to finish it as quickly as possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The duration of Blackening was only five minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he didn’t win in five minutes, he wouldn’t be able to cope with the resilience of Pascal and the elders’ heals.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Blacksmith's Rage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Attack power will increase by 25% and attack speed will increase by 40%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Blacksmith's Rage was now level 4, so the duration was longer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">35 seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a golden opportunity for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">He leapt over the crushed round table.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He moved carefully so that the prostitutes wouldn’t be harmed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Link.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pit!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pipipipipit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Several dozens of black energy swords were drawn around the seven elders as Grid narrowed the distance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Afterimages were formed because of his quick speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The elders didn’t even notice that they were cut.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puhahak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">They were bewildered for a moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Blood simultaneously poured from the bodies of the seven elders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hueok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“H-Help me...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Those struck didn’t even know it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">How creepy was this?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The terrified elders used Heal. However, Grid’s attack speed was much faster than the casting speed of Heal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the first place, they shouldn’t have allowed him to get close.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kyaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The ‘5 Joint Attacks’ attached to the Holy Light Gloves and the ‘Bisect’ skill attached to Failure turned the elders to grey ash.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have defeated the corrupt elder Huda.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[12,910,300 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Advanced priest’s clothing has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A high quality emerald ring has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have killed a human in the half demon state, so demonic magic power has increased by 10.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have defeated the corrupt elder Furell.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[12,552,000 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Advanced priest’s shoes have been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have killed a human in the half demon...]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The notification windows after killing the seven second advancement elders came to a halt in Grid’s sight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The dropped items weren’t anything special, but the experience was significant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the fact that demonic power increased by 10 points made Grid uneasy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The increase in demonic power made it possible for him to go to hell, but was that really all?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Perhaps he might change species into a demon.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A green light hit Grid while he was filled with anxiety.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a Heal from Pascal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had aimed it perfectly after Grid took care of the seven elders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have been affected by Great Heal.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Holy Light Armor raises the recovery magic’s power by 300%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Great Heal is a deadly poison to a half demon!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 23,640 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Holy Light Armor gave Grid absolute power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That strongest armor was now his weakness.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s health gauge fell by two-thirds in a single blow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pascal identified Grid’s pain and was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What? It was more effective than expected?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pascal didn’t know the exact reason, but he interpreted it in his own way.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The goddess is blessing me!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">For sure! Goddess Rebecca was hoping for Grid’s death!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pascal was convinced by this and his momentum rose.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Now! Pour out your heals towards him! Give the goddess’ punishment to that wicked demon, who is trying to deceive everyone!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Flash!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">All of the survive 16 priests were third advancement priests.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The power of the Great Heals they used was different from the seven elders who died earlier.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">16 rays of green light hit Grid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">At first, Grid tried to avoid it, but he stopped in place as soon as one attack was allowed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was caught by the light and hit by multiple healing magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pascal and the elders smiled with satisfaction at the sight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Surprisingly easy!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'He sold his soul to the demons!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid is killed!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment that Pascal and the elders were convinced of their victory.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rather than dying within the light, Grid started moving again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid approached the astonished Pascal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was really a tremendous speed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was due to Quick Movements that was attached to the +8 Ideal Dagger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A blue light shot in a straight line.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal’s Holy Divine Shield was crushed in a single blow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was despite the fact that it was three times more powerful than a typical Holy Shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Y-You! Why are you alive?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s status wasn’t fine either.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was deeply wounded everywhere and shedding blood.. There was a hole in the vicinity of his chest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wouldn’t be strange if he died.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid had a passive skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A legend doesn’t die easily. You can resist all attacks for 5 seconds with a minimum of health.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had long been dependent on the invincible skill, and he was now enraged.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Rotten bastards! How can multiple people attack one person?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What now...? Aren’t you the one who came to attack all of us alone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal felt that Grid was ridiculous as he used Heal on himself. At the same time, his Holy Divine Shield was restored. It was double casting.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid didn’t stay still.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Evil Spirit’s Bloody Tears had been activated and his attack power increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After using Wave to slow down Pascal and the elders’ speed, he was able to link Unbreakable Justice with no time difference, not giving Pascal the chance to complete the shield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he used his strongest skill straight away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Linked Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">One blow to Pascal’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The second blow.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puoook!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The third blow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Two greatswords stabbed at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid smacked his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I would’ve been able to kill him if there were two more blows.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The number of strikes that Linked Kill dealt was random. It couldn’t be intentionally controlled. It was unfortunate.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pascal was struck in the heart and suffering from terrible pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Y-You cruel bastard...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid hadn’t once frowned while persistently aiming at the heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now he looked like he found this delicious, so he certainly wasn’t normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What right do you have to denounce and punish me, when you are just as cruel?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal cried out to Grid with an unfair expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The right of the strong."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was enough.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pascal had trampled on many weak people just because he was strong.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now he was reaping what he sowed. Pascal felt like he had been hit in the back of the head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were no apparent objections, so Grid wielded Failure successively.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The elders used Heal to save Pascal, but it wasn’t enough.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pascal was directly hit by Linked Kill and lost almost all his health. Demonic power also infiltrated his body, so Heal couldn’t have a proper effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This guy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The veins bulged on the balding Pascal’s head and his eyes became red and bloodshot.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In one month!&nbsp;</span><span style="">In one month, he would’ve become pope and reigned over 80 million people!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why did you appear before me...? Youuu! Kuaaaaak! I won’t die alone! Light Blaze!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal was level 330.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His divine power was lower than former Pope Drevigo, but his level was much higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Named NPCs grew in proportion to the average level of the users.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The magic that he used couldn’t be ignored.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal caused a divine explosion, firing dozens of magic power rays at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It isn’t a big deal!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were still two seconds left on the invincible duration.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid attacked without fleeing from the magic power rays.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Crazy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal couldn’t understand the situation at all.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He meant for both of them to die, so why didn’t this person lose momentum?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Even if you are a zombie, you won’t be able to survive this! Goddess’ Wrath!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal had no place to retreat anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He depleted all of his divine power and health to cast this spell.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was his final decision to end Grid who ruined his life.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Papat!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pa pa pa pat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Two large gold circles, approximately 3m in diameter, were quickly created behind Pascal’s back.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the magic spell that Pope Drevigo used in the past.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The size of the magic circles was much smaller than when Drevigo used it, since he was lacking divine power. However, it was still enough power against the current Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuwaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A brilliant flash of light was emitted from the circles.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The whole room shook and cracked in the aftermath.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the goddess’ magic that surpassed Transcended Link in terms of power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As the light shot at him, notification windows appeared in Grid’s vision.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The duration of Invicible is over.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Would he die?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The strength of Pascal with the healing shuttles called the elders was beyond Grid’s expectations.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the result wouldn’t change.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid knew it from the beginning.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will win.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It had been a year and three months since the fall of Pope Drevigo.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the meantime, Grid had made considerable progress.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Regardless of the variables, it was impossible for Grid to be defeated by Pascal, who was on the same level as Drevigo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Freely Move!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the skill attached to the title ‘Secret Hero.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were limits to the range of use, and the cooldown time was one hour.However, it was a top dashing skill that allowed him to avoid all non-targeting skills until he reached his target.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid rushed towards Pascal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He turned in the air and avoided two flashes of light from Goddess’ Wrath.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">His raging demonic power concentrated on Failure and the Doppelganger’s Greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is ridiculous!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His magic couldn’t hit the target in front of it?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The greatswords fell towards the astonished Pascal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pinnacle!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The level of Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Pinnacle has increased.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The amount of damage done to the target and the mana consumption will increase.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk...! Kuaaaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal screamed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The elders determined they couldn’t save him and used Heal against Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Flash!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was immediately after Invincible and Freely Move ran out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He only had one health left and 16 rays of green light were aiming at the unprotected Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Would he die now?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was no longer the helpless person who tasted countless deaths.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was careful and clever... No, it was common sense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was easy to calculate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Dark Bus’ Earrings have been turned off.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The effect of Blackening will disappear.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have been affected by Great Heal.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Holy Light Armor raises the recovery magic’s power by 300%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your health has been restored.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your health has been restored.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your health...]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Shortly before dying.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pascal was happy at the thought of having Grid as a companion on his journey of death, only for his expression to twist.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was close to death, only to be restored by the elders’ Heal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is crazy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was Pascal’s last call before he turned to ash.</span></p>
