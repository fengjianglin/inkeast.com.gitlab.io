 <p><span style="">Chapter 148</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">By the end of February.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The spring vacation of the Young Ladies High School was also ending.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sehee’s new semester of her second year in high school would start in a few days, so she was studying hard today.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hobbies? Travel? Dating?&nbsp;</span><span style="">She had no interest at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">She simply enjoyed leisurely activities like jogging in the morning and yoga in the evening. Even that was just to maintain her condition for studying.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee only devoted herself to studying.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why was she so obsessed with studying?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was because of her brother, Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Her brother didn’t have any talent in studying and he didn’t stand out in any particular field. His only advantage was his patience, but after he went to university, she became worried about his future because he became lazy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She expected him to improve after going to the army, but he actually worsened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rather than going back to study, he fell into a game called Satisfy and got into debt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their parents were worried. The two of them sighed because her brother’s future was becoming dimmer every day.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have to take care of Oppa.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was it because she grew up watching her pitiful and useless brother?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sehee grew up at an early age because of her brother.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In middle school, she became determined to look after her parents and brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I’ll study hard on behalf of Oppa. I will succeed and become responsible for my parents and Oppa.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Unlike her brother, Sehee was talented. She was a good student, went to the prestigious Young Ladies High School and had top grades in the nation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her ultimate goal was simple.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She planned to graduate from the best university, get a good job, earn a high salary, and support her parents and brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Oppa can believe in me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She continued studying while thinking so.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, a problem occurred not long ago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her brother changed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her brother suddenly become economically self-sustaining in a certain area.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right, it was Satisfy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Ironically, it was the game that ate some of her brother’s youth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her brother succeeded in the game and cleared his debt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He repaid not only his debt, but their father’s debt as well. Then he gave their parents hundreds of millions of allowance for their comfort.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One day, her brother said to her,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"In one year, I will buy a 10 billion won building. We can rent it out and our family can live happily for the rest of our lives.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee was proud of her brother who succeeded in changing. She was delighted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, she was also worried.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It isn’t a bluff...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had the ability to afford it, but her brother had bought a 800 million won foreign car as soon as he made money.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She knew that rich people often lost their wealth due to a lack of economic sense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sehee was worried that her brother would quickly lose his wealth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In addition, she was also concerned about his relationship with girls.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If he is too ostentatious...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were many women who would be attracted to a man driving a 800 million won foreign car.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But wasn’t her brother someone with no dating experience?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would be easy to fool.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sigh... I would feel more comfortable if I am with Oppa.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She wanted to watch over her brother 24 hours a day.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sehee had an unusual obsession with her brother, probably because she had been taking responsibility for him for several years already.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She was sitting at her desk when she turned her gaze towards the window.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was noisy outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is it a celebrity?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Men, women and children were making a fuss on the street.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sehee approached the window to see what the fuss was about.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then she frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Why is she here...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She had a bad feeling.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">000-0 Street, XX Neighbourhood, Geumcheon-gu.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The neighbourhood consisted of ordinary people, but it had been noisy lately.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because an expensive foreign car appeared in front of the Shin house, whose occupants operated a vegetable store.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The residents of the area were interested in the car and examined it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That is the 13th model from B Company. It is 800 million won.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Wow, I’m shaking. Shin ahjussi, did he sell a lot of cabbages? How did he afford this car?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It looks like his son is driving it, not Shin ahjussi...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh? Doesn’t he usually dress in sweats like an unemployed bum? Where did he get the money to drive a car like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“He must’ve won the lotto.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kung... He paid off his debt and bought a car like that, I think he really did win the lotto.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I won’t be able to afford it even if I die working~ Life is unfair.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Well... I buy five lotto tickets every week, but I never win... Perhaps I should buy 10 tickets every week.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The weekend.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The residents were walking in front of the Shin family’s house.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were many people enjoying the spring weather, and they continued commenting on Youngwoo’s car.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then a vehicle entered the neighborhood.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The eyes of the residents’ widened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a large limousine that was 8.5m long.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The ordinary people stared as the gorgeous white car stopped in front of the Shin house.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the moment when the locals forgot about B Company’s 13 series.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Clink.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Three burly men descended from the vehicle. Two of them looked around, while the other one ran to the back seat and opened the door.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then a woman appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The woman boasted such overwhelming beauty that the flowers lining the street faded at once.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was like she was the only thing shining in the world.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The scenery seemed grey beside her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That woman?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The residents captivated by her unrealistic beauty belatedly realized her identity.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was Yura, who was praised as the ‘Jewel of South Korea.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A frenzy occurred.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow! I can’t believe it! Yura! Yura!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yura unni! Please sign this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A photo! Can I have a photo?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yura! Will you marry me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ahh... I never thought the day would come when I can see Yura in real life... I don’t care if I die right now...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“She is even prettier than her photos. Truly a goddess.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the level of a riot.&nbsp;</span><span style="">People started to rapidly gather after hearing the noise.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the three bodyguards that came with Yura were the aces of the industry. They efficiently occupied the space, allowing three people to control dozens of people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to this, Yura was able to ring the doorbell of the Shin home without being disturbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok... Why is Yura at the Shin house?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“D-Don’t tell me...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The people’s imaginations ran wild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Shin family’s unemployed son!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Could he have a special relationship with Yura?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was it due to Yura’s financial power that the Shin family’s useless son could drive an expensive car?&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were all types of speculation, but it didn’t last long.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yura wouldn’t like such an ugly person...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Of course. If Shin-ssi’s son and Yura were on an uninhabited island alone, Yura still won’t look at Shin-ssi’s son.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Then what is Yura doing at the Shin house?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The gates of the Shin house opened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What are you doing at my house?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An irritated voice was heard.&nbsp;</span><span style="">People’s eyes focused on the owner of the voice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the Shin family’s daughter.&nbsp;</span><span style="">People admired her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow... She’s acting like that towards Yura.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That... Even entertainers on TV seem ugly next to Yura...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The two people look like a picture.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Maybe Yura is here to see her. Is it strange for beautiful people to hang out together?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No one was thinking calmly. They were half out of their mind as they spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Noisy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They attempted to take photos.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sehee felt burdened and brought Yura into the house.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Come in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Thank you."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Now, what is your purpose for coming here?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sehee asked with curiosity as she locked the gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura looked at the small garden planted with camellias and replied with a smile. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I came to see Youngwoo-ssi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee didn’t feel good. She didn’t hide her hostility.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why is a great person like you trying to meet Oppa? In the first place, how do you know him? What is your relationship?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura was a genius.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But that didn’t apply to relationships.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She responded without realizing the meaning behind Sehee’s questions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I met Youngwoo-ssi while playing Satisfy. I got friendly with him while playing lovers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Playing lovers?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It was a very short, but fun game.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee no longer heard Yura’s voice. Only the word ‘lovers’ went through her mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Oppa said he was playing hard to make money, but he is actually flirting inside a game? I have been busy studying for his sake and never even held a man’s hand.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee’s complexion changed. She was so irritated that tears filled her eyes.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">"I originally planned to enhance Failure and my armor but...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid knew what he had to do.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had no intention of relying on his existing items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He learned from the Awakened Guardian of the Forest that his defense wasn’t sufficient, even if he was wearing a legendary armor set.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was planning to use his class effect of ‘increased probability of item enhancement’ in order to strengthen Failure and his armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I want to use these items for as long as possible... Even if it costs a lot of money, it’s better to take the risk. I have to buy all the enhancement stones in the auction house.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But before that, he needed to make Vantner’s armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I can’t postpone it any longer...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to his quest, the marriage ceremony, and the Guardian of the Forest raid, the armor had been delayed for nearly two months.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid didn’t have the heart to delay it any longer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He looked at the method to make the Wave Armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Good good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Wave Armor was indeed a great item.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, the first option gave an excellent defense effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'It’s less than the Holy Light Armor.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The default defense of the Holy Light Armor was better than Wave Armor. The Holy Light Armor also reduced physical damage by 40% and magic damage by 50%.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Considering the other options and set item effects, the Holy Light Armor was actually a few times better than the Wave Armor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the Holy Light Armor was limited to ‘Franz,’ so it was like an exclusive item for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If I want to sell armor, the Wave Armor is better.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Once all the guild members had their items, he would produce a large amount of Wave Armor and sell them to rankers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was excited about acquiring the Wave Armor production method for free.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The hammering sound was light.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was enthusiastic about producing it and worked with a high degree of concentration.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After approximately three hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner came looking for him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid felt his presence but kept hammering.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What, Mister? Didn’t you say you were going to pray?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner scratched his head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I want to watch my armor being finished... Heheh, is it okay if I watch?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner had been waiting for almost two months, so he was very excited.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid understood Vantner’s anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s fine if you are quiet. Sit over there and watch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Thank you. I’ll be praying to the gods that it’s a legendary item.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner fell to his knees. Then he joined both hands together and really started to pray.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It reminded Grid of Cassus when he made the Divine Shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The Vatican is stable...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was no news that a new pope had been elected.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Didn’t I forget to seal Isabel’s spear? Perhaps Isabel will die and it’s my fault? I’m sorry... Well, one day she will come for it to be sealed.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid started concentrating on hammering again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The tempered black iron and mithril steel plates on the anvil were gradually assembled in the shape of armor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Vantner’s excitement soared as he prayed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Please...! Please let it be finished with a legendary rating...! I’m praying to all the gods in the world! Please please please let it be a legendary rating!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As his prayer was reaching its peak...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This... My sister is calling.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then Grid’s hammering suddenly stopped?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh? What?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner was confused as he failed to identify the new situation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid put his hammer and the armor he was making back into his inventory.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I'm sorry. My sister is calling me, so I have to go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid thought it sounded urgent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner doubted his ears. He thought Grid was playing around.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it wasn’t a joke.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The guild member ‘Grid’ has closed his connection.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid disappeared from in front of him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Vantner stared at the flames in the furnace for a long time before screaming.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You bastard! You are deliberately playing with meeee!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It’s noisy, so get out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ugh... Uwaaaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner was kicked out by Khan and ran to the hunting grounds. Then he swung his axes at monsters while thinking about Grid.</span></p>
