 <p><span style="">Chapter 311</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p><span style="">'Naive... No, a fool. Learn how to be more suspicious and vigilant.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham had no intention of taking Grid’s body from the beginning.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He needed to be resurrected in his own body, not somebody else’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reason why he attempted to take Grid’s body was to make an alarm ring with Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It might seem threatening, but it was intended to do a favor for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He’s a person who makes me nervous, but he’s also the benefactor who achieved my 300 year old wish.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was his way of expressing his appreciation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid didn’t know it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Well, we might be enemies when next we meet.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham’s soul started moving.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His destination was the Sword Grave.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was where Braham’s body was sealed.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Reidan was a city that aimed to be the next Talima.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, Administrator Rabbit invested most of the budget into blacksmithing and alchemy development.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But it was funny.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Currently, the most developed area in Reidan was agriculture.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Fields spread out in all directions around Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Now the crops are growing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid returned after completing a quest that he had left alone for a year and a half.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He looked around at the fields.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I think the scale has become bigger...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He didn’t know why, but Piaro had a passive skill that had a 100% chance of making the land fertile.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to this, Reidan always enjoyed the pleasure of a &nbsp;good harvest, no matter what crops were grown.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The agricultural products accounted for the largest portion of the items that Reidan exported.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'It is rumored that this is an agricultural city.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A city with a legendary blacksmith had become an agricultural city?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was indeed ironic. Honestly, Grid didn’t like it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The agricultural section of Reidan was growing despite not having a big budget invested in it!&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t know if he should be glad or sad.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The confused Grid stopped in place at the rice fields.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because a scene captured his gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You can do it! A newcomer will arrive in one hour!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay! Heok? Dammit! We have been waiting for a new guy!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Heave ho, heave ho.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Farmers were working hard, using various farming equipment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Users were mixed in among them?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The desert ecosystem had stabilized thanks to the activities of the Overgeared members, but the barrier of entry was still high.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was unthinkable to step foot in this place unless they were level 260+ users.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In Reidan, it was difficult to find users other than the Overgeared members, and the residents were NPCs.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In such a situation, why were users farming?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As Grid was feeling doubts.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro, leader of Overgeared Knights Division and commander in chief of Reidan appeared in the fields.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He started to lecture the hard working users in the field.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It isn’t about the quality of the hand plow. More wrist...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Isn’t the ground too fine? This isn’t the only way to plant seedlings. Brownie trees grow better in rough soil.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A legendary farmer has been born!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He recalled the phrase he witnessed a few months ago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was blank with shock for a moment, before shaking his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No. Piaro dreams of being a sword saint, so he can’t be a farmer. My Piaro isn’t a farmer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He decided, but he couldn’t bring himself to check Piaro’s details using the Great Lord's Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I should ask about the Amethyst Shield next time...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He didn’t want to talk to Piaro while he was wearing a straw hat.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Trudge trudge.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s footsteps were heavy as he ignored Piaro and moved away from the fields.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, 21 users were working in the fields under Piaro’s direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Dammit... A 55th ranked magician has to be farming.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have to swing a hand plow instead of a sword...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 21 users caught by Piaro had a high level. Most of them were in the late 200s.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They came to Reidan to join Overgeared, but unfortunately couldn’t join the guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because they were caught by a crazy farmer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The crazy farmer was naturally Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the past when he dreamed of &nbsp;becoming a sword saint, he enjoyed fighting with strong users and caught the ankles of high level users. After becoming a legendary farmer, he caught the users’ ankles for another reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will develop Reidan into the best agricultural city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The problem was that Administrator Rabbit didn’t increase their budget.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, he was lacking manpower.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Insufficient manpower?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had to make up the difference.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Uhuh! That isn't how you use a hand plow!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Hah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The users caught by Piaro could only sigh.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the reason they stayed in the fields was because of the reward of the quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Fun and Enjoyable Training!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">★ Hidden Quest ★</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Live with the farmer Piaro in Reidan. If you join him, you can grow significantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Conditions: Live together with Piaro for three weeks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Rewards: All stats +10. The skill ‘Farming’ will be obtained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reward was low compared to the hidden quest that Kraugel and Damian received. However, that was just a story for the two people. From a general point of view, the reward of +10 to all stats was tremendous.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There is a crazy farmer in Reidan. He will fight you and knock you down. Don’t run away. That’s right. If you can endure the trials that will follow, you will be able to taste sweet fruit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A strange rumor started to circulate on the Internet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most people thought it was a ghost story, but the seven guilds were different.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Crazy farmer...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Reidan was still being guarded by him?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The 2nd ranked Zibal grabbed his forehead.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His forehead was still sore.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The first person Grid looked for when he arrived in Reidan wasn’t Irene or Khan. It wasn’t Lauel or Rabbit either.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh? Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Laella.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A beautiful British woman who was a world class idol.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was once her fan. Rather than her excellent vocal ability or appearance, Grid liked her because her body suited his tastes. Her breasts were very large. It was enough to be reminiscent of fruit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What did you find me for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid stared at her breasts as always.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Laella’s face turned red with embarrassment and she hurriedly asked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid regained his spirit at her reaction and explained his purpose.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hum hum, this time I learned magic. I want to accurately test its power.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Laella was in charge of the magicians at Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was a facility for measuring magic power in the mage barracks that she was in charge of, and Grid wanted to use it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Magic?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Laella’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The blacksmith Grid could use magic?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“How can you use magic…? Ah! You did a quest related to Braham. Did you learn a spell from Braham? What spell did he teach you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid replied to Laella without hiding anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Magic Missile."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Ah, yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Indeed, it would be hard to teach a blacksmith proper magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Laella couldn’t hide her disappointment and led Grid to the training ground behind the barracks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Fireball!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ice Arrow!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the Ul Clan, who Grid had saved from destruction.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were gifted in magic and were training on one side of the training ground.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Laella pointed to a silver scarecrow as Grid was observing the Ul Clan with a proud expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The scarecrow was produced by Reidan’s alchemy facility. It was a type of magic sandbag that could set the magic resistance from 0 to 5,000.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“First, set the magic resistance to zero.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid stood in front of the scarecrow and Laella said to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I have set it up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay! Magic Missile!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid aimed at the scarecrow and shouted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then a white flash struck the scarecrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 2,894 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The effects of various titles, Malacus’ Cloak and the Black Quartz Earrings meant that he currently had 1,048 intelligence.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The resulting magic power was 1,258.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The buff on the pavranium increased magic power by 15%, so Grid’s final magic power was 1,447.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The expected maximum damage of Magic Missile (Enhanced) was 2,894, and this was the result that emerged.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Laella was startled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Isn’t this surprisingly powerful? Is he wearing items that amplify magic power?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A blacksmith didn’t invest points in the intelligence stat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Laella thought that Grid had 400 intelligence at most.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The damage that users could exercise with a Lv. 1 Magic Missile and 400 magic power was very small.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s Magic Missile was remarkably powerful.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid spoke to the stunned Laella.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Increase the scarecrow’s magic resistance to the maximum.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The maximum was 5,000.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even most boss monsters didn’t have this much magic resistance. Magic Missile would be completely ineffective against it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There will be no damage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid just urged Laella.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hurry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'It’s a pointless experiment.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Laella thought that Grid was so excited about magic that rational judgment was impossible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She imagined Grid’s look of disappointment as she set the scarecrow’s magic resistance to 5,000.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then after a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 2,894 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Laella was astonished.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s Magic Missile ignored 100% of the target’s magic resistance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In short, it was a scam.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Laella hiccuped with surprise, while Grid made a satisfied expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It isn’t very efficient in hunting or raids.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was great against users whose maximum health was only 10,000.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The activation time was one second and the cooldown time was five seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a spell that would be very useful in PvP.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A dark smile appeared on Grid’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then a guest came to see him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a completely unexpected guest.</span></p>
