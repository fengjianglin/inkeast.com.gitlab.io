 <p><span style="">Chapter 394</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘For Kill to only do 1 damage, it isn’t just physical defense. They have resistance to physical attacks. The status resistance is also high.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Kill Lv. 6 (57.1%)]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A killing sword that expresses hatred.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Deals 1,800% of your attack power to a single target. There will be a bleeding and desperation effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Usage Conditions: Have a sword type weapon equipped.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Mana Cost: 1,000</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Stamina Consumption: Consumes 20% of your stamina.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 380 seconds</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As with any skill, Kill was steadily strengthened as the level rose.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The resource consumption and cooldown time decreased, while the power increased.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The level 360~370 monsters on the islands in the 40’s would lose more than 60% of their health if hit by Grid’s Kill unleashed from Grid’s Greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, the golden crown received only 1 damage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This couldn’t be explained with just high defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I need to check to make sure.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid thought and planned as the golden crown aimed the club at his head.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 6,360 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t a damage that Grid could make fun of.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘One-tenth of my health disappeared in one blow.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At level 300, one strength stat increased health by 7, while one stamina stat increased health by 25.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was the 6,000 health added by the Holy Light Set, the 3,000 health added by the Man who has Touched Hell title, and 3,000 health added by Tiramet’s Belt and Tiramet’s Shoulderguards, giving Grid approximately 63,000 health.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now he received 6,000 damage from base damage, not a skill, so he became tense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Let's concentrate.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid moved forward.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He aimed Pinnacle at the golden crown.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Pinnacle Lv. 3 (15.9%)]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A sword that expresses the essence of a warrior god.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Deals 780% of your attack power to a single target. This skill will ignore 62% of the target’s armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Usage Conditions: Have a sword type weapon equipped.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Mana Cost: 700</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 143 seconds&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Pinnacle slashed at the wide chest of the golden crown. Looking at the momentum, it was a blow that could cut the golden crown in half.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the result?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 1 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Indeed.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was convinced.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This green monster with a golden crown resisted physical attacks. The proof was that Pinnacle, which ignored the target’s defense, only dealt 1 damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Their weakness...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Enemies immune to physical damage were vulnerable to magic, just as those immune to magic were vulnerable to physical attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was common sense for users playing Satisfy, and the reason why party play was prevalent in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was difficult for a warrior with strong physical attacks or a magician with high magic power to overcome crises in the game alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid was different. He had the ability to play the game by himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was it because of his legendary class?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, it was because of his relationship with Braham.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Due to that bond, Grid had learned magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Magic Missile."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Magic Missile (Enhanced) Lv. 2 (37%)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A magic missile developed by the legendary great magician who has completely overturned the activation formula.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It boasts tremendous power, but consumes a lot of resources.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It deals damage equal to twice your current magic power to the target. It also ignores the enemy’s magic resistance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Resource Consumption: 380 Mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Casting Time: 1 second.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 4.8 seconds</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A sharp flash of light pierced the heart of the golden crown.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The biggest advantage of Magic Missile was its fast casting speed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid smiled with satisfaction as he saw the golden crown that couldn’t cope with the sudden emergence of Magic Missile.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But that smile didn’t last long.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 1 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It resisted physical and magic attacks?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The golden crown struck the confused Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 6,160 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This really hurts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid wore the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch. His ability to read the enemy’s attack orbit was excellent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the golden crown was a level 380 monster, so its physical abilities far overwhelmed the level 305 Grid. In addition, there was the penalty due to the level difference.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As a result, Grid couldn’t fully read the movements of the golden crown and allowed a successive string of attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was pushed back by the momentum.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kiyaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The golden crown approached and swung its club again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This damn monster...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was 17 minutes and 1 second remaining for the mission time limit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He needed to hunt 10 golden crowns in 20 minutes, but he couldn’t even hunt one in 3 minutes, making Grid feel nervous.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he didn’t despair.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Keep my composure.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had numerous experiences with unexpected things. He wouldn’t repeat the same mistakes again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid calmly blocked the golden crown’s onslaught.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Physical attacks and magic attacks don’t work on the opponent.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then how could he hunt them?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was blocking the club from hitting his collarbone when he remembered an unusual monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Mimic!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Mimic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were monsters that looked like treasure chests to deceive adventurers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">One of their greatest strengths was that they had the ‘resist all damage’ passive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had only met a mimic once.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No matter the attack, it only suffers 1 damage.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, this didn’t mean that a mimic was invincible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The maximum health of a mimic was 10~120 depending on their level.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid only dealt 1 damage, but he would be able to hunt it if he hit it many times in a row.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid judged that the golden crown was a monster like a mimic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is only 1 damage per hit, but they have low health.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He just needed to hit them a lot.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grod swapped from Grid’s Greatsword to Iyarugt to increase his attack speed and used Link.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pit!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pipipipipit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[Link Lv. 7 (61.2%)]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A dazzling sword dance that is like the wings of a butterfly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Deals 800% of your attack power to a single target.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Usage Conditions: Have a sword type weapon equipped.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Mana Cost: 300</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 60 seconds</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The number of strikes for Link was proportional to the attack speed. With Iyarugt, he could do a total of 25 strikes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 1 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 1 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt...]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The biggest advantage was that continuous attacks caused the target to stiffen.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Due to the series of attacks, the golden crowns were unable to move. Grid used Continuous Stab during that gap.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the skill he acquired from the reservist training.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A total of five stabs struck the golden crown’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the midst of this, the God Hands were also moving rapidly. All of them held a weapon and attacked the golden hands without stopping.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It should be now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid believed that the golden crown’s health gauge should’ve fallen sharply.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But reality was relentless when he checked it with his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Despite the efforts of Grid and the God Hands, the golden crown’s health gauge was still full.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid realized.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The golden crown was different from a mimic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Should I try another way?’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pakak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s face was hit by the club while he was trying to think.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuuong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid felt pain as he was thrown back and hit a rock.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kilkil!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid heard a bad laugh from above his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Don’t tell me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid stiffened as he looked in the direction of the laughter. Then he felt despair.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Three golden crowns were looking down at him from a rock.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The worst.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He couldn’t do anything against one golden crown. Now three more enemies were added.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I am going to die from normal mobs, not a boss.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the beginning, Grid was killed by rabbits. But this experience became unfamiliar since becoming Pagma’s Descendant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The mental blow was very big.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'There has to be a way...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The three golden crowns jumped from the rock.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Fortunately, there was a lack of cooperation and the separate attacks could be blocked by the God Hands, buying time for Grid’s brain to work. He couldn’t think of a way to overcome this crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Should I just give up and die?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had barely recovered the experience that he lost from dying to the clone, and now he had to die again? It couldn’t be.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It would be better to give up the mission and survive.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid decided and was about to summon Randy and Noe.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The name is golden crown? The body isn’t the green monster, but the crown on its head.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an unexpected voice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The familiar voice entered Grid’s ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You...!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was confused by the unimaginable existence and raised his head to look at the sky, where a faint soul was floating.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Braham’s soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Pagma’s Descendant is playing around in the playground that Pagma made.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Originally, Braham’s voice was filled with infinite power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It contained absolutely confidence and magic power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But not anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Compared to before, Braham’s voice was very weak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'He still hasn’t found his body? What on earth happened?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why did he come here in the first place?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was puzzled but still kept an eye on the golden crowns.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After avoiding the clubs flying from the front and rear, he cut the golden crown of a green monster with Iyarugt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 5,900 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is the strategy to handle them.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to Braham, Grid got a glimpse of the light. But he still had to give up on the mission.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was 12 minutes and 59 seconds remaining.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He might’ve discovered the weakness of the golden crowns, but it was difficult to beat 10 of them in that time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham suggested to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Accept my soul once again. This time for a bit longer than before.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid received a hidden quest.</span></p>
