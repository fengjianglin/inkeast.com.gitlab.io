 <p><span style="">Weight: 8,302/17,540&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After three days of struggle, I was able to grow rapidly by exterminating the frostlight orcs.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was level 45 when I first came here and now I was level 83.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“3 days... level 83 in only 3 days...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In my days as a warrior, I spent a year trying to reach level 80.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was due to a lack of talent and financial power, but I had blamed the system.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, now I caught up with my level as a warrior in just three days. It seemed impossible.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"In the past, I never really played the game... Or is it that I’m too fraudulent now...?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">I concluded that I didn’t really play the game in the past.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"If I think about it, people who buy one good item can reach level 100 in just a month. It isn’t so great that I gained 38 levels in three days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I opened my inventory while once again realizing that money was the best.&nbsp;</span><span style="">My inventory was filled with 40 frostlight orc leather, 60 old jewels, crude hand axes and bows, and three sylphid scales.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I have 580 gold... It isn’t a bad income.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I whistled with satisfaction, when my spine suddenly felt cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wait, I only have three sylphid scales?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I had been so blinded by leveling up that I forgot for a moment, but why did I come here to hunt the orcs?&nbsp;</span><span style="">I meant to obtain 20 sylphid scales!&nbsp;</span><span style="">But I only obtained three sylphid scales after three days of hunting?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this? Why are there only three sylphid scales? I hunted over 80 orcs!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This meant the probability of dropping sylphid scales was extremely low!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Huroi reached me as I belatedly realized this fact.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid, hello.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi had been observing me for a while. I knew it, so I wasn’t surprised by Huroi’s appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah, you came.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Heok? Grid! Did you perhaps hit your head?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What are you saying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No, isn’t this strange? Normally you would be cursing at me and turning me away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Oh, that is true. So? Do you want me to swear everytime I see you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi hurriedly shook his head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"No, I would never want something like that. This is much better. I’m glad that you are acknowledging me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi scratched his head and laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Until recently, Huroi seemed like a crazy person, so I didn’t want anything to do with him. But now it was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I got the title of Apostle of Justice from saving Huroi, and due to it, I became stronger and it was easier to hunt orcs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I decided to stop ignoring Huroi and attempted a conversation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Huroi, I understand why you think of me as a savior. I was the one to rescue you from prison. But why would you want to serve me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi’s eyes widened as I expressed my intention to communicate, then he explained with a bright expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I wasn’t simply stuck in prison. I was doing a quest where I couldn’t log out for 50 hours in real time. I was stuck in solitary confinement for 200 hours in game time. It was truly hell... But Grid was the one who saved me from that hell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? No, what’s with that absurd quest? Being unable to log out and spending 50 hours of real time in solitary confinement? Does it make sense that a quest like that exists?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I didn’t believe him, so Huroi explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It is a quest where the reward was a second class. It was difficult.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Did I hear it wrong? Right?&nbsp;</span><span style="">I doubted my ears and quietly approached Huroi. Then I asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“S-grade quest? The reward was a second class? Is that true?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi glanced at me with unwavering eyes and replied,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“That’s correct.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I grabbed Huroi’s shoulder with trembling hands. Then I took a deep breath and asked,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Perhaps... the first person who obtained a second class was you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi gave a refreshing laugh.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Yes, that's right. Hahahat! Are you surprised? I’m always amazed when I see my story on the news. Hahahahat! This good luck is all thanks to Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"... You should serve me always.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">I inserted strength into the hand that was gripping Huroi’s shoulder.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I had invested most of the stat points acquired during my three days of levelling up into strength. Therefore, Huroi was unable to withstand my high strength and trembled with pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“G-Grid...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh! Kuooh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I couldn’t speak because of my boiling anger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">My jealousy was rising.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The first one to acquire a second class was Huroi!&nbsp;</span><span style="">In addition, I was the one who helped him acquire the second class!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This is...I didn’t realize I was so lucky that I gave you the perfect fortune!”&nbsp;</span><span style="">I grabbed Huroi’s neck and shouted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“You! Serve me for the rest of your life! I will be your master from this day onwards! You are my servant! This damn lucky bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"K-Keeeok! U-Understood. Haven’t I already sworn it? So let go of your hand. I-I can’t breathe...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment I was making a fuss...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuuong!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kuuong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Huge footsteps were approaching from the edge of the village.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Huroi and I became alert as we felt the shaking of the earth, then we saw an orc that was over 4m tall.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is that...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An orc that was reminiscent of a giant ogre!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Huroi exclaimed with amazement.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That is the chief of the frostlight orcs! He’s a level 140 field boss. He must’ve come out after hearing that you exterminated the village.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Certainly, the name Frostlight Orc Chief appeared on top of the giant orc’s head. The boss monster’s name shone a brilliant gold. Behind him were 11 frostlight orcs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I ordered Huroi,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Buy some time while I run away!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi had an obligation to make this sacrifice for me. I planned to abandon Huroi and run away alone. Then why was Huroi following after me instead of staying behind?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“#<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4e6f0e">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>#&amp;! What are you doing? You promised that I was your master! So why aren’t you listening to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi chased after me and explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"There is no need! If we combine our abilities, we can hunt him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I hesitated and Huroi explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The identity of my second class is the ‘Apostle of Justice’s Partner!’ When I am with the Apostle of Justice, all my stats will increase by 20% And I am currently level 138! You also overwhelmed the knights, so if we join forces, we can deal with a level 140 field boss!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi was full of confidence. I recalled the appearance of Huroi blocked a knight’s sword with his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘That’s right. This bastard is very strong. And I am stronger than before!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the first place, field bosses were much weaker than normal boss monsters in dungeons. There were overwhelming field bosses like the Guardian of the Forest, but those were rare cases.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Speaking of which, don’t rankers often take care of field bosses alone?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If a legendary class and a person with a second class joined forces, wouldn’t a 2-man raid on a level 140 field boss be possible?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Okay.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I decided not to run away anymore. Then I grabbed my dagger and warned Huroi.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Hey! Didn’t you say that you came here purely because of me? Then all the items dropped from that boss are mine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What are you saying...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? Didn’t you promise to serve me? Then are you planning to gobble up your master’s items?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No. I am glad just to be able to fight with you. My second class is only noteworthy when I’m with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Good, let’s get started!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I set up the party item distribution as ‘Party Leader Pickup’ and invited Huroi to the party.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The party invitation has been accepted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As a party, we could confirm each other’s level, but not our class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Huroi was shocked after checking my level.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“G-Grid? Is this true? You’re only level 83?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"So what? Do you have any complaints?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No, I’m just wondering how a level 83 user could overwhelm the knights and kill the frostlight orcs. Ah! Perhaps you have a hidden class? One of the epic classes that only three people have...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An epic class?&nbsp;</span><span style="">I wasn’t such a lowly thing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I had a legendary class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But I didn’t feel the necessity to reveal it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Well, something like that. Hey, wouldn’t it be better to handle the mobs before focusing on the boss?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh? Ah, yes. Right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes, okay. I will handle the mobs while you draw the boss’ aggro.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“M-Me? Ah, yes! I understand! Of course I should do such a thing!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi moved towards the 11 frostlight orcs and shouted towards the chief.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Hey, you <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="381c4678">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>!#! Your opponent is me! You @.$*)%!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the first time I saw it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Someone who swore worse than me!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Roaaaaar-!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The frostlight orc chief became furious at the words and changed his target to Huroi. I faced the 11 frostlight orcs while the chief chased after Huroi and immediately cast my skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Blacksmith's Rage! Unbreakable Justice!”</span></p>
