 <p><span style="">Chapter 28</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">I responded lightly,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The heroes that Pagma mentioned... I’m probably different from them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Disappointment passed over Khan’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This person had an urgent nature.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Should I have some fun?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“To be honest, I’m more similar to Pagma than to those heroes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You are like Pagma? What does that... Ah! No way... are you?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan belatedly realized that while the heroes that Pagma mentioned could use Dainsleif and Valhalla, would they be able to recognize their value?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It would be impossible to understand their value unless the person was a blacksmith on the same level as Albatino.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, I recognized their value.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That meant-</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That’s right! You see! I am Pagma’s descendant.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">I proudly revealed my identity.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I’m the one who can understand Dainsleif and Valhalla better than anyone else, and I can even use them freely! Give me a chance to obtain them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan was extremely excited.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was natural for him to be excited.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Just like his ancestor who faced Pagma 130 years ago, he now had the opportunity to be the one facing Pagma’s descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I understand. If you are Pagma’s descendant, I will definitely hand over the heirlooms to you. But is there any way you can prove that you are Pagma’s descendant?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The quest ‘Pagma’s Descendant’ has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Pagma’s Descendant]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Difficulty: Class quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You have certainly been given Pagma’s blacksmith skills, but do you know exactly who Pagma is? Can you proudly and confidently carry out his will?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Who is Pagma? If he were simply a blacksmith with good skills, his legend wouldn’t be scattered across the continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">First, start with the clue of the swordsmanship that pierced the sky and follow Pagma’s legend. If you can collect all of the legends, you will truly understand Pagma and be the successor to his will.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that moment, a new legend will be born.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* There is no time limit for this class quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* If you accept the class quest of a legendary class, you can’t change your class again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The legendary class quest has the power to transform Satisfy’s world, according to the result.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Class Quest Clear Conditions: Complete all linked quests successfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Class Quest Clear Reward: Unknown.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* First Class Quest: [Pagma’s Swordsmanship.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was said that the force of Pagma’s swordsmanship pierced the sky. This may be a clue to Pagma’s swordsmanship, which wasn’t described in Pagma’s rare book.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* First Class Quest Clear Condition: Learn Pagma’s swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">First Class Quest Clear Reward: Dainsleif (Reproduction).</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Quest is in progress.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I should’ve guessed due to being able to wear all equipment, but Pagma wasn’t just a blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Then what? Is Pagma’s Descendant a class that isn’t limited to just a blacksmith?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What will I look like after completing all quests?&nbsp;</span><span style="">A blacksmith and a warrior? Or, maybe more?&nbsp;</span><span style="">I couldn’t anticipate it yet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Perhaps, a new legend would be born.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Good! I will look for Pagma’s swordsmanship right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was about to leave the smithy with strong footsteps when I suddenly stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Where should I go? In addition, I am currently only level 21. Should I really leave on an adventure without making a plan?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The ultimate goal of the class quest was to collect all of Pagma’s legends scattered throughout the continent. In other words, didn’t I need a level capable of venturing across the continent?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was impossible.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is a quest where I will need to take my time and proceed slowly. I want to finish the quest right now but... it can’t be helped.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My excitement became dull.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan saw my disappointment and handed me a drink.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It is late at night, so why don’t you have a drink? There are many things I want to talk to you about. I want to talk about Pagma, the blacksmith techniques and the future of this smithy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Excuse me... shouldn’t you stop drinking?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Cough cough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I took the bottle from Khan’s hand. Then I found all the other alcohol bottles hidden around the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I will confiscate all of them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A class quest that I wouldn’t know the reward until it was completed!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Someday I would finally clear it, but I couldn’t be rewarded if the client was dead.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I had an obligation to make sure that Khan stopped drinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Today I am happy, so just one bottle...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You can’t.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">I said firmly and placed all the bottles in my inventory.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Okay. If I sell all of this liquor, I can get two gold.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As I was pleased with the thought of earning money, the door of the smithy opened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A slim man entered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He looked at me while adjusting his glasses, then turned and greeted Khan politely.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Are you Khan? It is nice to meet you. I am Rabbit, an employee of the Mero Company.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Mero Company?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The one who hired those gangsters? Doesn’t he look too gentle?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I watched silently.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The nervous Khan warily watched the person called Rabbit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rabbit opened his mouth with a mild expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You owe 600 gold to the Mero Company. But according to what I heard, you don’t have the ability to pay off your debt.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“So you want me to hand you the smithy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I want to give you an opportunity because I have a high opinion of your ability.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oppor...tunity?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes. Khan’s blacksmithing skills are excellent, so I want to buy those skills. How about it? The Mero Company will take ownership of this smithy, but we will transfer the operating rights to you. I promise a high salary.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Mero Company was compromising.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They would own the smithy, but they would let Khan run it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"In other words, the Mero Company will be the dog above me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Haha, you speak such rough words.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“And if I refuse?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit’s expression showed that he didn’t understand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“You refuse? Why? Aren’t these conditions good compared to before?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m not afraid of losing a job! I don’t want to hand over this smithy, which has been in my family for generations.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hrmm... Indeed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The glasses-wearing Rabbit talked to himself while touching his chin.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Then should I use armed force? No, it is a shame to use such a savage method. Can I sue the blacksmith for not paying his debt? No, there are several steps and it will take too long. Khan is stubborn, so what is the best way to persuade him?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Mutter mutter.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">He was an unusual person who revealed his surface thoughts by speaking them aloud.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He soon came up with an idea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Khan, I would like to see if you qualify to keep this smithy. How about it? Compete with the blacksmith the Mero Company will hire. If you make something better than our blacksmith and win, I will admit that you are qualified to be the owner of the smithy. I will also reimburse your debt. But if you lose the game, you must admit that you aren’t qualified and hand the smithy over to us. How about it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The conditions seemed good at first glance, but I thought that Khan should reject it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was obvious that the opponent would be someone more skilled than Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In order for Khan to overcome this crisis, he had to inform the lord that he was unfairly tricked by the Mero Company and seek legal help.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Khan enthusiastically accepted Rabbit’s proposal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I understand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ohh, good choice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan attached some conditions,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“However, I can’t exert my old skills due to drinking and not working for a while. Is it possible for my successor to participate in the game instead of me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit’s expression stiffened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I heard that you didn’t have a successor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You are misinformed. Over there. He is my successor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hoh... I see? He looks too incompetent to be your successor. You want him to participate in the game? Are you certain?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Do I look like I am someone who will joke around?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Well, it is fine with me. Rather, I am grateful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was going on?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why was Khan pointing at me?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The quest ‘Item Production Game with the Mero Company!’ has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan must be crazy! He didn’t ask my permission and just arbitrarily gave me a quest. Wasn’t this too presumptuous?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No, hey, Khan... huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As I was about to express my resentment towards Khan, the quest window popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Item Production Game with the Mero Company!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Difficulty: A</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Mero Company has asked Khan to compete in a blacksmith game.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Khan is in the worst condition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan decided that it was too hard for him to participate in the tournament, passing it on to you.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Conditions: Win in the game against the Mero Company.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Reward: +500 reputation in Winston. The affinity with the Winston residents will rise. 600 gold prize.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Failure: Reputation in Winston will fall to a minimum.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan’s smithy will belong to the Mero Company.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Would you like to accept the quest?)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I canceled my curses towards Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Look at the quest success rewards!&nbsp;</span><span style="">600 gold! A huge 600 gold!&nbsp;</span><span style="">How much was 600 gold in cash? 100 gold was 120,000 won...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"720,000 won!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">720,000 won was a huge amount that could only be earned by doing labor tasks all day without resting, for eight days.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What was the failure penalty compared to the tremendous success rewards?&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was still some damage, but Khan would be the one receiving most of it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I never thought there would be a day when this honey-like quest would come to me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why would I refuse? I accept the quest!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The quest has been accepted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit asked with a surprised expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hoh? Is your successor not avoiding it? He is surprisingly confident.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is so surprising? Look at my brave face. I clearly look confident right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huhut, that can either be good or poisonous... Okay. I will pass on the place and date that the game will take place in the near future. Then farewell until that day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then Rabbit left.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan knelt in front of me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m sorry. I’m really sorry. Doing this without consulting you... But it couldn’t be helped. I want to keep this smithy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I pulled Khan up. Then I embraced him tightly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Why are you sorry? Don’t be bothered. Is there a need to be sorry considering our relationship? I will help you. So don’t worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ahh... thank you... Thank you very much. I wonder if there is another angel like you? Sob sob!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan's tears soaked my clothes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I would like to ask for laundry money, but I didn’t need to go that far.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was thanks to Khan that I had the opportunity to earn 720,000 won.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kukukuk... kuhahahaha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Winston! Blessed land! You are so lovely!</span></p>
