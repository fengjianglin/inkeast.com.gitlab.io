 <p><span style="">Chapter 55</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">I didn’t leave the smithy for the entirety of last month.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From the moment I connected to Satisfy to the time I logged out, I stayed at the smithy the whole time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the meantime, I was able to establish some facts that I knew dimly or discovered new facts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">First, making the same items repeatedly wasn’t effective in raising the skill experience. Every time I made a different item, the skill experience would rise at a good rate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Secondly, the better the materials, the higher the possibility that the item would have a higher rating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">For example, when making two iron swords based on the same production method, the iron sword with the poor-quality metal had a close to 100% chance of being a normal rating, whereas the one made with the finest metal had a relatively high probability of receiving a rare rating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thirdly, even when I was making items with the same production method and materials, the ones that I spent longer on were the ones that were more likely to have a higher rating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was very fortunate that I managed to make a unique dagger in only three hours. I had to invest at least half an hour if I wanted to make an item higher than a rare rating.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In other words, the number of items that could be produced in one day was very limited, so increasing my stats wasn’t as easy of a feat as I thought it would be.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Fourthly, if I wanted to be a good blacksmith, I had to invest points in stamina, as well as in strength and in dexterity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The equipment and minerals used in a smithy were mostly heavy, so I needed high strength to work efficiently. When making an item, I needed to have a lot of stamina if I didn’t want to become exhausted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">So I really liked my high strength and stamina stat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Pant pant...aren’t you still young? You can’t be exhausted yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Unlike Khan who took a break every time an item was completed, I was able to produce items constantly without taking a break when I was connected to Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the past month, I created 73 items, meaning I produced an average of two or more items a day.&nbsp;</span><span style="">11 of the 73 items had a rare rating and 3 of the 73 had an epic rating. As a result, all of my stats increased by 34 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I currently had 11 types of stats: strength, stamina, agility, intelligence, dexterity, persistence, composure, indomitable, dignity, insight and courage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If 11 stats increased by 34 points each, this meant it was increased by 374 points, which was equivalent to gaining 37 levels.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But I was dissatisfied.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why?&nbsp;</span><span style="">I made 73 items. I invested at least six hours every time I made an item. The materials were also as good as possible within my range.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, I never made one unique rated item, let alone a legendary one.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wasn’t this too much?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I only got three epic rated items... Crazy. Is this a legendary blacksmith? Ah, I’m so tired.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Every time I made an item, I earnestly prayed for a unique rating. However, it was almost always a normal rating. Every time, I felt an incredible sense of disappointment and wanted to curse at the game.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The only comfort was that the level of my production skills increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lv. 2</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Produce equipment items that you know how to make.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You can create the production methods for a new item with the ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There is a certain probability of producing rare~ epic rated items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There is a rare probability of creating unique rated items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There is a very rare probability of creating legendary rated items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">All stats of a production item will increase by 12%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When rare rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +2 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +30.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When epic rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +4 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +80.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When unique rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +12 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +300.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When legendary rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +25 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +1,000.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Something special will occur with every five legendary items created.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation Skill]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You can create three equipment item production methods every time the skill level of the ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill’ goes up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Number of items that can be created at present: 5/6.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When items are produced using this skill, the name of the creator is automatically placed on the item.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lv. 2</span></p>
 <p><span style="">When you are concentrating on making an item, the will of Pagma’s Descendant will fill the production item.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">All stats of a production item will increase by 7%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There is a rare chance of giving special features to your production items.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">&nbsp;In addition to the increase in my skill levels, there was something else that was gratifying.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I had created dozens of items in Khan’s smithy over the past month.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan wanted to pass on as much knowledge to me as possible before he retired, so I was given one new production method every day.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was an enormous harvest. The original method of acquiring production items was to perform specific quests, and the level of difficulty varied.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thus, it was very difficult to find item production methods. I was fortunate enough to acquire many production methods without the need for separate quests, thanks to being Khan’s successor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I pulled out a book from my inventory. The title was ‘List of Items Production Methods.’ The book described the details of the production methods I learned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The table of contents had expanded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Starting from my own ‘Failure’ to the Jaffa Arrows I learned in Bairan, to the dozens of works acquired from Khan...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was exciting.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘When I was in Bairan Village, I had only four production methods, including the axe, pickaxe, Jaffa Arrow and Failure...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">When I looked at the production methods, Euphemina entered my mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why hasn’t that woman come with the method to create the orb?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina wanted me to make an orb for her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That’s why it was highly likely that she would bring the best production method.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then I would be able to get my hands on a production method for free.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was happy just imagining it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, wait...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If...if there is only one chance... what if Euphemina brings me the production method and materials, only for me to make a normal-rated orb?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Would she take my life?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Maybe Euphemina would keep me locked up somewhere until I managed to complete a unique rated orb.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“If it is her...”&nbsp;</span><span style="">I recalled the psychotic smile on Euphemina’s face as she burned the lord’s bodyguards.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“...What will she do to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I no longer waited for Euphemina.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rather, I wished that she would never show up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I shook with terror. Then the door of the smithy opened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hiik! E-Euphemina?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was an old saying that a tiger would come when mentioned. It felt like Euphemina had been waiting for me to mention her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Fortunately, the people who arrived at the smithy wasn’t Euphemina. At first glance, they looked like two incredibly high-level male users.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is this Khan’s smithy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I am Khan... why are you looking for me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They started questioning Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"You competed in the item production game with a traveller called Erina a month ago right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That’s right...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is she really a blacksmith? Did you witness her making the item with your own eyes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The question is strange. Is she a blacksmith? Of course she is a blacksmith. She was hired by the Mero Company to participate in the game and I have directly experienced her great blacksmith skills. No, who on earth are you? Why are you asking such strange questions?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The men disregarded Khan’s question and talked among themselves. Then they asked Khan again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is the Mero Company the only organization involved in the item production game? Is there any chance of other organizations being involved?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Displeasure appeared on Khan’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had been friendly because they were young boys of a similar age to his son, but they ignored his questions and only cared about themselves.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The men didn’t care at all about Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rather, they began to talk over Khan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why aren’t you answering? If you know anything, shouldn’t you tell me? It is better if you don’t waste our time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was like a threat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How funny.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was Khan’s smithy. These people were guests. They weren’t in the position to question Khan. Then what was with their attitude?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were talking down to Khan, who was similar to their grandfathers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were ignoring Khan because he was an NPC. In fact, this wasn’t unusual among users.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Certainly, NPCs weren’t human. They were just part of the system program, artificial intelligences.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But I knew.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Despite being artificially made, Khan had his own memories and feelings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He could feel anger and hopelessness. He could cry when sad and laugh when happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was someone I could count on.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And sometimes he missed his dead son.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">So I was angry at those who treated Khan casually.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Hey, you over there, what is with your attitude? What right do you have to threaten Khan? Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They looked me up and down and laughed as they saw my dirty clothes and old blacksmith hammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Who is this? When did he get here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What? Why were they speaking impolitely when I wasn’t an NPC?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“When did I get here? I am obviously an employee here. Why are you so arrogant when entering someone else’s business? Huh? Is this your business?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Arrogant? Don’t make me laugh. We just want cooperation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is that the attitude of someone seeking cooperation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hah... should we have visited with orange juice?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I really hated people like this. Looking at their equipment, they seemed to be rankers close to level 200. However, I couldn’t help being honest when seeing their expressions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His companion started mediation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"You shouldn’t get so heated up against a beginner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sigh, okay. I have to calm down. Damn, my nerves are irritated after Faker was attacked. Hey, beginner blacksmith, we are looking for the woman. We are in a hurry to find her so we were inadvertently rude to the NPC. It was a mistake. &nbsp;I’m sorry. Is it okay now? So please move out of the way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You should apologize to Khan, not me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They started ignoring me. They asked Khan once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Khan, answer me. Do you know if Erina is associated with any organizations besides the Mero Company?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was he worried that I would get hurt?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan hid me behind his back and replied.&nbsp;</span></p>
