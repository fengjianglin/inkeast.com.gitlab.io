 <p><span style="">Chapter 412</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">[Ice Shield (Lv.8) has been used.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Creates a shield that absorbs 10,000 (+11,532) damage.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The shield will increase your physical defense by 30% and magic resistance by 20%, and will reflect back 30% of the damage as ice debris.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was necessary to use a lot of magic in order to increase the proficiency of magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it shouldn’t be used in a meaningless manner. It needed to be used with a purpose to increase proficiency.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">For example, in order to increase the proficiency of shield magic, it was necessary to defend against an enemy attack with the shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, a magician was a class with low health and weak defense. They were extremely reluctant to allow enemy attacks, so the actual combat method was focused on not allowing enemy attacks. They took advantage of various spells to maintain a proper distance from the enemy and killed them before the enemy could approach.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Therefore, most magicians only had low level shielding magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Bondre raised the level of Ice Shield through his constant efforts. If he raised it two more levels, it would be mastered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a result of abandoning the typical magician combat style and confronting the enemy’s attacks with his shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why suffer in order to raise the level of Ice Shield?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reason was simple. It was to prepare for a decisive battle with Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I only dreamed about getting revenge!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid used Fly and his various resistances to magic in order to instantly narrow the distance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Indeed, this was the counter for a magician.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Bondre had already faced Grid once before and didn’t panic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As soon as he faced Grid’s Kill, he calmly cast the Ice Shield and then started the chant for an attack spell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The shield can endure the bombardment!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bondre believed in his shield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was convinced that his level 8 Ice Shield &nbsp;couldn’t be destroyed in the National Competition where PvP damage was reduced by 50%.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid caused a reversal.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 23,210 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[21,532 damage has been absorbed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The target will receive 30% of the damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 6,963 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Ice Shield is turned off.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cough...! N-No, this is crazy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bondre’s face distorted as he coughed up blood.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid suffered the most damage, but Bondre’s mental shock was great.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'What a monster!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His shield was smashed despite the 50% drop in damage?&nbsp;</span><span style="">How powerful was Grid’s original attack?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was only a moment, but Bondre felt afraid of Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it cleared in an instant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As the peak of 41,000 ice mystics and a representative of his country, he could never weaken or feel distress.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Bondre barely sidestepped Grid’s swing and shouted the last words of his spell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ice Dragon’s Fury!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The whole area became dominated with a chill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From the turbulent earth, huge ice pillars rose like dragons and threatened Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Power, speed and range.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bondre’s magic wasn’t lacking anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The earth quickly froze and frost covered the forest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The frost, ice pillars and Grid who was stiff like a statue, not moving.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was like he was overwhelmed by the phenomenal magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The French people who saw it cheered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid is stuck!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There is no escaping this magic! Indeed, Bondre is great! A genius!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right! Last year Bondre wasn’t alert! Go Bondre! Take down Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Bondre!! Bondre!! Bondre!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At this moment, most people in the world thought that Grid would be defeated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bondre was different from the person who couldn’t endure Grid’s strike last year. This impression was implanted on the spectators.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the distance, the US team competing with other teams to capture the highlands also believed in Bondre’s victory.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal smiled at the sight of the ice pillars rising high in the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Bondre’s mighty power can’t be endured. By taking advantage of the structure of ice, the enemy’s actions are blocked and a complete victory can be achieved. The successful emergence of S-grade magic means it is the end for Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don't make me laugh."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Someone snorted at Zibal’s words.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Pon, a member of the Spanish team that was confronting the US team.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He asserted as he threatened Zibal with his spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You can’t measure Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Baby small fry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon, who was 10th on the unified rankings, was one of the five influential figures of Overgeared. B</span><span style="">ut Zibal was 2nd on the rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was natural that he should be dominant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pon’s spear flying from the front suddenly changed orbit to the side. It was unexpected and Zibal was slow to respond.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal groaned as his side was hit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was once again shocked as he saw the damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why is it so painful?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal had been steadily taking elixirs and used the overwhelming resources he accumulated as master of one of the seven guilds to arm himself with the strongest equipment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was even 20 levels higher than Pon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From a common sense point of view, it was normal for Zibal to not suffer great damage from Pon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he was confused by the unexpected damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel summoned a gust of wind to block Pon’s next attack and warned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Zibal, I admit that you are strong. But don’t be overconfident. The power of Overgeared can’t be compared to what it was a year ago.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Due to the Reidan desert, the vampire cities and the Behen Archipelago, the Overgeared members reached a level that was beyond common sense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And Grid had achieved overwhelming development among the Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A powerful frost has frozen your body. All speeds will decrease by 20%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Revolve.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kurururu!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Heok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid stood still as he faced the huge and mighty ice pillar dragons.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wasn’t humbly accepting death.&nbsp;</span><span style="">By rotating his sword, he reversed the path of the ice pillar, causing Bondre to be directly hit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"W-What? A counterattack...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Typically, counterattacks could only be used against attacks of the same type.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Physical force was counterattacked with a physical attack, while magic was counterattacked with magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid used physical force to counterattack against magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Furthermore, the attack was returned with more than 100% of the damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was unbelievable, a fraudulent skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Bondre wasn’t surprised at the function of the skill itself. He was amazed at Grid’s skill to fully utilize the counterattack.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It needed to be used at the perfect timing, so very few players could use a counterattack in a fight against top rankers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Grid...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid, who was rated as having a low level of control, used a counterattack perfectly against Bondre.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This guy... What has he been doing in the past year?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bondre became bloody.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He looked at the deep eyes of the approaching Grid and realized.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can’t measure him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He didn’t know what trials Grid had gone through over the past year and how he had overcome them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bondre couldn’t imagine it at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Bondre! We’ll join in!}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The French representatives hadn’t participated in the battle because Bondre asked for a one-on-one match against Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bondre hurriedly shouted at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{No, abandon me and run away. We can’t handle Grid without some sacrifices.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{What?}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The rankings were constantly going down due to the rapid growth of the Overgeared members, but Bondre was still in the top 20.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His pride was high and he had some of the best skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bondre and most people believed that he was defeated by Grid last year because he wasn’t vigilant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But right now, Bondre acknowledged Grid’s skills. This person was above him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was unfamiliar to the French team, who knew Bondre well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{I will earn as much time as possible, so run away. Leave the South Korean team alone and focus on the targets. Aim for a bronze medal.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As Bondre was talking with his team members...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Shaaaaaah</span></i><span style="">-</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid recalled Grid’s Greatsword and took out Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The sword scattered a red light like jewels, capturing the eyes of the hundreds of thousands of spectators.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The cameras were dazzled by Iyarugt’s beauty and zoomed in.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was natural that the appearance of Grid, the master of Iyarugt, would receive the attention of people from all over the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Bondre, you developed a lot compared to last year. I acknowledge your growth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s original personality would’ve mocked Bondre.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bondre was one of the guild masters who dared to invade Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid didn’t disparage Bondre.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was he worried about the image of Overgeared in the competition where millions of people were watching?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That was a secondary problem.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid didn’t ridicule Bondre, because he truly acknowledged Bondre’s skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He could see how hard he had worked and how much Bondre had grown over the past year, and Grid couldn’t put him down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You are strong. But I am stronger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Hat! You are ridiculous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bondre burst out laughing and summoned ice barriers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was worried that his team members would become Grid’s targets and wanted to buy as much time as possible by squeezing out all his power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It won’t be so easy when we meet again next year.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bondre shouted at Grid from behind the ice barriers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid nodded and rushed forward.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjeejeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Subsequently, the ice barriers were destroyed by Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The sharp ice arrows and ice spears couldn’t stop Grid’s movements.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid didn’t try to avoid the ice arrows and spears. He just accepted them while approaching Bondre.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The magic resistance of the Holy Light Set was extremely high and there was also the 50% drop in PvP damage. The synergy between the patch and his armor made Bondre into a fool.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 B-Bondre, logout!! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bondre, a leading figure in France, eventually kneeled down and died.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This helplessness left a great shock on the French people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Next."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The rejoicing of the winner was short.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After confirming that Bondre has logged out, Grid headed towards the South Korean team who were experiencing a crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Blackening.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The explosion of demonic power made a road around Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s skin became paler and contrasted with his black hair, causing the female viewers to cheer.</span></p>
