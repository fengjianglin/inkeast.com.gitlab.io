 <p>‘Then first...’</p>
 <p><span style="">[Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lv. 2 (76.3%)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Produce equipment items that you know how to make.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You can create the production methods for a new item with the ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There is a certain probability of producing rare~ epic rated items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There is a rare probability of creating unique rated items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There is a very rare probability of creating legendary rated items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* All stats of a production item will increase by 12%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When rare rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +2 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +30.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When epic rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +4 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +80.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When unique rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +12 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +300.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When legendary rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +25 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +1,000.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Something special will occur with every five legendary items created. (Currently 2/5)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lv. 2 (42.5%)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">When you are concentrating on making an item, the will of Pagma’s Descendant will fill the production item.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">All stats of a production item will increase by 7%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There is a rare chance of giving special features to your production items.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My production skills increased from level 1 to 2 a short time after the item production game with Euphemina.&nbsp;</span><span style="">For the last two months, I had made countless normal, rare and epic items. In addition, there were two legendary items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Nevertheless, my skill levels stagnated at level 2.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'The experience is a lot worse compared to level 1...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, the experience of the Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill was close to 80%. If I kept making items in earnest, it would reach level 3.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The problem is the Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath. The breath is random, so it is hard to raise the experience.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I did my best every time I made an item. In particular, it took a long time since I spent more than 20 hours producing one item.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">According to the description of the Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath, it should activate every time I made an item. But the concept of ‘concentration’ seemed more difficult than I thought, and the Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath was only activated occasionally.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The breath wasn’t triggered even when I made the legendary Divine Shield. Therefore, the legendary Divine Shield didn’t have any additional options and was exactly as described in the production method.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I made a legendary item but the breath skill wasn’t activated... When thinking about it now, it is a shock. On the other hand, there was the Sword of Self-transcendence.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A sword made through an ordinary longsword production method became a legendary rating, and this could be attributed to the breath skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Phoenix had described it as a sword that appeared once every 100 years.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The key to my production is whether the breath skill is triggered.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The most important factor for a typical blacksmith was the item’s rating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Normal, rare, epic and unique.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They made their item, hoping that the rating would be the highest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the same for me.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Normal, rare, epic and unique. In addition, there was the legendary rating!&nbsp;</span><span style="">I only eagerly hoped that a highly rated item would be produced. But now my thoughts had changed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">While the rating was important, the breath also played a critical role.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If the breath isn’t triggered, I will produce only the options mentioned in the production method, just like regular blacksmiths. However, when the breath is triggered, the value is much higher, because of the additional options.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Depending on which options were given, a rare item affected by the breath skill might be better than an epic item not affected by the breath skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Of course, the breath skill didn’t necessarily give new options. It was random. But even if an option wasn’t granted, the basic abilities were increased, so it was still a profit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Maybe it is necessary for the level of the breath skill to increase in order for it to be triggered more often...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As long as breath couldn’t be used intentionally, there was no way to quickly raise the level.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I just had to raise it while making items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It means I need to continue grinding in the future... It isn’t easy to become rich.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As I was looking at my blacksmith skills, Vantner came over to me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“If you don’t mind, can you repair my weapon? It has been badly damaged against Malacus.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“If you give me money...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I had never experiencing repairing an item with my own hands before. I only devoted myself to making items. However, the durability of some of my equipment had decreased from recent combat. There was no reason to refuse when Vantner asked me to repair his equipment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Khan, do you have any repair tools?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Of course."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan brought out an anvil, hammer, grindstone, and iron.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the anvil and hammer had ‘repair’ attached to the name.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the first time I saw the repair tools. I asked Khan a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is there a reason to distinguish these tools for repair? Can’t an ordinary anvil and hammer be used for repairs?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Repair hammers and anvils are disposable. As you said, we can repair items with ordinary anvils and hammers but... We can’t do that. Then won’t it be difficult to ask a lot of repair money from the customer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why do we use disposable hammers and anvils? It is to give customers the awareness that ‘hammers and anvils must be consumed’ when repairing. It is a type of gesture to emphasize the favor we are doing them. Due to this advertisement, we can charge higher repair fees... This is a money-making means devised by the ancient blacksmiths. Thus, the repair tools were born.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the reason why I had to pay an expensive amount of money for my items to be repaired?&nbsp;</span><span style="">I had a lot of respect for blacksmiths.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is very desirable to explore new ways to make money... I should learn from this.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner handed me his two axes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Twin Bloody Axes]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 39/500 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 250</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Critical Chance: +20% &nbsp;&nbsp;Critical Damage: +30%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* There is a constant probability of attacking two times.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Can cause bleeding when a critical hit occurs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It is the weapon of the butcher of Kirim Peninsula, Fang. The number of people killed by this axe is immeasurable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 200 or higher. More than 1,000 strength. Advanced Axe Mastery level 1 or higher.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 700&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner said that he invested all his stats into strength, so this was the right weapon for him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘But it is strange.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The average attack power of axe type weapons was higher than that of one-handed swords. In particular, twin axes had an attack power similar to large weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the Twin Bloody Axes was weaker in attack power than the usage conditions and rating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Mister Vantner. Isn’t the attack power of this axe lower than other twin axes of the same rating?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You can tell. That's right. When I compared to twin axes with similar conditions of use, the attack power is 60 points lower. I’m only using this because I like the options but unfortunately... Fang’s raid was really hard... Frankly, Fang’s weapon is more like a lie. I almost suspect that it is a bug. Hey, I am the same age as Pon. Why are you calling Pon ‘Pon’ and me ‘Mister?’ Huh? Are you kidding?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Appraisal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I ignored the suddenly angry person and tried using the Legendary Blacksmith’s Appraisal skill on the Twin Bloody Axes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The blacksmith who becomes a legend can appraise items with an excellent discerning eye. If a hidden feature exists in the target item, it will be found.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttiring~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[Genuine Twin Bloody Axes]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 39/500 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 250~380</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Critical Chance: +20% &nbsp;&nbsp;Critical Damage: +30%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* There is a constant probability of attacking two times.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Can cause bleeding when a critical hit occurs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Causes confusion when a critical strike is activated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The skill ‘Genuine Conversion’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It is the weapon of the butcher of Kirim Peninsula, Fang. The number of people killed by this axe is immeasurable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The joint part of the left-hand axe is offset. As a result, it isn’t easy to transmit force and the power of the axe isn’t exercised properly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But this is an intentional device designed to change the power (weight) of the axe from time to time in order to confuse the enemy. Clicking the button hidden below the join will cause the seams to engage and increase the attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It is a weapon where you can feel the pleasure of disturbing and confusing the enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 200 or higher. More than 1,000 strength. Advanced Axe Mastery level 1 or higher.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 700&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have discovered a hidden feature in the item!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Insight has increased by 10.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I had used the Legendary Blacksmith’s Appraisal skill dozens of times so far. But it was the first time I found a hidden feature.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Interesting... And my insight stat went up by 10 points at once!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I clenched both fists with joy. On the other hand, the guild members were surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? Vantner’s axe has suddenly changed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hasn’t it changed shape? No?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">While the guild members were surprised, Vantner was nervous.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“D-Did anything go wrong with the repairing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If a blacksmith lacked the skill to repair an item, the maximum durability of the item would permanently drop.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Vantner was concerned about this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was he trying to hurt my pride?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What does he see me as...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How could a legendary blacksmith fail in item repairing?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Also, the repairing hasn’t even started yet.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I started to heat up Vantner’s axe.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Chiik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Repeated quenching, tempering, and forging.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The heated axe was reborn anew.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Vantner was nervous as he watched me hammering without speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">30 minutes later.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After using the grindstone, the Genuine Twin Bloody Axes were fully restored.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I passed them to Vantner and...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heooook!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner freaked out as he examined his transformed axes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Vantner?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner’s exclamation confused the guild members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka, who had been watching the situation, asked with wide eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is the fuss?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner responded to her in a trembling voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“T-That... I don’t understand... L-Look for yourself...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner shared the information of the item with the guild members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The guild members were shocked as they verified the information.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The item has changed? This is nonsense!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">All of a sudden, loud noises were heard from Khan’s smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'What is the fuss? Huhut...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I dug at my ears while Jishuka came up to me and asked,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid! What kind of magic is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Magic? What magic?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I stared straight into her shining, ruby-red eyes and said,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is all skill.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A legendary skill that only I could use in Satisfy.</span></p>
