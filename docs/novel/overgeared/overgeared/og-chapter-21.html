 <p><span style="">Chapter 21</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">After breakfast, my parents immediately headed towards the vegetable store that they ran.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The two of them normally left at 5 a.m, so they were quite late today.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘They are late because of breakfast with their son.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I suddenly felt that tsunami of emotions again as tears filled my eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the first time my stomach felt so full in a while.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I sat on the couch and dozed off, before waking up because of Sehee.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sehee had changed into her school uniform and looked like a neat schoolgirl.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was my sister, but I had to admit that she was beautiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? Why are you looking at me like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m glad to see you. You grew up well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What are you saying all of a sudden!?” Sehee flushed red before hitting my forearm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What? Did I do something wrong? But what is this cool feeling?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I felt some relief in the area that Sehee had hit. It was like a massage!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ahh, good! Hit me more! More! Keep hitting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kyaaak! Pervert!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Slap!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">...Why did she slap me all of a sudden?&nbsp;</span><span style="">I placed a hand on my tingling cheek as Sehee shouted, “I've filled up the tub with hot water. Then your body will feel better. This perverted Oppa!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah, eh, yes...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She was someone who got angry at me but always took care of me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘But why am I a pervert?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee headed to school while I soaked in the hot water.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“My fatigue is going away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then after a few moments...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I exited the bathroom and paid the loan interest through a direct account transfer. It was hard to bear seeing the money from my blood and sweat disappear before my eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh... This world is hell...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I needed stability.&nbsp;</span><span style="">So, I hurriedly entered the capsule and connected to Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘How much have the arrows sold for?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Login.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jiing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The capsule’s door closed, and my field of view slowly turned black. Then the familiar system voice and music entered my eyes, then my vision brightened again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The air is good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I appeared in a place which reminded me of a charming village in medieval Europe and immediately stated a command, “Status window.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Name: Grid&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level: 3 (75/500)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Class: Pagma’s Descendant</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The probability of adding additional options when making items will increase.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The probably of item enhancement will increase.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* All equipment items can be worn unconditionally.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">&nbsp;However, there is a penalty depending on the rating of the item.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Title: One who Became a Legend</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Abnormal conditions don’t work well for you.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* You won’t die when health is at the minimum.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Easily acknowledged.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Health: 336/336 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana: 87/87</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Strength: 24 + 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 22 &nbsp;&nbsp;Agility: 16 &nbsp;Intelligence: 29&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dexterity: 55 &nbsp;Persistence: 21</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Composure: 14 &nbsp;Indomitable: 16 &nbsp;&nbsp;Dignity: 14 &nbsp;&nbsp;Insight: 14</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Stat Points: 60</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 3,095/1,000</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The weight limit exceeds 200%, so movement speed is reduced by 100%.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The body is heavy and cannot exert any power properly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The probability of receiving the ‘weakened’ state has become really high.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Level 3... Huhu, is that really the case?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My stats had increased by making an epic rated item. Considering the 60 stat points which I hadn’t used yet, I was actually around level 26.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If I equipped Mamon’s Greatsword and Mengel’s Plate Armor, I could demonstrate the combat power of a level 50.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is this the feeling of superiority that only a special person can feel? Huhuhut...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In a square filled with people, I forgot the harshness of reality as I talked excitedly to myself. </span><span style="">Then with one hand on my hip, I laughed like the protagonist of a movie.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The women passing by sent me dirty looks and gossiped with each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is with that person? Striking such a strange pose and laughing while talking to himself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is he on an ego trip? Perhaps he has the prince disease?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“He is ugly. He probably doesn’t have a lover.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Normally, I would be unhappy, but right now, I was so thrilled that I didn’t care about the gazes of others.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I ignored what they were saying and checked the experience of my various skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill] Lv 1 (3.7%)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath] Lv 1 (2.0%)&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I’d thought it would take longer for the experience of these skills to rise.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is it thanks to making an epic item?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I headed to the auction house with a light heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As usual, the auction house was bustling with people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I wonder what the winning bid is...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The price for one Jaffa Arrow was six silver. However, the Jaffa Arrows I’d made had an epic rating! I expected the price to be 3~4 times higher.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the case of general equipment items, it was reasonable to calculate that rare-rated items would be three times more expensive than normal items, while epic items would be seven times more expensive than normal items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, I soon became worried.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Would even a rich user want to spend so much money buying arrows?&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the first place, consumables were cheap compared to equipment items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Yes, don’t expect too much.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I opened the auction window while thinking that I would be satisfied if they sold for double the price.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“K-Keok...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After confirming the bidding price of the Jaffa Arrows, I couldn’t shut my mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Meanwhile, I could hear the voices of the women looking at me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Isn’t he that person laughing to himself in the square? Oh. my. What is he doing now? His mouth has fallen open.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kyaaak~! His saliva is dripping! Nasty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugly... He must have no lover.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Argh… Uhhh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I tried to shut my mouth, but it wasn’t easy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Special Jaffa Arrow] (99 Pieces)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Bid Price: 72 silver per piece.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It sold for 12 times the price of ordinary Jaffa Arrows!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh...uh...aack...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I touched the inventory with trembling hands, then I took out the calculator which was a default item provided to all users.&nbsp;</span><span style="">99×72=?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...7,128...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">100 silver was 1 gold.&nbsp;</span><span style="">7,128 silver meant 71 gold and 28 silver.&nbsp;</span><span style="">For reference, 100 gold was worth around 120,000 won in cash.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Didn’t I create 100 arrows in around a day?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was approximately a day in game time. If I calculated it in real time, I’d earned around 84,000 won in less than six hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ha...hahaha...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was thrilled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Uncontrollable laughter emerged from my mouth, “Puhahahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“T-That person has finally gone mad!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugly! He definitely doesn’t have a lover! His mother must be the only female contact in his phone.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">‘Cough,</span></i><span style=""> do their words have to be so sharp?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No, I wouldn’t be shaken by these females.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Talk in your hearts.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At this moment, I could still smile even while hearing such shameful words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can see a definite way.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Debt?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will pay it back in the game!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was no need to go find labor jobs. It was more profitable to make money from the items I create in the game.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Indeed, Pagma’s Descendant was definitely a goose that lay golden eggs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I formed a fist and shivered, while the auctioneer at the counter handed me gold and silver coins.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, why was the amount of money lacking?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why are you only giving me 60 gold and 59 silver?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The auction house manager smiled at my question.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The amount is limited to 10 gold and 69 silver because of the sales commission. There is a 15% sales commission for epic rated items. Thank you for using our service.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The commission fee was 8% for normal rated items and 10% for rare rated items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Compared to that, the sales commission for epic rated items was too expensive.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘How much is the commission fee for unique or legendary rated items?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Suddenly, the auction house and Mother’s Heart is Happy seemed to overlap.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Exploitation was the same in reality and in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shit... I will become a successful person who exploits the weak...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I would produce legendary items which weren’t possible for anyone else except Pagma’s Descendant!&nbsp;</span><span style="">The two billion users in Satisfy would be overwhelmed!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“But that is a story for the distant future. Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tears flowed as I thought about the 15% commission. This was because the day before, I hadn’t been able to open a stall because I’d needed to go work, so I had decided to use the auction house.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Once I got the money, I thought about whether I should take the carriage to Winston Village or not.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can stay here and make a lot of money with the Jaffa Arrows, so do I really need to move villages?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was trying to move villages because I wanted to find a suitable hunting ground.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, I didn’t need to cling to hunting and leveling up, when I could make a profit by making items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It would be good to just stay here and make items all the time...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, there was one thing I had to consider.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the fact that Smith was gay!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If I stay here alone with him... Just imagining it was terrible.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I wasn’t in a hurry to hunt now, but I would be more comfortable living in a village suitable for my level.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, I decided to move to Winston as planned and headed towards the carriages. Just like last time, I started negotiating the price while armed with the saddest stories.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“My ailing sister is waiting for me in Winston Village...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oh, no! Then I will leave one hour early. Climb into my carriage!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“But right now, I only have seven gold...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oh, I thought you were a customer with a reservation. I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My first bargaining attempt failed!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“My grandmother died the day before I was born, and her death anniversary is today. I needed to go to Winston Village right now, but I only have 7 gold and 50 silver...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Um, I want to help you because of your high reputation and your situation, but it is too much of a loss to visit Winston VIllage for 7 gold and 50 silver. I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My second bargaining attempt failed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the same as humans constantly stepping on other humans.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You should give me a choco pie, ah, these people. You should realize that we are all the same!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the end, I failed to negotiate the price I wanted, but I got on the carriage that was the cheapest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let’s depart for Winston. It should be a quick and safe trip, considering the money I paid. And be friendly! You should show full hospitality.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...I will be very grateful if you didn’t talk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Travelling always made people excited.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The bumpy carriage ride and the unfriendly attitude of the coachman were bad, but my mood was good.</span></p>
