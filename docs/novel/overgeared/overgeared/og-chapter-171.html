 <p><span style="">Chapter 171</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura controlled her base with Dark Storm and continued by using magic that combined two attributes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dark Lightning."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pachik!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pachichik!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the level of a natural disaster.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dark clouds formed in the sky and lightning poured all over the place.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The forest burned and the ground crumbled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">An excited commentator shouted as he watched the series of exploding targets.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 38, 39, 40...! 45! 46! The South Korean team! 46 points! It’s an unmatched speed! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Waaahhhhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The spectators were baffled by the unrealistic sight, but they finally woke up from their silence.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was such a huge shout that it seemed like the earth shaking would be transmitted to North Korea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka shook her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It's like looking at Neberius. That magic power and casting speed is already beyond the level of a player. As the Eighth Servant, she’s like a boss monster.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Samuel was nervous.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"The other teams are going to attack Yura. Shouldn’t we join as well? If you add support with your shooting, won’t Yura be defeated?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka scoffed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"It’s a stupid thing to do.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kkirik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka’s bow aimed for the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A dazzling quick fire was unfolded.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pa pa pa pa pak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The small targets flying at a speed of 40m per second were pierced by arrows at once.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The focus moved from Yura to Jishuka.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The crowd screamed with delight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The continuously fired arrows exploded the targets. It was truly the majesty of an expert archer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The Brazil team, 13 points! 14 points! 15 points! They are continuing to raise the score while the other teams are focusing on Yura! Ah! As soon as I spoke, the US team, the French team, the Chinese team and the Japanese team have started to quickly score points. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Someone needed to contain Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there was no need for it to be their team.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the wise decision made by some countries, including the United States, France and Brazil.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The teams acting to stop Yura were trash. They would become the scapegoats.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Dammit!"&nbsp;</span><span style="">A member of the Spanish national team, Med, cursed while rushing towards Yura with other teams.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The other teams were sucking honey while they had to control Yura?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The scores weren’t climbing quickly, but it was still burdensome.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Would it be better for us to focus on the targets now?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The representatives were troubled, but it was too late to return.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They couldn’t step back now.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, eight teams, including the Spanish team, continued to assault Yura.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Peng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The dark magic bombardment continued.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura’s ability to control her magic power to attack the players and deal with the targets was indeed first-rate.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The crowd and players’ mouths were wide open, while the commentators were drooling while praising her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But she wasn’t the only special one.&nbsp;</span><span style="">All the people participating in the National Competition were influential people who represented their country.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, the top rankers had a high participation rate in events that emphasized individual combat ability like target processing and PvP.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was only one person below the top 80 of the unified rankings. It was Jishuka’s partner, Samuel.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The players used powerful defense skills or the features of the land to neutralize Yura’s magic as much as possible, and quickly narrowed the distance to her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura was somewhat surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'They’re more talented than I thought.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If her fast paced operation failed, it would inevitably drag into a long battle.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura had no hope when she was alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘In the end... Should I give up?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura had been interviewed by foreign media as a representative of South Korea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The foreign interviewers always said that she was the ‘only hope of a declining South Korea.’ Was it possible for another talented person like Yura to be born in South Korea? There were also questions about whether she was secretly supported by the South Korean government and S.A. Group.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura didn’t like the foreigners who disregarded the country that she was born and grew up in.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was almost like instinct.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She never thought that her patriotism was special, but it was unacceptable for foreigners to treat her country like this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She wanted to make them look at South Korea again through this National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was too much for her alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A man fell down in front of her while she was making a gloomy expression.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He appeared splendidly from the tree tops.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Regas, the British representative.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What are 16 men and women doing against one woman?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hah, don’t be stupid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas’ partner, Natasha had a headache.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Med gritted his teeth,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Regas! Do you still not understand the situation? If you help Yura, then South Korea will receive a gold medal! Leave your cheap justice aside for a moment!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cheap justice?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Regas’ usually mild face stiffened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Why are you treating my martial path cheaply?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One month ago, Regas finally surpassed Jishuka and reached 12th on the unified rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had the nickname of Taekwon Master at an early age, and he flew like a butterfly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pak!</span></i> <i><span style="">Papat!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pa pa pa pat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The kick combo of a former Taekwondo gold medalist hit Med.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The brilliant attack pierced him like an awl.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Koreans in the audience cheered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Taekwondo!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Indeed, Regas! Show them the dignity of Taekwondo!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas was a famous british person, and he appeared with perfect timing to save Yura, looking as beautiful as a main character from a movie.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Not just the Korean and British audiences, the spectators from other countries started to support him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Med’s group was well aware of how good Regas was.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Med wasn’t a villain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was just doing what he had to.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can hold on.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Med was a 33rd ranked monk, so he didn’t fall easily to Regas’ powerful and brutal attacks. He stood firm and shouted to his companions,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Leave this guy to me and get Yura! Hurry and finish up here, then we need to keep the United States and France in check!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The eight teams had no choice but to join hands, and they had 15 members if Med was excluded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Regas was worried that Yura would be hit by them and used a lightning aura.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The golden aura knocked down Med’s iron body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Keeok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Med coughed up blood and fell down.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have been hit by a lethal blow!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 10,900 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“T-This guy...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Med hurriedly took a potion and fought back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Regas naturally turned to avoid the attack and kicked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The kick enhanced by lightning hit Med’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 4,800 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was over.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was a flurry of strikes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 4,350 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Force Palm.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 9,200 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Med couldn’t even moan as he coughed up blood. Then he tumbled down the hill to avoid Yura’s magic bombardment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Damn bastard...!” </span></p>
 <p><span style="">Unlike the paladins, a monk didn’t serve any of the three main religions. He served a local god, Boris, whose name was very weak compared to the three great religions who had temples scattered all over the continent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Due to that, Med had to go to a crumbling village in a corner of the continent to change into a monk. He even had to visit that temple every time he wanted to learn new skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That wasn’t the only downside to being a monk.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unlike the paladins, they couldn’t wear heavy &nbsp;armor. They also couldn’t use swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The only defense they wore were clothes made of cloth. The only weapon they could use was a club, which had weak attack power and slow attack speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Therefore, it was hard to raise a monk.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a class that most users avoided.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Reverse Origin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your health has been fully restored.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your damaged body has been reversed to its original state.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You will suffer a continuous decline in health. This effect won’t stop until your health is at the minimum.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Origin Opportunity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You can temporarily redistribute your stats. Please set them.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Invest my intelligence, indomitable, persistence and luck points into agility.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Intelligence, indomitable, persistence and luck have fallen to 1 point. Your agility stat is now at 2,137 points.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A monk was a religious class, but the concept was different from a paladin or priest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were pilgrims who walked the path of suffering.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They always had to sacrifice something in order to obtain something.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The rewards were great, depending on what they gave up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ohhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 1st ranked monk, Med, climbed the hill and was clearly different than before.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The world watched one of the few monk users.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The power of his club aimed at the Taekwon Master.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ku tang tang tang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas fell and hurriedly raised his body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He spoke with amazement,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"You, isn’t your recovery quite fast?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If a martial artist trains their martial arts, a monk trains their body. I have patiently built it up, so it won’t fall so easily. I will never fall down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was shameful to attack a woman with a lot of people?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Don’t make me laugh.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was a battlefield. It was unreasonable and hypocritical to look at the opponent’s situation when fighting.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I am a Spanish representative and have received the expectations of my people.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Countries got fired up even over an unpopular event, let alone Satisfy that one third of the world’s population enjoyed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The sense of weight on him was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As long as he was the representative, he had to do his best.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Med was filled with a fighting spirit as he attacked Regas.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He knew that his opponent was stronger than him, but he didn’t want to show weakness when representing his country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">He struggled with Regas while the remaining 15 people intensively attacked Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is annoying.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas’ partner Natasha was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She didn’t help Yura because she wasn’t the type of person to forget her duty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">She settled in a safe place and started concentrating on destroying the targets.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura faced 15 enemies alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her relaxed expression had long been lost.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an obvious story but the tickets for the National Competition had been sold out several months ago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Youngwoo entered the Olympic Stadium without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You can’t enter if you can’t prove your identity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The guarded blocked Youngwoo’s way.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Do you mean this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo pulled out the ID card he received in the mail a few days ago. Then the path opened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was able to easily enter the corridor to the participants’ waiting rooms and he headed straight to the Brazilian waiting room.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Jishuka wasn’t there.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She appeared on a large monitor in the waiting room.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is it the target processing?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo’s expression slowly distorted as he looked at the monitor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He realized that Yura was alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Foolish girl.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was annoying.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was she trying to make him look bad?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why did you put a person who didn’t want to participate on the list? A persistent and selfish woman. Ah, look at this.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo sat down in a gap between the Brazilian players.&nbsp;</span>Nobody cared about him. Everybody was busy watching the monitor.</p>
 <p><span style="">『 Player Yura is in a crisis! The representatives of eight countries have started to focus their attacks on her. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The 15 people are strong. At least six of the users are in the top 30 rankings. It is frustrating. South Korea's only hope is crashing down. 』&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Ahh...! They struggled against Yura’s overwhelming ability, but now she is allowing some attacks...! 』&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 A magician’s defense and health is very low. Once they allow an attack, they will collapse rapidly. This must hurt. Yura was the person most likely to win a medal in the target processing... As many people have predicted, it seems that South Korea won’t be able to make any achievements in the national competition. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 This is the reality of South Korea. They are trying to regain their past reputation as powerhouses in the game, but it’s just an illusion. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 As soon as I spoke, Player Yura has allowed another attack. Now she’s reaching her limit. It’s over when she collapses. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo’s expression gradually stiffened as he looked at the monitor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, the Brazilian players were laughing while watching.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Annoying.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He didn’t like it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was it because he experienced years of being crushed by the strong while alone, without a friend?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Recently, Youngwoo had felt the desire to help when he saw the weak being trampled on by the strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At this moment, the weak existences were Yura and South Korea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was confusing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In his childhood, he didn’t understand the heroes who unconditionally helped others and he empathized with realistic villains. But now he felt a sense of heterogeneity in himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Didn’t I promise that I would live as a solitary self-centred person when I succeeded? Then why is this happening now? Huh? Shin Youngwoo.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">When he was going through tough times.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Other people didn’t help him. Rather, they turned away and felt disgusted by him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now that other people needed his help?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t have a reason to do so.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah, I don’t know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He didn’t know why, but he couldn’t stay still.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He eventually got up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he rationalized to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Won’t I gain money if I win a medal in the National Competition? It was 200 million won for one gold medal?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That wasn’t all.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Korean government had promised special benefits to the players if the team came at least in third place.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Yes, it’s because of that.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That was why he was going out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t because he was a hero.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t feel sorry for Yura who was facing the enemies all alone. He wasn’t the type.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then what? Did he dislike seeing the foreigners laughing at South Korea?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was for his own self-interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That thought eased his mind.</span></p>
