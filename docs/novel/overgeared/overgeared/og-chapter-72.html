 <p><span>Chapter 72</span></p>

 <p><span>Winston.</span></p>
 <p><span>After killing the frostlight orc chieftain, I returned to Khan’s smithy and checked the item information again.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Frostlight Orc Chief’s Helmet]</span></p>
 <p><span>Rating: Unique (Set)</span></p>
 <p><span>Durability: 250/250 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 130</span></p>
 <p><span>* The chance of suffering a critical blow is reduced by 20%.</span></p>
 <p><span>* Health will increase by 10%.</span></p>
 <p><span>* Has a certain chance to cast fear on the target.</span></p>
 <p><span>* Frostlight Orc Chief’s set effect:&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>-3 set items equipped: Strength +50, stamina +80.</span></p>
 <p><span>-5 set items equipped: Strength +100, stamina +200, can transform into the frostlight orc chief.</span></p>
 <p><span>*Frostlight Orc Chief’s transformation:</span></p>
 <p><span>-It is possible to command the frostlight orcs.</span></p>
 <p><span>-The skill ‘Rotation Cut’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span>The frostlight orc chief can be described as the ruler of the northern snowfields. This helmet, which he loved, was made from the skull of a snowy ogre and has a terrible appearance. In the particular, the horn on the left has a very threatening appearance. Just wearing this helmet can cause fear.</span></p>
 <p><span>Conditions of Use: Level 150 or more. More than 400 strength.</span></p>
 <p><span>Weight: 800</span></p>
 <p><span>[Red Lightning Summoning Bead]</span></p>
 <p><span>The power of a frostlight orc shaman dwells in this bead.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Can summon red lightning from the sky. Temporarily increases the attack power of the weapon struck by this lightning bolt and gives the weapon an electrical attribute.</span></p>
 <p><span>* It takes one minute to summon the lightning bolt, and the summoner’s health will drop by 10% after each summoning.</span></p>
 <p><span>Weight: 50&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>It was tremendous.&nbsp;</span><span>If these two items were placed on the auction site, the prices would skyrocket.</span></p>
 <p><span>“There is also the blessed weapon enhancement stones...”</span></p>
 <p><span>[Blessed Weapon Enhancement Stones]</span></p>
 <p><span>A magic stone used to enhance weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span>The successful enhancement of a weapon will increase the enhancement value by +1.</span></p>
 <p><span>The failed enhancement of a weapon will decrease the enhancement value by -1.</span></p>
 <p><span>Weight: 20</span></p>
 <p><span>[Blessed Armor Enhancement Stones]</span></p>
 <p><span>A magic stone used to enhance armor.</span></p>
 <p><span>The successful enhancement of an armor will increase the enhancement value by +1.</span></p>
 <p><span>The failed enhancement of a armor will decrease the enhancement value by -1.</span></p>
 <p><span>Weight: 20&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>In Satisfy, items could be enhanced up to +10.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>However, the price of the enhancement stones were expensive, and the higher the enhancement value, the lower the probability of the enhancement succeeding.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>In addition, if the enhancement was successful, the enhancement value would be +1. But if it failed, it would be -3, so the chances of ordinary users owning high enhanced equipment was like picking stars from the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>But in the case of the blessed enhancement stones, the drop was -1 instead of -3 if an enhancement failed.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This is really a scam... In general, failing an enhancement will decrease it by 3, but the blessed enhancement stones is just -1? The burden will be very small if the enhancement fails.”</span></p>
 <p><span>This was the first time I knew that blessed enhancement stones existed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>‘But aren’t high level users already familiar with the blessed enhancement stones?’</span></p>
 <p><span>The high level users, especially the rankers, often moved around with +6 or higher items.&nbsp;</span><span>I always wondered about their secret, and it turned out that it was the blessed enhancement stones.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Should I strengthen the Ideal Dagger?”</span></p>
 <p><span>In the end, I didn’t manage to obtain 20 sylphid scales. Therefore, it wasn’t possible to make the Hooded Zip Up at the moment, and I couldn’t avoid fighting the monsters in Kesan Canyon.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Right now, I am level 85, but...’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Just based on the sum of my stats, I was comparable to users over level 100. However, that was just when looking at my stats. Due to the lack of combat skills, I was still afraid of the monsters in Kesan Canyon.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I only have four combat related skills. I can easily deal with the frostlight orcs, but the monsters in the canyon are different from the orcs. I wonder if I can deal with the monsters in the canyon with only four skills?’</span></p>
 <p><span>There was only one thing I could depend on.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Yes, let’s strengthen the Ideal Dagger.”</span></p>
 <p><span>One of the characteristics of Pagma's Descendant is that I had an increased probability of item enhancement.&nbsp;</span><span>There was no explanation on what percentage it was increased by, but considering that Pagma’s Descendant was a legendary class, the increase probably wouldn’t be small.</span></p>
 <p><span>I decided to head to the auction house immediately. Then I searched for weapon and armor enhancement stones.</span></p>
 <p><span>'Weapon and armor enhancement stones are 100 gold... and the blessed weapon and armour enhancement stones are 1,200 gold each...!’</span></p>
 <p><span>The blessed enhancement stones were 12 times more expensive than ordinary enhancement stones.&nbsp;</span><span>But didn’t I acquire five blessed enhancement stones by killing one orc chief?</span></p>
 <p><span>'Just the price of the five blessed enhancement stones is 7,200,000 won... In addition, there is the unique helmet, the lightning bolt summoning bead and the sylphid scales... How much was that orc chief worth?’</span></p>
 <p><span>When a raid was conducted by multiple people, the value of the dropped items had to be divided equally among the party members, so it wasn’t easy to make a big amount of money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>But I did the raid with Huroi and made a lot of money because I picked up all the items myself.</span></p>
 <p><span>I was proud that I had no conscience, but I couldn’t help feeling some remorse.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Should I share some of this big money with Huroi?’</span></p>
 <p><span>The raid had succeeded due to Huroi’s sacrifice. He consumed the firebombs and potions, and he also lost experience when he died. I would really be the worst person if I didn’t distribute any items to him.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Kuk... the worst person... It is true!”</span></p>
 <p><span>In the first place, he obtained his second class thanks to me. The grace that he owed me was incomprehensible.&nbsp;</span><span>I didn’t need to give anything to him. Rather, he was in a position to serve me.&nbsp;</span><span>In the end, I took all the items as originally planned.&nbsp;</span><span>Then I purchased 10 weapon enhancement stones and returned to Khan’s smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was early in the morning.&nbsp;</span><span>Khan woke up and greeted me.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Ohh! Grid! I was so worried about you! I’m glad to see you looking well!”</span></p>
 <p><span>"There is nothing to worry about. The orcs weren’t even my opponents.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Khan ignored my smile. Then he looked at the spoils that I laid on the table.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Doesn’t this helmet look terrible? Is it made from an ogre’s skull? The appearance is ugly, but its defense is quite good. Um? What is this bead? I can feel a mysterious aura but it is hard to determine... Ohh! Are these the sylphid scales that I’ve only heard about? How will you use this to create an item? I have no clue. Eh? No, this?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Khan let out successive cries of admiration before his eyes widened at the leather of the frostlight orcs. He thought about it and said.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I really like this type of resilient leather material. If used as inner armor, it can fully absorb the impact to the exterior armor.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Khan seemed to have come up with a good idea.&nbsp;</span><span>I handed him the frostlight orc leather.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This is a gift. Instead, I want you to give me armor made from this leather.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"...Won’t I damage it?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“If you don’t want it, then it can’t be helped. The frostlight orc leather... such a difficult and rare material... When will there be another chance to make an item with such precious materials...?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Did I say no? Okay, okay! Leave this leather to me! I will make great armor!”</span></p>
 <p><span>I passed on the armor production to Khan and took out the Ideal Dagger and weapon enhancement stones.&nbsp;</span><span>Then I attempted to enhance the Ideal Dagger.</span></p>
 <p><span>[The weapon enhancement stone (1) has been consumed.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The Ideal Dagger has been strengthened.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[+1 Ideal Dagger]</span></p>
 <p><span>Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span>Durability: 168/168 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 254~277 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Speed: +11%</span></p>
 <p><span>* There is a rare chance of instantaneously killing the target.</span></p>
 <p><span>* Agility +20</span></p>
 <p><span>* The skill ‘Wind Blast’ is generated.</span></p>
 <p><span>* The skill ‘Quick Movements’ is generated.</span></p>
 <p><span>A dagger created by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but lacks experience and reputation. It was made with the renowned blacksmith Khan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>There is nothing special about the materials or method used, but the craftsman’s skill and the co-operation with Khan has created an ideal dagger.</span></p>
 <p><span>User Restriction: Level 180 or higher. More than 450 agility.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Advanced Dagger Mastery.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Ohh!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Every time an item was enhanced by +1, the basic stats were increased by 5%.&nbsp;</span><span>The original damage of 242~264 increased to 254~277.</span></p>
 <p><span>"The basic attack power is good, so the rise is too big!”</span></p>
 <p><span>I continued to enhance the item.</span></p>
 <p><span>[The weapon enhancement stone (1) has been consumed.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The +1 Ideal Dagger has been strengthened.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The weapon enhancement stone (1) has been consumed.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The +2 Ideal Dagger has been strengthened.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The weapon enhancement stone (1) has been consumed.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The +3 Ideal Dagger has been strengthened.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The weapon enhancement stone (1) has been consumed.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The +4 Ideal Dagger has been strengthened.]</span></p>
 <p><span>“I’ve finally reached here...”</span></p>
 <p><span>[+5 Ideal Dagger]</span></p>
 <p><span>Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span>Durability: 168/168 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 309~337 &nbsp;Attack Speed: +11%</span></p>
 <p><span>* There is a rare chance of instantaneously killing the target.</span></p>
 <p><span>* Agility +20</span></p>
 <p><span>* The skill ‘Wind Blast’ is generated.</span></p>
 <p><span>* The skill ‘Quick Movements’ is generated.</span></p>
 <p><span>A dagger created by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but lacks experience and reputation. It was made with the renowned blacksmith Khan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>There is nothing special about the materials or method used, but the craftsman’s skill and the co-operation with Khan has created an ideal dagger.</span></p>
 <p><span>User Restriction: Level 180 or higher. More than 450 agility.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Advanced Dagger Mastery.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Items had a relatively high probability of being enhanced to +5.&nbsp;</span><span>Therefore, there wasn’t a big difference in price between +0 items and +5 items.&nbsp;</span><span>The problem was enhancing it to +6.</span></p>
 <p><span>The probability of enhancement was greatly reduced from +6 onwards, so ordinary users rarely had a +6 item.&nbsp;</span><span>From +6 onwards, the stats had a basic increase of +7% instead of +5%, and the item’s appearance improved, making it worth the risk and challenge.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Please... please succeed!”</span></p>
 <p><span>I believed in the characteristic of Pagma’s Descendant and challenged the +6 enhancement.&nbsp;</span><span>And!</span></p>
 <p><span>[A weapon enhancement stone (1) has been consumed.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[You have failed to strengthen the +5 Ideal Dagger.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The +5 Ideal Dagger has decreased by 3.]</span></p>
 <p><span>“...Hey you. This really #@!%$...”</span></p>
 <p><span>It was like when I kept creating normal rated items despite being Pagma’s Descendant.&nbsp;</span><span>I once again felt frustration at my class.</span></p>
 <p><span>“No, didn’t it say the probability of item enhancement would increase? Then why can’t I get to +6?”</span></p>
