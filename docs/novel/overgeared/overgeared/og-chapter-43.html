 <p><span style="">Chapter 43</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">'These damn f**kers.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was arrested before the quest succeeded and dragged to Winston Castle. It had already been an hour since I was trapped in an interrogation room.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Several people witnessed you talking to Huroi in front of Khan’s smithy. Did you already know that Huroi was planning to contact Earl Steim?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"So what if I knew?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...It was a resident of Winston who entrusted Huroi to contact Earl Steim. Since you are close to the residents, don’t you know who that person is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“So what if I know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Then aren’t you one of them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No? Are you stupid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I made a much better dagger than that girl called Erina. In other words, the quest to make an item was going to end with my victory and I would’ve earned 600 gold.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, due to this unreasonable arrest, the quest had failed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to these bastards, my 720,000 won had flown away!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I don’t think you know what position you’re in... If you continue to be so carefree, you will regret it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I talked back to the knight who was trying to intimidate me.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Shut up, you rotten bastard. Are you a comedian now? I want you to lose your heads immediately. I have no connection with Huroi. So let me out right now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I knew that I could be tortured and locked up in prison, or killed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But I was the incarnation of anger after losing my 720,000 won.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘How many bowls of mackerel is 720,000 won?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was so angry that I spat curses at the knights.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"You ridiculous jerk! I will remember all of this, Ugly! One day I will return to squeeze 600 gold out of you, so release me now."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Look at this guy. He keeps talking nonsense!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The youngest knight pulled out his sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I flinched, but soon changed my attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kill me, you motherfu*ker.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This rascal isn’t scared until the end!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The knight couldn’t stand it anymore and rushed forward.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I closed my eyes and accepted death.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why? In this situation, it was better to die.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If I die, I will be resurrected in the square. I can’t stay stuck here. It is better to die and resurrect, even if it means losing experience.'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was concerned about Khan. In the worst case scenario, I wasn’t the presumed winner so the Mero Company would obtain the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If so, Khan would die. The class quest I received would naturally be destroyed!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kill me quickly, you son of a b*tch!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I couldn’t log out here. I had to die, resurrect and meet Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then a quick-witted middle aged knight came forward and stopped the hasty young knight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hey Leo, calm down. Aren’t you aware of it? He has an immortal body. Killing him will just release him into the field."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dammit, this plan failed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I kept provoking the young knight, hoping he would lose his temper.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hey, you aren’t going to kill me? You can’t kill me? Are you scared? What type of knight are you? &nbsp;You pathetic bastard, can’t you eat chili? You will die a bachelor! If you die, you will become a ghost. A ghost who peeps at girls taking a bath!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh...y-you...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The young knight called Leo’s hands shook as he held his sword. It wouldn’t be strange if he stabbed me right away.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Leo refrained from attacking me. He bit his lip so hard that blood emerged.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It would work if I insulted him a bit more.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This... oof? Oof!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I tried to provoke Leo further, but somebody shut me up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘These rotten, lousy bastards!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I glared at the middle-aged knight who gagged me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You have no intention of admitting to the crime you are accused of. You also have no intention of telling us who commissioned Huroi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oof oof!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If you want me to answer, then take off the gag. The middle-aged knight nodded as he interpreted my answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You really won’t answer? If so, I have no choice but to imprison you. But if you tell me who commissioned Huroi, you might be treated differently.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I didn’t want to get stuck in prison. The imprisonment wouldn’t just last a few days. Until I was released, I would continue to be imprisoned, no matter how much I disconnected and reconnected.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can tell them. If Khan gets arrested, I can find a way to rescue him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan was invaluable to me in Satisfy and reality, since he was a precious friend. He might be an NPC, but he was a friend.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But a friend was just a friend!&nbsp;</span><span style="">No matter how important a friend was, my life was more important.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I decided to give Khan up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ooof! Oof!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I will tell you who commissioned Huroi! So release me. The middle-aged knight nodded as he interpreted my answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What a great guy. You have no intention of selling out your friend, even when you will be locked up in prison? You might be weak, but your sense of justice is admirable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oof oof! Oooooup!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was he saying? I will tell you who commissioned Huroi if you release this gag. The middle-aged knight nodded as he arbitrarily interpreted my reply and ordered the soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Imprison him. Put him in solitary confinement.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">S-Solitary?!&nbsp;</span><span style="">I couldn’t do anything if I was stuck in prison, but solitary confinement as well? I would be trapped alone without any other prisoners.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oof! Ooooof!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I panicked and struggled to get rid of the gag. However, the knights ignored my calls.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, I was dragged underneath the castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Damn, what the hell is going on? I have to be imprisoned forever? And what happened with Khan’s smithy? Khan absolutely can’t die... No, that stupid Huroi, why did you fail your quest and damage me...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It happened while I was being dragged by the soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The quest ‘Apostle of Justice’ has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Apostle of Justice]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Difficulty: S</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi, who was trying to inform Earl Steim about the happenings in Winston, failed his mission and was caught.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He has been locked in solitary confinement for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You are the only one who knows Huroi’s circumstances, so you are the only one who can help!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rescue Huroi for the sake of justice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Conditions: After being trapped in the deepest dungeon, rescue Huroi within seven hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Reward: The title ‘Apostle of Justice.’ Affinity with the Winston residents will rise to the peak. Reputation in Winston will rise to the peak. Create a linked quest with Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">*Apostle of Justice: The ‘Courage’ stat will be opened. All stats +10. The skill ‘Unbreakable Justice’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Failure: Level -2. The title ‘Coward’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Coward: Affinity with NPCs will decline. The probability of acquiring quests will decline.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You will be despised by NPCs with a positive inclination.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The contents of the reward are familiar? Ah!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the same compensation when Huroi shared the information of the ‘For the Residents of Winston’ with me. A linked quest with Huroi was generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I am greedy for a new title.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">B.U.T. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have no intention of accepting the quest!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was going to be stuck in solitary confinement, yet I was expected to rescue Huroi? In addition, it had to be within seven hours!&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an unconditional quest failure. ‘What fool would be stupid enough to accept this quest?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The penalty if I fail the quest... I have goosebumps. My level would drop and I would receive the Coward title? It is a junk title.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The ‘Coward’ title was just as bad as ‘Noble Killer.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">I could never accept this quest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You can’t refuse this quest. Quest is in progress.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why me?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oof! Ohh! Ohhhhhh! Ohhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was going nuts. I couldn’t help cursing despite the gag in my mouth, almost choking me.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I drooled and coughed through the gag in my mouth, causing the soldiers escorting me to hit me on the back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This bastard! Can’t you be quiet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Bah! Solitary confinement is scary. Stupid guy, you should’ve talked when the knights gave you a chance. Why are you pretending to be cool when you’re just afraid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oof! Ooof!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I thought it wasn’t fair. It was frustrating to see the soldiers misunderstand and talk so arbitrarily.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ouch!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was brought deep underground and pushed by the soldiers into the solitary confinement cell.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But they didn’t release my gag.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The soldiers talked amongst themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hey, should we release the gag?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Leo told me to only release it at meals. Apparently he has quite a mouth, so Leo will be tempted to kill him if his mouth is free.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was this?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oof! Ooof!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Release the gag! Eh? The soldiers looked at me with terrified expressions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Wow, he is so desperate to talk that saliva is dripping down. If we keep him gagged all day, his blood pressure might rise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is really a punishment for him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ooof! Ooooof!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then release this rope! The rope was pressing against my body, making it difficult to move my fingers.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The soldiers ignored me and walked away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘They really are leaving.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My body was tied up and my was mouth gagged. Would I be trapped in this smelly place forever?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Furthermore, time was running out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Huroi rescue quest would fail even if I just stood still.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What about my level?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">And why did I have to get the ‘Coward’ title?&nbsp;</span><span style="">I had to be called a coward because I couldn’t rescue Huroi?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ooof! Ooooof!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I started shouting again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Please help me.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there was no answer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">My moaning echoed in the deep and dismal basement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Time passed with nothing happening.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At the top of the screen, there was a window showing that I had four hours left in my quest time limit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I had been trapped in jail for three hours already.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Shit.. this rotten...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Somehow, both good luck and bad luck followed me recently.&nbsp;</span><span style="">All that luck was a precursor to my misfortune today.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I forgot how unlucky I am and wasn’t vigilant...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was someone who had never found a 10 won coin on the side of the road in my 26 years of life! Then I managed to obtain a legendary class!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I want to hit Lady Luck...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Just as I was cursing at Lady Luck,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid! Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I heard a woman’s voice from upstairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This voice?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was familiar? Where had I heard it recently?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Ah!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Erina.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her voice was as pretty as her face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This damn unfair world! Why was one person born with so many advantages?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, now wasn’t the time to lament at the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Why is that kid here? No, it doesn’t even need questioning.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A very surprising person had come but she was my only hope. I had to accept her help.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I started shouting.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ooof! Ooooof! Oof! Oof!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Here! I am here!&nbsp;</span><span style="">No matter how I shouted, it was hard to make a loud noise with the gag.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Erina was still looking for me upstairs.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Grid! Where are you? Where is this man?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ooooof!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A hoarse cry emerged from my mouth. But Erina couldn’t find me easily.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At the top of the screen, the quest display window was pointed at two hours.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the next two hours, I had to escape and rescue Huroi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What could I do? Dammit, I don’t know! I had to do something!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ooof! Oof!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ah, finally...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Erina, who came downstairs, barely heard my voice and ran.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Ahh! That unlucky girl seemed like an angel at this moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">My appreciation towards Erina rose significantly as she confirmed the situation through the bars and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’ll save you. Not just that. I’ll give you this dagger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oof! Ooof!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Erina held a sheath made of a minotaur horn.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the dagger I made when I competed with her.</span></p>
