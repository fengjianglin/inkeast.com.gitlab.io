 <p><span style="">Chapter 140</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Winston’s parade ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were exactly 100 soldiers gathered in a large space that could accommodate 5,000 people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were bewildered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Morning training has ended, so why are we here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I agree... It is also just our 100 man unit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Currently, Winston had 2,030 troops. Many troops had been lost due to the repeated battles with the Yatan Church, but Earl Steim had brought new soldiers to fill up those numbers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Only 100 of them were called out of 2,000 troops, so they couldn’t help feeling anxious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were the 13th Hundred Man Unit, famous for causing a lot of mishaps!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, they waiting anxiously as they thought about the punishment they would receive.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"First of all, let’s try to think about what we did wrong. Last night, the armory guards... The third group? Did you doze off while keeping watch?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That doesn’t make sense. The situation is still tense because of the Yatan Church, so how can we sleep on duty? We slept secretly in turns. Our network was very thorough. We weren’t caught.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Really? Then the second group? You patrolled the market. Did the merchants complain that you stole things?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It can’t be. We only ate fruit or meat skewers, and no one made a fuss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Umm... I don’t think we did anything wrong recently. We made some gangsters who worsened security disabled, but we can’t be punished for that. Right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That act deserves a reward... Then what? What did we do wrong that we were made to gather?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the end, the soldiers couldn’t solve it on their own and asked their captain, Jude.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Captain, why have we been called?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...I don’t know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jude was also unable to understand the situation. He was moving about the usual schedule when there was suddenly an order to assemble.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jude wasn’t smart enough to guess why, so he just stood silently.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Anyway, our captain won’t know anything about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I agree. Fighting is our captain’s strongest point. He is useless in everything else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soldiers were in the midst of talking when two knights appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were Romeo, an outstanding knight and his second in command, Deck.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Romeo, who wore glittering golden full plate armor and a red cloak, shouted in a loud voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Be quiet and pay attention! Viscount Grid is coming!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Viscount Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He married the lady just yesterday. Did he become a noble today?&nbsp;</span><span style="">A noble should consume their stamina on the first night and enjoy the honeymoon, so why was he coming to the parade ground?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid appeared while the soldiers were feeling puzzled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was wearing white armor and gloves and a great sense of dignity was coming from him. He made Romeo’s brilliant gold armor seem shallow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'The rumored hero who saved Winston from the previous lord and the Mero Company...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the first time the 13th Hundred Man Unit saw Grid. They all felt admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There is a story that he rescued Lady Irene after killing Malacus.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Isn’t he also a great blacksmith? He is amazing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had a high amount of reputation, and was also rich in the dignity stat. The soldiers were envious and overwhelmed him with their gazes, causing Grid’s head to lower in embarrassment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid climbed onto the podium and fixed his attention on Jude before smiling faintly and saying,.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The quality is generally good. Irene recommended this hundred man unit for a reason.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The average level of the current Winston soldiers were around 70~80. The soldiers that Grid saw yesterday had an average combat power of around 1,000.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the soldiers of the 13th Hundred Man Unit had an average combat power of 2,000 while Jude had a huge 5,000 combat power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Given the fact that the level 180 knights armed with top-tier items had a combat power around 7,500, Jude’s combat power was unusually high for someone only wearing poor quality chain mail.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid felt a strong interest and touched the sheath at his waist. Then he pulled out the sword received from Irene.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Commander’s Sword]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 100/100 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 100</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Dignity +30</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Skill 'Character Observation’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A sword given to military commanders appointed by royalty or nobles.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It isn’t suitable for use as a weapon because of all the jewels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But it gives the military command the advantage of being able to observe the soldiers’ abilities closely. It is useful when commanding an army.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 220</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Character Observation.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your insight is more than 600 points. Due to the influence of insight, Character Observation Lv.3 is activated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Character Insight Lv.3]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You can grasp not just the personal information of the target being observed, but their current stats, the limit of their stats and their skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Targets to be observed are limited to allies.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Name: Jude</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Age: 25 &nbsp;&nbsp;Gender: Male</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Occupation: Captain of Winston’s 13th Hundred Man Unit</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level: 103</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Strength: 818/2,080 &nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 431/908&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Agility: 34/330 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligence: 11/20</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skills: Snatch the Enemy’s Weapon and Use it as a Weapon (S). Silence (A). I have no Idea (SS-).</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A rare fool born in Winston. When it comes to strength, he doesn’t fall behind anyone. He is a natural warrior who doesn’t know fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Unfortunately, his brain is less evolved. No matter how hard he tries, he can never climb to a higher position. It is close to a miracle that he became the captain of a hundred man unit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Then what about the knights?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid followed by observing Romeo and Deck.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Name: Romeo Laniche</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Age: 34 &nbsp;&nbsp;Gender: Male</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Occupation: Lady Irene’s knight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level: 196</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Strength: 878/910 &nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 420/441&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Agility: 253/270 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligence: 174/200</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill: Elite Spirit (A+). Decent Blow (A+) Cool-headed (B).</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The son of Viscount Laniche and Phoenix’s disciple. He followed Captain Phoenix and naturally served the Steim family.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His talent grew from the beginning and trained in an elite course. However, he is in distress because his growth has been stagnant lately.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Name: Deck</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Age: 32 &nbsp;&nbsp;Gender: Male</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Occupation: Lady Irene’s knight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level: 185</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Strength: 750/1,050 &nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 334/536&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Agility: 213/320 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligence: 199/230</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill: Flattery (B+). Ability to Grasp the Situation (S-). Conventional Swordsmanship (B).</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His ability to read the situation is excellent. He always acts according to the trends. He has talent as a commander.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Looking at the total stats, the knights were much higher than Jude.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘But considering the level difference, Jude actually has higher stats compared to the knights.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The innate stats that Jude were born with were higher than the innate stats of the knights.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a reasonable thought.&nbsp;</span><span style="">By nature, weren’t humans born with different talents?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jude was born with talent higher than Romeo and Deck.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘But more than the innate stats... It is the maximum growth of the stats.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The numbers that Jude’s stats could grow to completely overwhelmed Romeo and Deck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If Jude was able to grow to his full potential, he would be at least twice as strong as Romeo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The disadvantage is his unreasonably low intelligence, but Jude has many advantages to overcome that shortcoming.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid noted the ratings of Jude’s skills. The ratings of Jude’s skills were much higher than the knights, and these skills seemed to be one of the sources of Jude’s high combat strength.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid made his decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Jude, I will raise you as my knight.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As a viscount, Grid had the authority to appoint three knights.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A normal person would’ve wanted a smart knight or a governor of a city, but Grid thought differently.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can’t be stupid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He would pick those whose stats could grow to become his knight and make them as loyal as dogs.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid smiled wickedly and started to check the character information of the other soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, none of the remaining 100 soldiers had talent worthy of Jude. But they definitely were more skilled than ordinary soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If Grid made them work in this raid... No, if he trained them well, they would be reborn as elite soldiers who would help protect Winston and Irene.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is it good to have a husband like him?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is he doing?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After Grid’s appearance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t say anything and pulled out a sword, looking over the soldiers with a grin. Grid’s appearance didn’t look normal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The person who was lauded as a hero was behaving strangely, causing the knights and soldiers to feel anxious.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is a little...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It seems like they are just rumors.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They started to feel disappointed with Grid!&nbsp;</span><span style="">After verifying all of the soldiers’ information, Grid finally returned the Commander’s Sword to its sheath before cutting straight to the point.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We will depart for Bairan Village.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Bairan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why are we going there all of a sudden...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soldiers started to murmur. Romeo frowned at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hey! Concentrate!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah, what a surprise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was startled because he was standing right next to Romeo. He smiled at the soldiers then started explaining,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"We are going to Bairan Village to defeat the Guardian of the Forest. It will be a tough journey, so everyone should be prepared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Heok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The exclamation of shock wasn’t from the soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was from Romeo, who looked at Grid with hesitation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a knight from a noble family, he was normally highly conscious of his image. However, he forgot about it as he trembled in front of the soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"V-Viscount? You want to defeat the Guardian of the Forest? With just these people? Are you serious?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hat...! No, why are you saying something so absurd?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Guardian of the Forest was a peak golem type monster, and was impossible to damage with merely swords and arrows since its body was covered with hard rocks and orichalcum.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It also constantly summoned small golems and the attack power was threatening enough to cause earthquakes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was one of the strongest monsters in the north.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It will be difficult to defeat the Guardian of the Forest, even if you bring along all of Winston’s troops!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Romeo asserted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This wasn’t an exaggeration.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Guardian of the Forest required dozens of magicians or two or more great magicians to defeat. But the magicians in Winston were at a mediocre level and there were only four of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was impossible to knock down the Guardian of the Forest with 2,000 troops if they didn’t have a powerful magic unit. The 2,000 troops would be wiped out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yet Grid wanted to defeat the Guardian of the Forest with 100 soldiers and two knights?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Romeo then recalled the Tzedakah Guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah! Perhaps you are planning to call the Tzedakah Guild? Are you planning to join forces with them, just like when you defeated Malacus?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What nonsense are you saying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Obviously, it would be easy to defeat the Guardian of the Forest if he called the Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid had no intention of doing the raid with the Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The soldiers and knights were NPC salary workers, so they couldn’t look at the items dropped by the Guardian of the Forest, while the Tzedakah Guild members were equal to Grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If he did the raid with them, Grid would have to split the items with them. He didn’t want that.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In other words, Grid planned a raid with NPCs in an attempt to monopolize all the drops from the Guardian of the Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘In the first place, there is no need to ask for their help.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had defeated the pope alone. Why should he borrow the guild’s hands when he could easily get rid of the Guardian of the Forest?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He shouted,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Everybody move! We will depart straight away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Isn’t this like a lightning bolt out of the blue...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The knights and soldiers were grouchy. They thought they would die. Grid was making the wrong moves as soon as he became the lady’s husband. They were worried about their future.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Jude had no thoughts. He just silently followed Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the day when Grid’s subordinate fostering program began.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the same time, Khan’s smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...When is Grid coming to work?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner had arrived at the smithy since early morning and had been waiting for Grid for five hours.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had been too agitated about being deprived of Irene and lost his temper. Therefore, he wanted to apologize to Grid for being rude and ask him to make the armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the moment he had been waiting 40 days for.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He hoped that Grid would come to the smithy as soon as possible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid never showed up at the smithy, even when lunchtime passed and it became night.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He is enjoying his honeymoon and not even showing up to his job... That bastard... He isn’t even responding to the guild chat or whispers...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner’s expression turned dark.</span></p>
