 <p><span style="">Chapter 251</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style=""> "I am a farmer of Reidan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Bullshit!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t convincing that the monster who killed Zibal was a farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What idiot would believe him?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The members of the three guilds thought Piaro was mocking them. But their emotions were more fearful than angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the case of the Snake Guild, they wanted revenge for their murdered master, but were unable to move.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because their legs were shaking after seeing the hand plow covered in their master’s blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Stronger than a boss monster! I will die if I get hit by that hand plow!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The penalty that occurred due to death was fatal. Experience dropped and there was a chance of losing items. They had to deal with such a monster?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The executives cried out to the guild members who were overwhelmed by Piaro’s strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What are you doing? The opponent is your master’s enemy! Get revenge, even if you have to sacrifice your lives!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If they stepped back with fear, they would lose their prestigious status. They would become a laughing stock and eventually dissolve.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The guild members recognized this fact. They no longer hesitated and besieged Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Fuck. Yes! I’d rather die! It’s better than the guild being ruined!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will kill him, even if I have to die!'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The benefits that the guild gave them were astronomical. The guild couldn’t be lost.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The determination of the Snake Guild members was passed onto Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘How many battlefields have I been on?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the days of the Red Knights, Piaro’s life was war and the battlefield was his home.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He felt joy as he recalled the days when he was surrounded by hundreds of enemies and his colleagues. His blood was boiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is exciting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was different from a spar. There was no need to suppress his strength.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a chance to unleash the Supreme Swordsmanship that had grown by working in the fields for several months and training with strong people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He went on a rampage.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Keok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A Snake Guild member was pierced in the heart with a hoe. Piaro was proficient in the hoe after using it for several months. He narrowed the gap and killed the opponent before they realized.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After their master, their colleagues were killed(and by farming equipment), so the Snake Guild members were outraged. Their anger now outstripped their fear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was what Piaro wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He withdrew his hoe and used Supreme Swordsmanship, 5th style.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The waves of light formed a square and swirled around the enemies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a wide-range skill that couldn’t be defended or avoided.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Blood flew from all sides, like a spider web. It was an unbelievable sight because there wasn’t a single drop of blood from Piaro in the center.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s gaze headed towards Asuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Asuka.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the past, she was the berserker who drove Grid to the defensive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro could see her strength with one glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"How dare you aim for the Young Lady!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Black Teddy summoned five bears to block the rushing Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were white bears wearing sunglasses. Their red cloaks flapped nicely as they unfolded their martial arts and intercepted Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuwaaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">They were very fast and strong. It was also difficult to find a gap in their solid formation. They could even fight against a 3rd advancement class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, they met the wrong opponent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Cola Bear 1 has disappeared.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Cola Bear 3 has disappeared.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After blocking the attack with the hoe, he counterattacked with the hand plow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro repeated this process and the bears fell helplessly before him. They weren’t bears, but puppies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Black Teddy was able to realize it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘H-He is on a different dimension.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The executives of the Snake Guild were going crazy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Where did Grid pick up this monster?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A named NPC.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t easy to meet them, and impossible to capture them. They had a huge influence on Satisfy’s world, so it was virtually impossible for a user to obtain one.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid had one as a subordinate. He even seemed to be a farmer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The executives couldn’t even be jealous. It was amazing. No, it was a surprise that was beyond awe. Grid was incredible.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk!</span></i> <i><span style="">Puk!</span></i> <i><span style="">Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro completely destroyed Black Teddy’s bears and immediately hit him with the hand plow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 7,350 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 7,350 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 7,350 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heeok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was fixed damage that ignored defense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the manifestation of qi.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Black Teddy died.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The first ranked user in the pet rankings died because of a hand plow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he wasn’t ashamed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hadn’t this hand plow killed the second ranked user?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was fortunate that the rumor ‘Black Teddy died from a hand plow!’ was suppressed by ‘Zibal died by a hand plow!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have died.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Black Teddy couldn’t read the orbit of the hand plows and eventually died.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Everyone watching was at a loss for words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal was killed first by a hand plow, but people thought it was due to the ‘instantaneous death’ skill being activated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But they could see that the instantaneous death skill wasn’t the problem. Piaro’s basic attack power was too strong. It was like an upgraded version of Hurent’s Aura Master. Who could endure it?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Among the people standing like a stone statue, Asuka burned with determination.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was a berserker.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was strong in a crisis.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Due to the correction effect of the ‘Berserk’ passive skill, fear began to change into pleasure. Her aggressive tendencies were maximized.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will get revenge for what Grid did to me in the past by killing Grid’s subordinate!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Asuka proclaimed and grabbed her legendary item ‘Ainas’ Sickle.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro encouraged her,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Please have strength.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He wasn’t Duke Grid’s subordinate. Well, this misunderstanding didn’t matter.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chwaruruk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Asuka threw the sickle as hard as she could. As the chains unfolded, the tip of the sickle dropped like lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hoh, good skills.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro admired and defended against the sickle with his hoe.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He was caught!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Asuka smiled with satisfaction. She grabbed the chain and pulled the hoe towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is great technique and strength.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro praised. After pulling him close, Asuka swapped to Euprates’ Greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Indeed, the power was brilliant. As a tycoon’s daughter, she owned several legendary items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euprates’ Greatsword distorted the atmosphere.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the moment when the ultimate skill of the 3rd advancement berserker, Madness’ Wrath was unfolded through the greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro’s excited expression cooled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Your greatsword techniques are lacking. Especially when compared to Duke Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Asuka was the guild’s number two and ranked 31st overall. It meant she was as strong as the Overgeared members. But no matter what she did, she wasn’t a match for Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Supreme Swordsmanship’s 4th style completely neutralized Madness’ Wrath, then he linked it with the 1st style.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Cracks appeared in the greatsword and the hand plow struck Asuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered fatal damage!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kyak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A berserker’s defense was weak. She invested all her points in strength and agility, and neglected stamina.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But even so, for a skill to decrease her health by two-thirds?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Asuka was unable to deal with the destructive power and collapsed. But she quickly stood up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A berserker’s physical ability rose in proportion to their lost health. She became stronger the more injured she became.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The real fight is from now on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Asuka swapped out the broken greatsword to ‘Heroic Death Spear.’ Then she moved the spear in a dazzling manner.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro was disappointed again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Your spearsmanship is unremarkable compared to Viscount Pon.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">His hoe blocked the coarse spear. It was followed by his hand plow. It was a technique that combined dual wielding the hand plow and hoe with his judgment. Asuka couldn’t believe it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Asuka cried out as she was hit in the forehead.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was hit twice by the hand plow and her health was now at the bottom. It was truly absurd.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She gritted her teeth. Then she lifted the sickle again and pushed on with her increased physical abilities.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But her lacking control skills couldn’t deal any harm to Piaro. She attempted to take his bones and flesh as a last resort, but Piaro wasn’t easily hit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The hoe and hand plow barrier only gave Asuka despair.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, she also died.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the moment that embarrassing rumors about ‘dying from a hand plow!’ spread.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Snake Guild’s chief of staff, Box, quickly grasped the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘We can’t beat him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro was an absolute existence.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The perfect combat ability combined with high stats was a wall that couldn’t be crossed with the users’ current level.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Box bet that even if the 1st ranked Kraugel was in this place, he wouldn’t be able to hurt Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The user’s level must be at least 360 in order to compete with him. Then...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He gave up on killing Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Box made a decision and shouted to Seuron and Hao,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“We will tie up his feet! You must smash Reidan during that gap!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yes, they couldn’t go back with only losses.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their initial purpose was to devastate Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had to slow down Grid’s expansion. For that, Box would sacrifice anything.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Box’s decision made Seuron and Hao laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Good judgment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">To be honest, Seuron and Hao were reluctant to deal with the NPC called Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They wanted to retreat, but they no longer needed to thanks to the Snake Guild’s decision.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Snake Guild would tie up Piaro’s feet while they headed towards Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">So what if three farmers were blocking their way?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Were named NPCs so common?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The other three farmers were clearly weaker than Piaro. Maybe they were just ordinary farmers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Soul Predator Sueron led the way.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had already recovered the souls of the Snake Guild members who died, and summoned and fired three soul spears.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Get lost.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The unique skill, Soul Spears, had the ability to deal a deadly blow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was difficult for even top rankers to deal with the attack power, so the three farmers would be killed instantly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">One farmer biting a potato summoned magic and destroyed a soul spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The eyes of Seuron and the 211 Golden Guild members widened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, that wasn’t the end.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Another farmer took out a shield and gently blocked two soul spears.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"W-What are these guys?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The named NPC called Piaro wasn’t the only one!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Seuron had to find a hole.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He targeted the only farmer among the three who hadn’t moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That fellow!" He must be an ordinary farmer! Break through him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Golden Guild vigorously replied.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The farmer, Kraugel, faced them and laughed.</span></p>
