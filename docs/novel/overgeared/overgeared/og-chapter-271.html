 <p><span style="">Chapter 271</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Combat. In particular, replaying battles where one was defeated was a big help to their growth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kamiyan closed his eyes and replayed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘When Grid decided to stab me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What if he didn’t defend, but decided to push forward instead?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I would still be hit. If Grid hit me from the side, the result would be the same.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What if he backed off?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I would still be hit. At that time, Grid was already narrowing the distance between us with the maximum stride.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No matter how he looked, defense was the best choice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the problem was that Kamiyan’s swordsmanship couldn’t defend against it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It took an instant for the straight orbit to change into a circle.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The spear flying in a straight line changed to a circular orbit just before it his his sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Honestly, it gave Kamiyan goose bumps.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was able to feel that Grid was an expert with the spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I have to respond with a skill.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If he used Super Armor, he could defend against the attack. Then he would be able to counterattack while Grid was being pushed back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Then I would’ve been the winner.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was hesitant to use his trump card in the first battle. He didn’t use the skill, so the result was a defeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dammit... I didn’t think it would hurt so much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He wore the Red Armor, but he couldn’t even survive one shot.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The attack power of Lifael’s Spear was beyond imagination. It was truly a divine artifact.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It was a wrong fight from the beginning.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kamiyan hadn’t expected that Grid could use Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, he wasn’t vigilant and didn’t respond when Grid retrieved Lifael’s Spear. From there, the flow passed onto Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was unfair.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Isn’t he a swordsman?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Several members of the church had witnessed Grid fighting against Drevigo. There were also elders among them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The elders had explained what happened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was said to use a greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then how could he use a spear?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘In addition, it’s Lifael’s Spear!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Wasn’t Lifael’s Spear a weapon that could only be used by a few ‘women’ who received the goddess’ divine message?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s really annoying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The biggest cause of his defeat was ‘wrong information.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">This error-prone information planted useless preconceptions and caused him to lose.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I should’ve assumed that Grid could use Lifael’s Spear.’ </span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then he wouldn’t have been hit so hard!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaduduk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Kamiyan gritted his teeth. It was enough to drive him crazy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was boiling with anger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The anger was unleashed through his sword, as he trained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid! Next time will be different! I will be alert! I will show you the true power of the Red Knights!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was evaluated by the enemies that the current Red Knights were weaker than they were in the past.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was inevitable.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The former Red Knights had the great swordsman Piaro, so the current Red Knights without Piaro were judged to be one level lower.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Duke Limit had never once won against Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But that was a story of the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Lord Limit is now over Piaro.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was clear that the Red Knights who studied under Duke Limit had also surpassed him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In order to prove it, the Red Knights had to be undefeated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kamiyan was determined to beat Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You will see soon!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Kamiyan’s sword was covered in aura and smashed the large rock.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He became even stronger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The legendary blacksmith and the best swordsman after Sword Saint Muller.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was known to be able to handle all types of weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The same was true for Grid, who inherited his power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But to even be able to use the three divine artifacts of the church...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is very frustrating.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal needed to quickly determine Isabel’s successor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pascal planned to raise his position by appointing a girl he secretly fostered as the new Rebecca’s Daughter.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the problem was that Grid would definitely not hand over Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Damian, that bastard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This must be Damian’s trick.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He asked Grid to protect Lifael’s Spear in order to contain Pascal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I won’t be hit by such a trick.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pascal went to meet the elders. He made them write an order for Grid to return Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Grid, even you can’t violate the official order of our church.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If the command was broken?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Then it can’t be helped. You will be considered an enemy... Huh?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal held the order while heading towards the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Pascal?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Damian!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal stumbled across Damian, who was campaigning.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian was raising the atmosphere with the help of that fellow called Huroi, who was like a charlatan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pascal was upset when he saw Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You! Lifael’s Spear is a divine artifact of our church! How could you give it to Grid illegally? You have to clear this up or you will be punished!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian didn’t understand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“What are you saying? The current owner of Lifael’s Spear is Isabel-chan. She is the one who left it directly to Grid...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Shut up!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Isabel is already dead! So the ownership of Lifael’s Spear returned to the elders... Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal suddenly closed his mouth. He looked like he had seen a ghost.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His complexion was worse than when he wondered if Grid was a woman.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because he saw a woman with brightly shining platinum hair approaching.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What’s the fuss?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">The woman questioned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Isabel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Isabel wasn’t dead?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rather than dying, her color was completely recovered and she was walking fine on her own?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian asked the stunned Pascal,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Isabel-chan is dead? Have you finally become senile?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Unbelievable!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How did she suddenly recover her health after dying?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Things are going terribly wrong!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Some unknown actions were occurring in a place that he couldn’t see.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was a serious problem.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pascal held his head as he tried to understand the situation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he saw something dropping.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was hair.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The stress that occurred since Grid appeared led to hair loss.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Hwaduk.</span></i> <i><span style="">Hwaduuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A bunch of hair fell every time he touched his head, causing Pascal’s anger to escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Gridddd!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This person.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Things started to become twisted the moment he appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pascal could no longer tolerate Grid’s presence.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He nervously tore up the order he just had written.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid! You are now my enemy!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was thoroughly decided.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian and Isabel felt a sense of catharsis after seeing Pascal’s state and clapped.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">[Light Wheel]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Stabbing, hacking, cutting, etc.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Any type of attack will be linked to a circular attack. The target won’t be able to escape this irregular attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The hit rate is 100%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Contains the light attribute.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This skill gave Lifael’s Spear a 100% hit rate.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was no resource consumption or cooldown time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This skill had a ‘high’ chance of activating during a general attack, and the power was really fraudulent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I thought it wasn’t good because there was no additional damage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a miscalculation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to the extraordinary high base damage of Lifael’s Spear, the option of a 100% hit rate was huge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was enough to knock down a famous Red Knight with one hit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an unexpected result even for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Lifael’s Spear. This is the majesty of a myth rated weapon.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But there was one regrettable thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A spear doesn’t fit with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pagma’s Swordsmanship Lv. 3&nbsp;</span><span style="">When deactivated, it increased Grid’s attack power by 32%, the chance of a critical attack by 22% and the damage of a critical attack by 15%.&nbsp;</span><span style="">When activated, it allowed him to use active skills such as Kill, Link and Transcend.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, this was on the condition that it was a sword type weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The skill wasn’t activated when weapons other than a sword type were equipped.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a sad fact for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have to give up on using Lifael’s Spear for myself.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, he scheduled it to be included in Grid’s set.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was for Pon, the guild members, and the soldiers who used the spear as their main weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid planned for a day when the guild members and soldiers would wear Grid’s set.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kukukuk! Puhahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Overgeared Kingdom!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid felt a thrill at the people who would praise the cool name, while the soldiers of his fantastic kingdom would wear the Grid set.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That person... Isn’t he scary?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Right? I think so as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“He doesn’t seem like a normal person...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The smithy inside the Vatican.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The blacksmiths muttered as they felt an negative energy coming from Grid. Their eyes weren’t good as they looked at Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid didn’t care about the gaze of others.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No. To be precise, there was no need to worry about it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His mind was solely focused on Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Lifael’s Spear was completely disassembled over two days.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid tried to figure out the hidden structure of the spear through the process of reassembly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He spent a few days studying the spear in the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The process of observation, disassembly and assembly were tirelessly repeated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to his natural talents of ‘persistence’ and ‘concentration,’ Grid was able to immerse himself in the tedious process without ending it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The result...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your understanding of Lifael’s Spear &nbsp;is now at 100%!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Blueprint: Lifael’s Spear has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Experiencing every detail of a myth rated weapon will raise your skills to the next level!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The level of all skills related to production will increase by one.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[(Witness of God’s Weapon) Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill has evolved into (Understanding of Gods’ Weapons) Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Good!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Including the time he spent with Isabel in her room, he achieved this in 11 days.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The hidden abilities didn’t appear as he expected, but he grasped how to use the Goddess' Essence and various skills were strengthened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, that wasn’t all.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had acquired the design of a myth rated item.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was just as happy as when he obtained Piaro and Asmophel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“First of all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Right now, he had no material to make Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid made a meaningful smile and grasped the hammer again.</span></p>
