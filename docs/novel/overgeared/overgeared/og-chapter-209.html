 <p><span style="">A descendant of a prestigious bloodline in the Saharan Empire, he was born with a natural talent for swordsmanship and military tactics. He joined the knights at a young age and became a captain in only 12 years.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the following 5 years, he succeeded in winning a lot of achievements. However, 2 years ago, he witnessed the liaison between Asmophel and Empress Marie.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was wrongfully branded as an imperial traitor and forced to flee.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Currently, this person is suffering from a severe sickness of the heart. He has lost his original nature and all stats are reduced by 20% from those shown in the status window.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Trap Installation]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro can install simple traps. It’s a skill acquired to beat his pursuers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Empire's Swordsmanship]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The basic swordsmanship passed down to the knights of the Saharan Empire. It is made of five forms and is easy to learn, but the power is relatively good.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro has reconstructed this swordsmanship and raised it to a higher level.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Overwhelming]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro can overwhelm a target that has a much lower level than you. The overwhelmed target will feel fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Empire's Military Tactics]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">High level military tactics that the Saharan commanders learn. Piaro personally studied these tactics and raised it to another level.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He can seamlessly command thousands of troops.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Great Swordsman’s Enlightenment]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pairo developed aura after achieving enlightenment as a swordsman. Be cautious, since the forming the aura will take some time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now that he has become one with the sword, his aura has become intangible and more powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His sword techniques have gone beyond the limits of a human.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Supreme Swordsmanship]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The swordsmanship that was passed through Piaro’s family for generations. Piaro was able to become a great swordsman by mastering this swordsmanship that hasn’t been mastered by anyone in his family for hundreds of years.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There is a theory that this swordsmanship originated on the Eastern Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Fated to Perish]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s unique technique. The sword will attack one point on the target. The target hit by the sword must die.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro is deserving to be a legend just from this technique alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Mana Consumption: 40% of the maximum mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 1 hour.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* This skill can’t be applied in quests and raids. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style=""></span></p>
 <p>'It is beyond my expectations.’</p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s passive skill was comparable to Pagma’s Swordsmanship (Lv. 2), which increased physical attack by 30%, critical hit rate by 20%, and critical damage by 10%.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Moreover, his active skills were brilliant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘In particular, the Fated to Perish skill is terrifying. A skill that will 100% kill a person?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a technique that made him eligible to become a legend.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was safe to call this a legendary rated skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid admired something else about Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There is no limit on his stats increase.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">So far, all NPCs that Grid observed had a limit on their stats. It was the same with higher rated NPCs like Jude and Minor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro’s name might be marked with gold, but there were no limits on his stats, so he could grow infinitely like a user.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Yes, this is truly a named-grade NPC.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was thrilled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“You, won’t you become my knight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"There are several things to point out. First of all, who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid introduced himself in a confident manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m Grid, Pagma’s Descendant and a duke of the Eternal Kingdom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Saharan Empire was the peak nation on the continent, so they dismissed the Eternal Kingdom. In fact, the Eternal Kingdom offered a tribute to the empire, just like other kingdoms.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro was a noble of the Saharan Empire, so the duke of a small kingdom didn’t seem great at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Just, “Pagma's Descendant?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro couldn’t stand still.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Blacksmith Pagma, he had earned the reputation as the best swordsman since Sword Saint Muller.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was natural that Piaro was interested in a legend’s descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is this the truth?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro quickly showed a combat posture. It was his instincts as a swordsman.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid smiled awkwardly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Why do you suddenly look like that? Do you want to fight? I don’t want to do that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro pointed his sword at Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“You are the one who rambled first. Suddenly asking me to become your knight? I should first check to see if you are qualified.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro could accurately guess the level of Pagma's Descendant. Then he could gauge his gap with Sword Saint Muller.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro decided and rushed towards Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid thought it was ridiculous as the distance between them was narrowed in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is he seriously brandishing a sword at me? Is he crazy about fighting?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had wanted to avoid the fight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His weak self in the past would’ve run away, but now he was strong.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He pulled out the +9 Failure.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro admired the blue shark-shaped greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That’s a great sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid identified Piaro’s sword and scoffed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Your sword is unimpressive. Well, if it’s repaired, then it will improve.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Weapons aren’t important.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kkirik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro rotated the sword in his hand that had collided with Failure. Then Grid felt a tremendous pressure and almost let go of Failure. He had to tighten his grip in order to not lose it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have more strength, but why am I being pushed in a power struggle? Is this technique?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At this time, all of Grid’s strength was concentrated on his upper body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro kicked Grid’s ankle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid stumbled. Piaro’s foot aimed at his face while he was leaning sideways.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid raised his knee to defend against the kick.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This time, his strength was concentrated on his lower body.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chukak.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro rotated his sword again and struck Failure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Blood spurted from Grid’s chest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro expressed his thoughts.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Poor techniques. Your claim about being Pagma's Descendant is false. Or was Pagma’s skill this low in the first place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Poor techniques? It doesn’t matter if you disrespect Pagma, but don’t humiliate me!” </span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid became serious.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His pride was dented so he triggered Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Link.&nbsp;</span><span style="">21 blue-white blades were generated and covered Piaro at a fearsome speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaeeeeeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro defended against all 21 strikes by moving his sword with minimal movements.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His stats might’ve fallen by 20%, but this was possible because his agility was twice as high as Grid’s.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the meantime, Grid had only been investing his points in strength and stamina. But now he gained enlightenment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Speed is really important in swordsmanship. I need to invest in agility in the future.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is this your best technique?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro was disappointed and looked at Grid with derision.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No way!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid used a combo skill that he developed over his many combat experiences.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Theoretically, it was a combo guaranteed to win.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Restraint!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid first restrained Piaro’s actions. Rather than linking with Kill which might kill Piaro, he struck three times. Then once Restraint was almost over, he used Wave to slow down Piaro’s movements and used Link again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s high agility and passive skill meant he defended against most of the attacks, but he eventually allowed two attacks and coughed out blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then he dropped his sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? Is this the end?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was immersed in the duel, so he couldn’t help asking Piaro with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Doesn’t it seem like you’re holding back? I admit defeat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In fact, Piaro also hadn’t used all his strength. He didn’t use Fated to Perish.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But even if he used it, Grid had his invincible passive skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid didn’t doubt his victory, so his expression brightened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay. Now that I’ve won, will you become my knight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro shook his head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I just said I would see if you are qualified. I never promised to become your knight. I’m sorry, but I promised to never swear allegiance to anyone again. I can’t accept your request.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Are you traumatized because of your experience of being abandoned by your master?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid spoke honestly to the baffled Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I'm well aware of your situation. Weren’t you framed by a colleague and became a fugitive? The fact that the emperor didn’t help you meant that he also doubted your loyalty... Now you’re determined to completely isolate yourself from the world after being betrayed by your colleagues?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro showed killing intent for the first time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The empire is the only one who should know that story. It isn’t something that can be discovered through rumors. Did Asmophel tell you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No? I heard this story directly from you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was this nonsense?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro still looked puzzled, so Grid pointed to his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Look closely. Aren’t I somehow familiar?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Come to think of it...?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro finally remembered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Are you the person from that time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A year and a half ago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was one person who entered Kesan Canyon, a place where powerful monsters were found, by himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At the time, he was weak, but he seemed like he would grow quickly. So Piaro asked him to act on Piaro’s behalf.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Amazing. Your skills, atmosphere and appearance have changed. I didn’t think you would be the ugly person from that time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No matter how ugly I was, saying that...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was shocked and frustrated by Piaro’s blunt words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After a short silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid barely managed to regain his mind and proposed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will get revenge for you. Instead, come with me. Isn’t it too unfair for you to live away from the world just because of a traitor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro questioned him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I don’t know why you need me. Isn’t the Eternal Kingdom guaranteed peace as a neutral kingdom? Why do you need my help?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I want you to escort me when I go to find minerals...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What nonsense...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In fact, Grid’s intentions didn’t matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'If I can achieve my revenge...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro lost everything due to Asmophel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His colleagues loyal to him were killed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Revenge was Piaro’s last desire.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If I can achieve my revenge, I’m even willing to sell my soul to the devil.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But the problem was after his revenge was achieved.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was he willing to pledge the rest of his life to someone?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As Piaro hesitated, Grid stabbed right to his core.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You wanted a duel as soon as you heard that I am Pagma’s Descendant, so aren’t you still longing for strength? Don’t you want to become a sword saint? Among my companions, there are many strong people. Don’t you want to live and train with them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"... But I doubt that I can be loyal to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You don’t have to force yourself to be loyal. You don’t have to pledge to be a knight if you’re unwilling. Stay as my guest. You can decide for yourself if you want to follow me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t want to miss Piaro, so he eventually took a step back. Therefore, Piaro had no choice but to accept Grid’s proposal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On that day, Grid left the city where he lived for a year and eight months after he became Pagma’s Descendant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the moment when the legend shifted to a new stage.</span></p>
