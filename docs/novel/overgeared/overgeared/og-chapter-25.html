 <p><span style="">Chapter 25</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>"Go to hell! Johnson's enemy!”</p>
 <p><i><span style="">Buuuong.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The explosive sound of the surrounding enemies attacking me was enough to cause pain and sweat to flow down.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kwajajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">These were attacks with the power to break a wall with one blow!&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was able to avoid the attacks a few times due to the slow speed and simple trajectory, but I wondered how long I could maintain this concentration.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the enemies started to use their heads.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Attack at the same time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ohhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Different weapons simultaneously struck out from every direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have received 150 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have received 163 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Urghh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My health gauge reached the bottom with just two hits and had only 23 health left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Crazy. They weren’t even critical hits.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I pulled out a potion from my inventory and drank it. It was an intermediate health potion that restored 1,500 health at once.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘My health is considerably less than 1,500, but an intermediate potion is the lowest grade potion I have. It would’ve been nice if I had an inferior potion...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The potion reuse time was 20 seconds, so I had to defend myself from attacks for at least 20 seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now the enemies had started systematically linking their strikes. It became harder.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We have been fighting together for 10 years. No matter what you try, you will eventually go to hell!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I moved to the side in order to avoid the big sword that would take off my head, then an attack aimed for my knees, as if they had predicted my movements.&nbsp;</span><span style="">My battle senses, developed from my days as a warrior, let out a warning.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was unavoidable!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I aimed the arrow downwards.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The Special Jaffa Arrow accurately hit the mace in an attempt to shift the orbit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But an arrow was a very lightweight weapon. It was impossible for a light weapon to shift the orbit of the large mace that weighed several kilograms.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The mace hit half of my knee, dealing a critical blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have received 200 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your left leg is severely damaged. Movement speed has decreased by 40%. The ability to control your body has decreased.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As I groaned on the floor, a strike of lightning could be heard above me.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If I stayed still, my skull would be caved in.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hup!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I endured the pain and rolled back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kakakakak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The floor where I had been lying just a few seconds ago was smashed to pieces.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I stared at the enemies and made a decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will act luxuriously today.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I steeled my heart, pulling out the intermediate strength potion and intermediate agility potion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The price for one was 10 gold.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">10 gold was 12,000 won!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I’m sorry but it can’t be helped.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I closed my eyes and poured 20 gold, in other words, 24,000 won, down my throat.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Gulp gulp.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">I shed tears as the buff potion was swallowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Ahh! This potion is more expensive than the sweet and sour pork set!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I prepared the buff potions for moments of crisis during Earl Ashur’s quest, but I felt such regret that I never used them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now they were being used to complete a B-grade quest, not a boss monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have taken the intermediate strength potion. Strength will increase by 50 for five minutes.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have taken the intermediate agility potion. Agility will increase by 50 for five minutes.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a flood of attacks from two directions as the notification windows popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Son of a bitch! Don’t think that we can’t touch you while you are eating!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was able to avoid the two attacks due to my sharp rise in agility, then I gripped the arrow and fought back.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But two attacks came from different directions and I was forced to give up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Pant pant... r-really horrible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I would’ve died if it wasn’t for the intermediate agility potion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It felt like my heart would burst from the extreme tension, and the gangsters were filled with rage once their attacks were over.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This rotten bastard! How long will you run away?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Where is your momentum from your first attack? What a shameful brat! Fight fair.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The four of them were ganging up on my lone self, yet they were complaining about fighting fairly?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hey, you fuckers have no conscience! Let’s do it one against one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Won’t we still win in a one-on-one fight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Then bring it on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Bullshit! Don’t you know that being able to fight in groups is a virtue?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chwaruruk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The flail stretched out like a whip.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Tatatang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Tang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">I hit it with the arrow and barely managed to spin my body. I felt a hot pain as a greatsword scratched my side.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have received 30 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Fortunately, I succeeded in avoiding it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Once the crisis passed, I tried to continue the conversation to buy time for my potion reuse time to end.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hey guys, let’s talk about it honestly. Shouldn’t you know by now that I’m not a pushover?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The gangsters didn’t want to admit it, but they didn’t refute my words.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I made a suggestion,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Hand over the contract and then no one will die anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The gangsters were furious.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t play games! You think you can get out of here alive after killing Johnson? Don’t worry about the contract. You must die here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What? Is it hard to come forward? Won’t you regret it? You guys really can leave here alive if you hand over the contract.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hahat! Stop talking nonsense! A guy who broke his leg is spouting these words. From the very beginning, we could leave here alive! You are the only one who will die here.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hrmm, will that really happen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">During the conversation, the reuse time for my potions had reset.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I turned away from the gangsters and sneakily drank the potion. At the same time, my health and the wound on my leg recovered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The gangsters thought I was still seriously injured.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I used that to sneak attack one of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“N-No?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They couldn’t respond properly because they thought my leg was still injured.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I pierced one person accurately with the arrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The effect of the Special Jaffa arrow is activated, meaning the enemy’s defense is completely ignored.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Keeok...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have defeated Winston’s outlaw, Neil.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Reputation in Winston Village has increased by 60.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[4,300 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Good!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The gangster stabbed in the belly couldn’t even scream properly as he turned into grey light.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The eyes of the gangsters shook as they lost another companion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You... you bastard! How did your leg suddenly become better? D-Don’t tell me you drank a potion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"... Didn’t you see me drinking it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You stupid bastard! You should fight with your own body!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Bullshit! Can you really say that? You are gangsters trying to bully an innocent citizen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You...! Kill! Kill that brat as soon as possible! He is like a cockroach, so keep attacking until he is dead.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Isn’t he just a druggie? I will crush him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The extremely angry Veil commanded his men.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“The ‘You will Die’ formation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the worst naming sense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In any case, the villains received Veil’s command and unleashed a barrage of attacks.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chukak.</span></i> <i><span style="">Bam!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The murder techniques that didn’t consider defense ran rampant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even if my arrow was aimed at their hearts, they didn’t try to defend or avoid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They kept attacking and attacking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Even if my arrow stabbed them, they didn’t stop attacking. I instantly found myself on the defensive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have received 203 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have received 180 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chwaruruk!</span></i> <i><span style="">Buuuong.</span></i> <i><span style="">Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Like a snake persistently following me on a blocked path, the greatsword with a wide range of attack gave me a big crisis. Even if I avoided the mace, my balance would become off because the mace would break the ground or walls.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were 13 seconds left on my potion reuse time and my health was at the bottom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is my limit. I can’t endure anymore.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Unless the Legendary Blacksmith’s Patience skill activated and my defense and health were strengthened, there was no way to overcome this crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The end...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment I was about to give up on the quest...&nbsp;</span><span style="">I suddenly had a thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why am I depending on potions and skills?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was I a warrior? No. I was Pagma’s Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Where am I right now?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I’m so stupid... Why didn’t I think of this earlier?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I noticed the various weapons and armor displayed all over the room.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A number of things popped into my head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Khan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan, the elder blacksmith standing in the corner, responded instantly to my call.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Speak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I asked him,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Do you want to keep this smithy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Of course! I already gave up, but changed my mind thanks to you. If you help me, I will be able to keep this place!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I liked the cool answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hey, what are you doing now? Why are you chatting with that old man instead of fighting? Are you thinking of some trick?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The gangsters didn’t stop the offensive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I avoided the attack and threw my arrow at the largest of them.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Swaeek!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The quickly thrown Special Jaffa Arrow...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Whether he sensed the crisis or if he was confident, Praga changed his attitude and started defending.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A critical appeared the moment the arrow struck the mace, and its heavy power made Praga instantly back up. However, the other two gangsters didn’t care and struck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I turned around and ran away from them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuhahahaha! Stupid person! You threw away your weapon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The gangsters saw me running away unarmed and chased after me.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Praga overcame the crisis of the flying arrow and sighed with relief.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I never looked back at them. I ran forward with all my strength. Then I ran up the stairs and reached the second floor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a brilliantly shining full plate armor and a super large greatsword that was 3m in length.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I shouted toward Khan on the ground floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Khan, lend me this equipment!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“B-But...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will give them back at the end of the fight! If you want to keep your smithy, give me permission!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Taking away the items without the owner’s consent would label me a criminal. I waited for Khan’s permission, but he paused in a frustrating manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Not just anyone can use that equipment! It is better to lend you the leather armor and blacksmith hammer over here. That is the ideal equipment for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No, just lend this to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"B-but that battle gear...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kihahaha! I’ve finally caught you. Die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Without realizing it, the enemies had neared me.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan finally realized the urgency of the situation and nodded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Y-Yes. If you can use it then feel free to!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Good. You should’ve said it sooner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Due to your class characteristics, you have equipped Dainsleif (Reproduction).]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A penalty is applied because the item conditions aren’t met.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Attack power of Dainsleif (Reproduction) will decrease by 20%. Only half of the option effects will be applied.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The penalties will be reduced if your understanding of Dainsleif (Reproduction) increases.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Due to your class characteristics, you have equipped Valhalla.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A penalty is applied because the item conditions aren’t met.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Defense of Valhalla will decrease by 20%. Only half of the option effects will be applied.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The penalties will be reduced if your understanding of Valhalla increases.]</span></p>
