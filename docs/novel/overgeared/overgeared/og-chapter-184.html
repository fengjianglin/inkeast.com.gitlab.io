 <p><span style="">Chapter 184</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Johnson was a drake with the wind attribute.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It had the advantage of faster movement speeds than other drakes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the most advantageous drake for a pet marathon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Johnson’s master, Pesto, didn’t doubt Johnson’s victory in the pet marathon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He believed that his drake would arrive at the destination first and he would obtain the first gold medal for Italy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Movement speed has dropped by half?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had lost his weapon so easily.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pesto looked at Grid’s pet like it was a ghost.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is that monster?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s pet was a cat. Apart from the wings, it looked exactly like the casts that Pesto knew.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the small mouth in the ‘ㅅ’ shape opened so large that it swallowed a 3m long drake.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a sight so incredible that he couldn’t believe it was happening. It felt like a dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The other participants were also shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What just happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid’s cat just ate Pesto’s drake.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"But the drake is fine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don't be fooled. Look at Pesto's complexion. It is completely white. Something absurd definitely happened.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Indeed, Grid... He wouldn’t carry around an ordinary cat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The pet marathon began in earnest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The 38 drakes, except for Grid and Pesto’s pets who were still at the starting line, flapped their wings and started to fly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The players were relieved.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I don’t know what happened, but it’s good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Johnson was a strong candidate to win.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They weren’t sure about what exactly happened, but it was good news for other players.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They now knew that Grid’s pet wasn’t an ordinary cat, but it didn’t matter to them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The other drakes were already 500m ahead, while Grid and Pesto’s pets were still at the starting line.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The two of them had dropped out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The players were sure of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Keeeok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, Noe was busy burping with a swollen stomach.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Grid prompted him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Start quickly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had become close to Huroi. He experienced Huroi’s drake directly. He had to admire a drake’s speed and stamina.&nbsp;</span><span style="">To be honest, he was skeptical if Noe could afford to be so free.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Noe sent a ridiculing expression towards the uneasy Grid. He placed his pink soles on Grid’s waist and exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is Master a coward, nyang? This is the best body in hell, the lizards can’t defeat me nyang! Don’t rush me! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The east side of the Yurea Island was a mighty mountain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Chingsu Mountain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The pets had to compete to reach the top of Chingsu Mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then Noe declared confidently.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m the fastest! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then a notification window popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your memphis Noe’s movement speed has returned to normal.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The duration of the ‘Soul Ingestion’ effect only lasted for three seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had already confirmed the duration while colliding with Yoshimura during the Hell Gao raid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s expression distorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This stupid cat...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Meanwhile, Pesto’s expression brightened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your drake Johnson’s movement speed has returned to normal.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The effect is huge but the duration is very short!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The delighted Pesto ordered Johnson.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Go forward! Get rid of everyone ahead of you."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kyaooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Johnson responded by vigorously flapping its wings. Then it started to chase the drakes ahead of it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Tremendous speed. This was truly a wind drake.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Noe didn’t fall behind that speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Nyaang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe clung to Johnson’s back and swallowed Johnson again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your drake Johnson’s movement speed has dropped by 50%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pesto was surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This crazy debuff skill, the cooldown time was short? This was totally a scam!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why are you only bothering my Johnson!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pesto cried out angrily after confirming the effect on Johnson.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Noe caught up to the 38 drakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Predation! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe’s mouth was wide open. Then he swallowed the 3m long drakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your memphis Noe’s movement speed has increased by 30%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your memphis Noe’s health has increased by 250%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your memphis Noe’s defense has increased by 500%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your memphis Noe’s attack power has increased by 400%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The owners of the drakes swallowed by Noe were astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your drake Thunder’s movement speed has decreased by 50%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your drake Ultima’s health has decreased by 50%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your drake Bugu’s defense has decreased by 50%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your drake Ole’s attack power has decreased by 50%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What nonsense was this?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The highest stats of their drakes disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kyaack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The drakes swallowed by Noe were completely terrified.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They instinctively recognized a predator higher than them and felt fear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The drakes were confused and lagged behind.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, Noe started to outpace them at an overwhelming speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 What is going on...? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The commentator couldn’t explain the situation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The spectators and viewers were frustrated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The experts were showing great interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『That isn’t just a cat with wings and the ability to speak a human language. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 It is a species that can become partially gigantic! Such creatures are very rare and valuable! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The cat’s momentum rises every time it swallows a drake! This act of swallowing seems to take away the stats of the target! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an accurate analysis.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They weren’t experts for nothing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The spectators and viewers became aware of the greatness of Noe.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Cat-chan is amazing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Using a skill to take away the target’s stats...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Furthermore, the cooldown time is short. Isn’t this completely a scam?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid even has a legendary grade pet!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The world was full of admiration.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Meanwhile, Zibal, who was participating in the pet marathon, grinded his teeth together.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid, this guy...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The United States were the definite winners.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most people and experts predicted that the United States would win with at least five gold medals in this National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the result?&nbsp;</span><span style="">They only won three gold medals.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They didn’t predict that two gold medals would be taken away by South Korea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now at this moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Another gold medal was being taken away.&nbsp;</span><span style="">South Korea would have an equal number of gold medals.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The difference in the silver and bronze medals meant the US would still be first, but their pride was upset. They wouldn’t be happy to win like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">South Korea, the candidate for the worst country, had deprived them of three gold medals?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was all due to Grid!&nbsp;</span><span style="">The US, with its overwhelming power, was suffering due to one person!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This is shameful...! My pride won’t tolerate this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were a total of six American players participating in the pet marathon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As the country with the strongest power, they had the most drake users.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Zibal ordered them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kill that cat!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The feast of breath attacks began.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After that, the drakes poured fire, ice, poison and light breaths at Noe.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Noe was only level 1, so the attacks were quite burdensome on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your memphis Noe’s has suffered 2,430 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After 3 seconds of buffs, all stats returned to normal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Noe’s health was almost halved by the bombardment of breath attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Noe...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was worried.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Noe was the number one demonic beast of hell.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had no opponent except for dragons.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Although he was still young, drakes were on a completely inferior level.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I am angry! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe, who had gone ahead, turned around. Then he grinned at the six US team’s drakes flying towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kyaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe’s fur bristled.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Flinch.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The drakes felt the threat and stopped.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was only for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Attack!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The drakes regained their courage at their master’s command and shot breaths towards Noe or attacked with their tails.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the start of Noe’s full-fledged actions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He used simple movements to avoid the breath and Fluidization to neutralize the tail attacks. Then he opened his mouth again and devoured the stats of all six drakes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kyaooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The drakes panicked!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Noe approached and waved his paws randomly at one of the drakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Scratch Lv. 1]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Your paws will attack and poison the target.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: Whenever you like.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your drake Captain America has suffered 2,900 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[It has become poisoned and is in a petrified state for 3 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Captain America was Zibal’s drake.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Its level was 150.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That little cat’s scratch managed to petrify it for three seconds?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The damage to its health wasn’t too big, but the status condition was huge.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The same was true for the other drakes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were struck by petrification and hung in the air like stone statues. Then they fell towards the ground.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The US team’s drakes shook from the great shock.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Among them, the one with the lowest level turned to grey light.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Noe’s level skyrocketed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your memphis Noe’s level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your memphis Noe’s level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your memphis Noe’s level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your memphis Noe’s level has...]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe gained 26 levels in an instant!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This body is the best demonic beast of hell! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dozens of cameras focused on his roar.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The hundreds of millions of viewers were stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Best demonic beast of hell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That cat is a demonic beast of hell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow... Demonic beasts, I have never seen them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The experts were excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Hell is an unknown land with no information revealed about it! Sometimes, demonic beasts and demonkin emerge from hell as boss monsters, but...! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 He tamed a demonic beast! Grid is indeed amazing! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Kuk...! He is God Grid! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 I would like to analyze that cat that claims to be the best demonic beast of hell. I would be very grateful if God Grid cooperates with me after this tournament. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal stared at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Demonic beast of hell..? Best demonic beast of hell? What the hell are you? You have already gone to hell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid seemed to be an adventurer on an entirely different dimension.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He tamed a beast from uncharted territory?&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was intimidating.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that moment, Zibal and the owners of the drakes, who claimed themselves as ones who mastered the best pets, felt ashamed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The truth was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have never been to hell.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t even know where hell was.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a place he never wanted to visit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid shouted,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Go! Noe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The remaining distance to the goal was 1km.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was no signs that Noe would be defeated after he overpowered the US team’s drakes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At this time, a very good prey was approaching.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was Johnson.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hahahaha! This is a break! Win while that monster cat is distracted by other drakes, Johnson!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The drake passed by the US team’s drakes and Noe.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the moment when the drake that Noe ate twice took the lead.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This drake became good food for Noe.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He ignored the US team’s drakes that he already defeated and swallowed Johnson.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your memphis Noe’s movement speed has increased by 50%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your drake Johnson’s movement speed has dropped by 50%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kek.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The surprised Pesto bit his tongue.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He felt wronged.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Does this skill have no cooldown time?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was ridiculous.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was this truly the best demonic beast of hell?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">And in the end.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Noe arrived first at their destination.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He stood on top of the mountain and waved his short legs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I am the best demonic beast of hell! Nyang! Master’s Noe! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A cat pretending to be Grid’s slave.&nbsp;</span><span style="">People started to feel compassion for it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid, who enslaved a demonic beast, was like the devil.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Grid has won! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was indeed a great figure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He won a gold medal in all three of his events.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And in this pet marathon, the US team couldn’t even acquire a bronze medal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, the overall ranking was determined as the US in first place, South Korea in second place and France in third.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Waaaaaaaah!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Koreans cheered at the unbelievable results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The French were aiming for third in the first place, so they were satisfied.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the Americans had rotten expressions on their faces.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The first place would ‘obviously’ the US, because they had overwhelming power. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">The United States, which was originally supposed to take first place with a bigger difference, barely managed to win because there was only one Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Zibal was bombarded by the media.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was accused of being incompetent as a team leader.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, Grid emerged as the hero of South Korea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The South Korean government provided him with a huge reward of 300 million won per gold medal. There were numerous requests for CFs. He was also flooded with requests from various talk shows and entertainment programs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was time to hire a manager.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“God Grid! God Grid! God Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">000-0 Street, XX Neighbourhood, Geumcheon-gu.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo panicked as he returned home.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A massive crowd of people appeared in his neighbourhood and warmly welcomed him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At the entrance of the neighborhood, the banner stating ‘South Korea’s Hero, God Grid!’ was hung.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the moment when Youngwoo’s image of an unemployed youth freeloading off his parents completely changed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The children, youths and adults of the neighborhood all treated him differently.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At this time, Yura was a great help to Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She was aware that Youngwoo wanted to build a building, so she used her intelligence network and recommended purchasing land where the prices were still low, but would jump up in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After gaining 990 million won and finally barely reaching his target of 10 billion won, Youngwoo immediately bought the land and started construction on a seven-story building with a construction company that Yura recommended.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then Jishuka declared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will build a place next to Grid’s building. I wanted to stay close to Grid anyway.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I was thinking the same thing. I want to be always involved in Taekwondo, except for when I’m playing Satisfy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I like Korean women...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka, Regas and Pon planned to move to South Korea. Most of the Tzedakah Guild made a lot of money from illegal gambling and followed suit. It was because it seemed fun.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura belatedly heard the news and also started construction on a building next to Youngwoo’s. Jishuka became alert.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After that.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to Youngwoo, Yura and the Tzedakah Guild, a certain satellite city in Seoul, which hadn’t flourished yet, was transformed into a luxury building complex.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">And Youngwoo was panicked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was informed of income-related health insurance premiums, pension insurance premiums, income tax, land tax, and building tax.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid had to pay fees to the item trading site when converting Satisfy’s gold to cash, so he shed tears of blood when the tax bomb hit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">For a while, he was in a deficit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was very stressed and suffered from hair loss until Yura recommended a talented tax consultant to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
