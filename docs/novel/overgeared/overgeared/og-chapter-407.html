 <p><span style="">Chapter 407</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Cloak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It referred to a coat hanging from the shoulders without any sleeves.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From a general point of view, tailors made cloaks because the commonly used materials were cloth and leather.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But blacksmiths also knew how to make cloaks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was natural.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Blacksmiths made all types of leather armor, and due to this they were also skilled at making cloaks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Of course, it was a reality that the options and designs lagged behind cloaks made by tailors, since they were specialists in cloth and leather. However, the blacksmith cloaks had better basic defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">From that point of view, Lantier’s Cloak was clearly made by a blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The cloak stopped my blade.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was the quality and elasticity of the cloak that it couldn’t even be torn by Noe’s claws?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid thought about it during his return journey to Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He actively used his knowledge and experience as Pagma’s Descendant, looking at every type of leather.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The leather he came up with?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘None.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Of course, there were some leathers that were as hard as rocks that were excellent in defense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Typical examples were minotaur leather and blue griffin leather.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In fact, they were used as materials for the best leather armor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But they weren’t appropriate as a material for a cloak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s too thick and heavy. They aren’t soft enough, despite being leather.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Making a cloak with it?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rather than a cloak, it was more like a box. There was no utility as a cloak.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If so, what was Lantier’s Cloak made out of?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I bet it isn’t cloth.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pagma had prepared the equipment for Lantier, who became a death knight. Pagma was a blacksmith, so he couldn’t handle cloth at a high level.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Wait.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A smile appeared on Grid’s face as he recalled something.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He remembered that with Lantier’s Cloak, the inside and outside were different colors.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The outer part is black.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">And the inner lining was red.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Pagma used two types of leather to increase the defense of the cloak.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Once he realized this, he knew that he didn’t have to cling to minotaur or griffin leather.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The durability might be lower, but there were more suitable leathers to make the cloak.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now Grid went through the different types of leather to find a red and black one.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘...None?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The black leather wasn’t too much trouble, but there was no red leather. The only one similar to red leather was the pink leather of the lizard queen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The lizard queen’s leather is too hard to be used as the inner lining of the cloak...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the past week, Grid had completed his armor, helmet, and leggings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He faced a challenge when he tried to recreate Lantier’s Cloak using the Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation skill.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Her eyes were confident and her mouth relaxed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura was filled with unique intellectual charm and was the most beautiful woman in Asia.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her hairstyle had changed somehow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her ebony hair fell down and reached her chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I am ashamed.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura blushed as she stood in a full-length mirror.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The pink flush on her white face was reminiscent of a peach.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It feels awkward.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Her short dress revealed her thighs. It highlighted Yura’s ideal figure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura normally wore jeans, simple t-shirts, or suits, so she couldn’t adapt to her appearance in the mirror.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She shivered shyly at the thought of going out with her body exposed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Honestly, she wanted to change her clothes right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘But.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Today she was meeting Grid. In other words, she was meeting Shin Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She wanted to increase her favorability with the first man she was interested in.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, she changed her style.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was to match Grid’s taste.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The problem was her breast size.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Didn’t Grid like at least a D cup?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura thought about borrowing the power of items, but shook her head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a matter of pride. She was already bigger than average.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On this day.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I don’t care if I die right now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The men who witnessed Yura on the streets cried out emotionally, regardless of their age.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were some people who vowed never to wash their eyes.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ding dong~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">There were 3 days remaining until the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Someone visited Youngwoo’s house.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh~! God Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo frowned in dislike at his loud voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You’re as lively as ever.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I have to welcome God Grid, so of course I will be energetic!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah, really.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword was like Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were people who had an infinite affection towards Grid. He couldn’t be disgusted by such people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Shin Youngwoo laughed and wore slippers onto the porch.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hoh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Light blue old slippers and a green training suit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword was impressed as he looked Youngwoo up and down.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo’s body was much fitter than it was several months ago. His broad shoulders and thick thighs were very good.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Last time, you were jogging every morning. Now it seems like you are constantly working out as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I need to be healthy so I can focus more on the game.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t play the game without stamina. In particular, the fatigue of virtual reality games was very high.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is a very good attitude. But what are those severe dark circles under your eyes? Have you been sleeping lately?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m making a few items before the National Competition... Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo, who came out of the house, discovered the car that Peak Sword was standing next to and felt astonished.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword saw his expression and asked earnestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“How is it? Isn’t my new car very good? It is a rare sports sedan that can stand side-by-side next to God Grid’s 800 million won 13 series. Right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Moonlight blue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo was paying attention to the color of Peak Sword’s car.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was blue under the sunlight, but black when in the shade.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Don’t tell me...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The red leather that made up Lantier’s Cloak.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It might not be red.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After remembering that the 61st island was covered with flames, Youngwoo was enlightened and rushed into his house.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I’m going back into the game!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh? H-Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword panicked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wasn’t today the day when he promised to attend the operational meeting with the participations of the Korean national team?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now he was going to one-sidedly withdraw from that promise?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We can work out the plans, but Yura will be disappointed...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura and Peak Sword were friends since a long time ago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword one-sidedly followed Yura after joining the ‘Do you know club?’, but he could still be regarded as a friend.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, after their reunion in the Overgeared Guild, they became closer and Peak Sword was able to notice that Yura was attracted to Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She would be worried about what to wear today, but Youngwoo...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Well, this is fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was God Grid, who broke the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The only Korean player who could be viewed as Satisfy’s best.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword didn’t want to disturb him. He respected Youngwoo’s choice, since it would eventually boost the status of South Korea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As a result, Yura became depressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Youngwoo-ssi isn’t coming?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah, eh, yes...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The finest Korean restaurant in Gangnam.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura, who was waiting for Youngwoo and Peak Sword with the other participants of the National Competition, changed clothes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She put on a white shirt and jeans instead of the alluring one piece dress that showed off her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The men in the room were forced to blame Youngwoo, while the women could be freed from their feelings of self-consciousness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes, this is it! Why didn’t I think of this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Reidan’s super large smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As soon as he reconnected to the game, Grid opened the ‘Item Production List’ and cheered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The item he was looking at was the leather armor that he gave to Faker a few months back.</span></p>

 <p><span style="">It was shown that Lantier’s Cloak could neutralize Noe’s claws and stay in the blazing fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Due to the high elasticity, a synergy will occur when it is attached to other leather. Then wouldn’t it be good to use the leather of the puri minotaur?</span></p>
