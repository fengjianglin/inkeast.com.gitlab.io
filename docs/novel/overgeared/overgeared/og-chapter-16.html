 <p>Chapter 16</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>[You are now level 1. Your stats, which were fixed to a minimum due to the minus level penalty, have been restored to their normal state.]</p>
 <p><span style="">[The basic stats of Pagma’s Descendant have been applied.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">These were phrases that made my heart pound in anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Dugun dugun!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">My heart was beating so fast, it found like the sound was coming up to my ears.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was extremely excited and hurriedly opened the status window.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Name: Grid&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level: 1 (45/100)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Class: Pagma’s Descendant</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The probability of adding additional options when making items will increase.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The probably of item enhancement will increase.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* All equipment items can be worn unconditionally. However, there will be a penalty depending on the rating of the item.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Title: One who Became a Legend</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Abnormal conditions don’t work well on you.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* You won’t die when health is at the minimum.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Easily acknowledged.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Health: 280/280 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana: 75/75</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Strength: 20 + 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 18 &nbsp;&nbsp;Agility: 12 &nbsp;Intelligence: 25&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dexterity: 50 &nbsp;Persistence: 16</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Composure: 10 &nbsp;Indomitable: 11 &nbsp;&nbsp;Dignity: 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;Insight: 10</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Stat Points: 40</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 3,035/820</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The weight limit exceeds 200%, so movement speed is reduced by 100%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The body is heavy and cannot exert any power properly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The probability of receiving the ‘weakened’ state has become really high.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A dream?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was it a dream?&nbsp;</span><span style="">I didn’t panic. If I were in reality, I would’ve pinched myself. However, I just calmly logged out of the game.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I lay in the capsule in my room and stared for a few moments.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I was sleeping without knowing it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was a good possibility because I didn’t have the capsule switched to sleep mode.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I went to the bathroom to resolve my bodily needs, poured cold water over my head, and returned to the capsule. I logged in again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Just like in my dream, I was standing in the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Was it not a dream...? No, I shouldn’t anticipate anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If an unlucky person like me started expecting things, the wounds on my heart would also grow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I opened the status window without any inspiration and literally froze.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...An amazing jackpot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were no changes to the contents of the status window.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t a dream.&nbsp;</span><span style="">My heart started beating quickly again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The basic stats of a level 1 character were 6 strength, 7 stamina, 4 agility, and 5 intelligence. In other words, the total number of stats for a level 1 character was 22 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, the basic stats of Pagma’s Descendant added up to 165 points in total. In addition, there were the 16 points in persistence that I grew as well as 1 point in indomitable, making a huge total of 182 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Using simple calculations, my stats were higher than level 15 users, which meant that I had an overwhelming advantage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I realized the greatness of a legendary profession.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Besides...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘These are just the basic stats but...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I paid attention to the extra 40 stat points I had.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Why was I given stat points?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Stat points were increased by 10 points every time someone gained a level, so I should have 0 points at level 1.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, I pondered upon the reason why I was given 40 points.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were many theories, but there was only one hypothesis that was persuasive.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Perhaps... are stat points obtained every time you level up, even at the minus level?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was level -3 and leveled up four times in order to reach level 1. This was the only reason I could think of for the 40 stat points.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I rubbed my eyes but the 40 stat points didn’t disappear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was so thrilled that I starting shaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘My experience in the minus level wasn’t in vain!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">All of my struggles were meaningful.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Maybe I wasn’t as unlucky as I thought was.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk! Kukuk...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was there a language in this world that could express this joy?&nbsp;</span><span style="">I could only laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Puhahahahahat ~ ~ ~ ~!!!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The sound of my laughter was proportional to my joy. The people in the smithy left as I laughed so loudly that my belly hurt. However, I just couldn’t stop.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After a while,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"He! Keke! Puha...! Urghh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Smith stared at me as I laughed through the pain and raised his thumb.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"This is a hero’s excited laugh! You are such an outstanding figure that I don’t know how I mistook your identity yesterday. My vision was lacking. I am ashamed and embarrassed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I laughed like a madman but he still saw me as a hero?&nbsp;</span><span style="">This meant that Smith’s affinity with me was at the maximum.&nbsp;</span><span style="">While it was true that I had escaped from the minus level, raised my affinity with two quests, and earned a reputation in Bairan Village of over 200, Smith’s attitude towards me was still overly flattering.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Even if my title has the attribute of being easily acknowledged...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I met Smith’s eyes, causing him to lower his gaze. This was the attitude of a student in the presence of his master!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is this the effect of the dignity stat? It’s only at 10 points at the moment, but is it already having an effect?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was possible, considering that Smith’s level wasn’t very high.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It might be different with high ranking NPCs. However, dignity seems to have an effect on normal NPCs, even with the number of points in it isn’t high.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I never imagined that his attitude would change so much in a day. It was an excitement beyond my current excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘...First, let’s calm down. Let’s calm down and try to figure out how the stat points work.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I worried about it for a moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Over the past few days, hadn’t I acted in an impromptu manner without thinking deeply?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now that the situation was getting better, I needed to be more cautious. It felt like numerous threads were tangled in front of me that could be ruined with my rash behavior.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I already have a lot of stats at level 1, so there is absolutely no reason to distribute my stat points hastily.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I thought about the most important thing to me right now.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Money!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yes, money. I needed to make enough money in order to pay for the carriage to move between villages.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Smith flinched as I suddenly shouted. I cut straight to the point,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Didn’t I say it when I first visited your smithy? I want to make and sell high-demand items that will make me as much profit as possible. What is the most appropriate item?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Smith pointed to a place where arrows were displayed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An arrow?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Unlike other equipment, arrows were consumables, so the price of it was naturally cheaper. No matter how profitable it was, if the sale price was low, it meant that I had to sell a lot of volume. My spirit deflated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Smith read my expression and explained,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This isn’t an ordinary arrow. It is a special arrow made by mixing a small amount of jaffa with steel, allowing it to ignore some of the enemy’s defense and cause damage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ignore defense!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">For archers who participated in the Guardian of the Forest raise, these arrows were essential. No, even if it were for players not participating in the raid, the demand would be high considering there were many golems living in the Grey Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Jaffa...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Smith saw that I was interested and brought out a light purple mineral from the warehouse.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Jaffa is a mineral with a low oxygen content, making it easy to smelt, and is remarkably superior to iron. Its weakness is its durability and strength, making it unsuitable to create weapons with jaffa. However, when mixed with steel, the durability increases and the penetration power is maximized. It is normal for cavalry troops to be armed with jaffa-tipped spears.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It must be expensive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It is two gold per kilogram. Even top-tier iron ore is just cheap stone in front of jaffa.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Expensive... Then, how can you produce dozens of jaffa arrows?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No, it isn’t expensive. Only a small amount of jaffa is needed to create the arrow. The production cost of a single jaffa arrow is three silver, but the sales price is fixed at six silver. It is double the profit. In addition, this village has a high demand for jaffa arrows. How about it, do you want to learn how to make it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If this were yesterday, I would’ve nodded since I could gain a quick understanding through the appraisal skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But I wasn’t the same. After receiving a recommendation for a suitable item, I needed to learn how to make it myself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Show me the arrow for a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Smith handed me the arrow and I used the appraisal skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Jaffa Arrow]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Normal</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Attack Power: 20~26</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An arrow made by mixing a small amount of jaffa with steel.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Due to the effect of combining jaffa with steel, it has extremely high penetration and ignores some of the enemy’s defense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 0.1&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A hidden function doesn’t exist.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have grasped the Jaffa Arrow’s material composition, production method, and intentions of its creator.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your understanding of the Jaffa Arrow is now at 89%. You will be able to use the Jaffa Arrow skillfully.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Unfortunately, I couldn’t reach 100% understanding after using appraisal on the Jaffa Arrow. Therefore, the production method wasn’t added.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'This arrow...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Smith looked at me staring at the arrow and asked again,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Do you want to learn how to make the Jaffa Arrow?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If I use the item disassembly skill, I might be able to raise the remaining 11%... But one arrow is six silver?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I would need to pay six silver if I wanted to disassemble it. I couldn’t afford that type of luxury.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It isn’t too bad to learn how to make it on my own.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I nodded in agreement.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I will learn how to make it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Smith was happy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I thought so. First, shall we learn how to smelt the mineral?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Smith began with the structure of the old furnace commonly used by all blacksmiths in Satisfy, explaining in detail the elements necessary for the smelting process and the principles behind the process.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Blacksmith jargon and chemical terms sometimes popped up, but I didn’t feel confused.&nbsp;</span><span style="">While Satisfy pursued realism, it was still a game so the barrier wasn’t set high in order to allow more people to enjoy it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The blacksmith knowledge required by Satisfy was as easy to understand as the other classes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In addition, I came prepared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I had been unable to connect after receiving a penalty for dying twice in one day, so I used the spare time to research blacksmithing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Smith’s lecture wasn’t much different from the smelting method I read about. Thus, it was easier to understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I realized the effect of preparation and review.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was fortunate that one of my friends from middle school had taught me the ‘preparation and review’ method.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘But that guy wasn’t able to escape the second place ranking all through high school.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was a pitiful guy who maintained his second rank in high school, never being able to cross the wall of a classmate who claimed to ‘only study in class.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the day the results of the second semester final examinations were released, I was able to understand the feelings of my friend who stood on the rooftop and yelled ‘Why did a genius have to be born in the same year as me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were many talented people that I could never catch up to, no matter how hard I tried.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘But now things are different.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I got a legendary class. This time, I would be the outstanding person. I would achieve as much as possible.</span></p>
