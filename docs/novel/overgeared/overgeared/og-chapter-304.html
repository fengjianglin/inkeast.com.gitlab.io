 <p><span style="">Chapter 304</span></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">[Three pieces of ??? have been collected.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The information about the ??? Pieces has been updated.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttiring~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[Red Mirror Piece]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pieces of a round mirror made of blood stones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The exact function of the mirror isn’t known.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The third prince of the Saharan Empire is looking for this mirror. It is recommended that you gather all the pieces and give them to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 3</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid verified the updated information of the unknown pieces. Then another item passed through his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Amethyst Shield!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Amethyst Shield]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 200&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Defense: 200 &nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Resistance: 200</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A beautiful shield that shines purple, red, or black depending on the angle. It is a symbolic piece that is awarded only to the head of the Red Knights.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an item lost three years ago when Piaro, who was framed as a traitor by Asmophel, fled to the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The third prince of the Saharan Empire is looking for this shield. It is recommended that you bring it to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 350</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an item he acquired more than a year ago in Satisfy time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Awakened Guardian of the Forest had dropped it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">How could he meet a prince of the empire?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had placed the item in his inventory and forgotten about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The performance isn’t very good, but I kept it because it’s a quest item.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How could he have forgotten about it...?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Well, a busy person can forget about the little things.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His memory wasn’t bad.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had a habit of getting involved in incidents every day, so he rationalized it to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Anyway, there seems to be a big episode since the empire’s third prince is always mentioned.'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Could he get a hint from Piaro, the owner of the Amethyst Shield?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Once this expedition is over, I should talk with Piaro.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid determined and checked the remaining items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">First was Iyarugt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Legendary Blacksmith’s Appraisal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The blacksmith who became a legend can appraise items with an excellent discerning eye. If a hidden feature exists in the target item, it will be found.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Iyarugt]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Unique (Growth)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 351/351 &nbsp;Attack Power: 793</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Sword Mastery Level +5.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The skill ‘Blood Cry’ is generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Decreases the healing ability of the target by 50% when they are hit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* A critical strike will cause a bleeding status that will last for 3 seconds. The bleeding damage will be proportional to your attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The target’s bleeding effect will be maximized when three combos are achieved. At this time, the damage done to the target will increase by 200% for 1 second.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When five combos are achieved, the target’s thinking ability will be destroyed for 0.3 seconds. At this time, you can link the skill ‘Hell Sword.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Iyarugt is a sword made by the only blacksmith of hell, out of a soul and blood stones.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It has exceptional damage for a one-handed sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soul of Iyarugt will turn the wearer into a master of swordsmanship. However, he rarely accepts anyone as a master.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Conditions of Use: A person chosen by Iyarugt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 290</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A hidden function doesn’t exist.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Amazing...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A legendary rated two-handed sword had an attack power of 1,040~2,166.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, Iyarugt was a unique rated one-handed sword, but its attack power was close to 800.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was a tremendous number considering the fact that two-handed swords normally had more attack power, while one-handed swords normally had more speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It also increases the level of Sword Mastery by 5. The average damage might rise or fall slightly compared to Failure. It will be far superior if it’s raised to a legendary rating.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an excellent sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The material was far superior to blue orichalcum, but there was also the skills of the blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Hell’s only blacksmith...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Helmis.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A demonkin he met when he died in the Blackening State and fell to hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is it his work?’&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was strange.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘He seems to have an affinity with the blacksmithing class itself... If we meet again, will he teach me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was filled with expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he didn’t want to go to hell.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Of course, hell was very different from his imagination. It was a peaceful world with a clear blue sky and grasslands. The demonkin were also surprisingly friendly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, he shouldn’t be misled by appearances.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A rash decision was always poisonous.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Hell is the land of evil.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He should avoid that place, as long as he didn’t know what risks might be present.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid dismissed the reunion with Helmis and examined Elfin Stone’s Ring next.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The blacksmith who became a legend can appraise items with an excellent discerning eye. If a hidden feature exists in the target item, it will be found.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Elfin Stone’s Ring]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Epic (Growth)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* During normal attacks, 12% of the damage done to the target will be restored to you as health.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* During skill attacks, 5% of the damage done to the target will be restored to you as health.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* This effect is only invoked once every 21 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Strength, stamina and health +20</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A ring that contains Earl Elfin Stone’s unique magic power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It raises the potential and survival ability of the wearer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 1</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is also amazing...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In Satisfy, a potion’s cooldown time was long and healers were precious, so the value of a vampire’s ring was astronomical.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In addition, Elfin Stone’s Ring was applied to skill attacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was a unique feature that went against common sense, and the compatibility with Grid’s legendary skills was excellent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The only thing lacking was that the cooldown time was 21 seconds, but that wasn’t a huge disadvantage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It gives me a 60 point stat bonus...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Wasn’t it like gaining six levels?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s heart pumped.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was glad about obtaining another top quality accessory after Doran’s Ring and Dark Bus’ Ring. It was worth sacrificing his life to succeed in this raid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A notification window popped up in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[This item has a hidden function.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The information of Elfin Stone’s Ring has been updated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was amazed to see the true function of Elfin Stone’s Ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* If this ring grows to a legendary rating, the wearer can summon Vampire Earl Elfin Stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Uh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was able to summon the strongest and worst boss?&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was no mention of whether the summoned person would be a subordinate, or if he would still be hostile to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But if he thought about it with common sense, Elfin Stone was more likely to be his subordinate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid clenched his fists tightly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was thrilled as he imagined Elfin Stone becoming his slave.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, there was one thing that bothered him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid turned to stare at the party members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"All of you should know the value of these items. It’s too burdensome for me to gobble them up alone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The party members smiled brightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t you normally do this for us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We can get items from a legendary blacksmith for free, as long as we provide the materials.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Besides, don’t forget that the main player in this raid is Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"In the first place, we wouldn’t have raided Elfin Stone if it wasn’t for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Everyone...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was deeply grateful for their help with his quest, as well as giving him such consideration.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Where in the world did such nice and kind friends existed?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid vowed yet again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had to return double the grace they showed to him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But before that, there was something he needed to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Jishuka. Please fire Phoenix Arrow here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh? Why?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Phoenix Arrow was a symbol of Jishuka’s authority, as well as her ultimate skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the strongest skill that summoned a fire bird and turned the whole area into a sea of fire.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why did Grid want her to use Phoenix Arrow here?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid pointed towards the pavranium that Jishuka had given him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“To smelt this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka recalled a disgraceful moment from the past.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had wanted her to use her ultimate skill as a substitute for a blast furnace. Her pride was upset.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, she couldn’t refuse her guild master just because of pride.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Moreover, Yura was also present. Jishuka wanted to prove that she was better than Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka used Phoenix Arrow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a tremendous decision considering her normal prideful personality.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her colleagues looked at her with a pitying gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid’s attitude towards women is too lacking.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'He isn’t delicate...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Our poor Jishuka. Falling in love with an uncaring guy like that.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid became a bad guy who devoted himself to making an item.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Using the fire that Phoenix Arrow generated, he smelted the pavranium and attached it to Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a result, a small handle was attached to Lifael’s Spear. It meant that he could swing Lifael’s Spear by holding it in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But it still wasn’t complete.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In order to truly be reborn as Lifael’s Spear, he needed to acquire the remaining 14 pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If I collect all 14 pavranium...'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The length of the handle had to be increased in order to enhance the spear to its best performance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that time, it would be truly reborn as Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Its power would be comparable or even higher than Iyarugt’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Give me any equipment you want repaired."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid reached out to his party members. Then they entrusted him with the items that were damaged during the course of the city raid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Indeed, Grid was a legendary blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were dozens of items to be repaired. His speed was several times faster than ordinary blacksmiths.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s true power was revealed when he was holding the hammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After that.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let's depart."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After the maintenance, Grid’s party left the 13th city and headed towards the 14th city.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They planned to conquer the 14th and 15th cities first, then start sequentially from 12 down to 1.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were tired at the thought of all the city masters being like Elfin Stone, but the party didn’t shrink back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was because Grid’s increased strength and the addition of Yura raised the morale of the party.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unlike the concerns of the party, the expedition proceeded smoothly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The masters of the 14th and 15th cities were only barons, not earls.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were ridiculously weak compared to Elfin Stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Indeed, if vampires like Elfin Stone were so common, then this world would’ve already been dominated by vampires.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The party was able to deduce that the difficulty of the 13th city was exceptionally high.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Only Grid was suffering among the party members who had regained their composure.</span></p>
