 <p><span style="">Chapter 328</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Reina.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The leader of the popular girl group Farina, she fell in love with Doohyun at first sight two years ago and confessed to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The result?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was cold.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She had received many confessions, but it was her first experience with being rejected.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Reina received a big shock and her pride was shattered. Love transformed into love-hate, and love-hate turned into obsession.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She spread rumors that she was dating Doohyun, causing severe damage to his image.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Reina who gave Doohyun the stigma of a high school girl killer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kim Doohyun...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Last year, as soon as her CSATs were over, Reina started dating Go Jimyung. But she was still obsessed with Doohyun.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the first place, she dated Go Jimyung in order to induce Doohyun’s jealousy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, there were no results until today.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Do you think that I will let you flirt with other girls?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Reina was trying to do something crazy once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Shin Sehee.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pretty. No, to be honest, she was a very pretty girl. She looked prettier than Reina, despite all the makeup Reina wore.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was she just pretty?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her grades were in the top of the country and she got a hidden class in Satisfy. She was even the sister of the famous Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In other words, a perfect daughter-in-law.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">According to Reina’s conjecture, Doohyun attended the festival in order to seduce Sehee. Why else would a world star participate in a high school festival?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Reina had no intention of forgiving Sehee.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She planned to use Go Jimyung to thoroughly trample on Sehee.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I’m too late.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The fighting competition’s waiting room.&nbsp;</span><span style="">By the time Doohyun arrived, it was Sehee’s turn. She was standing next to the two Satisfy capsules on the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘We will talk after the match.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A smile appeared on Doohyun’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He imagined a scene where he became friendly with Sehee and Grid, then he would meet Noe one day.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Doohyun’s smile didn’t last long.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because he saw that Go Jimyung was Sehee’s first opponent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Perhaps...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doohyun knew better than anyone that Reina wasn’t a normal person.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was it really a coincidence that her lover participated in this festival and faced Sehee?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, the odds weren’t great.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doohyun ran off somewhere.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">'Oh my, she looks so beautiful.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Announcer Lee Minjung had great skills and a beautiful appearance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reason why she was able to climb to the position of top MC was because she was aware of how to use her beauty.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, even she paled in front of Sehee.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Big eyes and a small face. Sehee looked like a doll. There was a reason the press called her Little Yura. It was an unusual beauty.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The discouraged Lee Minjung suddenly regained her spirit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She shouted towards the audience members who were watching the stage with shining eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"From now on, I will start the Young Ladies High School’s Satisfy fighting competition. But before that, shouldn’t we first take the time to talk with the participants?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lee Minjung’s ability was outstanding.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She increased the atmosphere by interviewing the nervous Sehee and excited Go Jimyung.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Once the audience’s excitement reached its peak, Announcer Lee Minjung finally announced the beginning of the first match.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Waaahhhhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Sehee, have strength!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Go Jimyung! Just like when you play baseball!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee and Go Jimyung entered the capsules as the crowd cheered.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Rania Coast.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lights flashed in the place designated as the stage for the competition, before scattering like glass fragments.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The sparkling light reflected off the sea shone on the white clothes of the beautiful girl who appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She was Ruby, Shin Sehee.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Sigh, a hidden class has a gorgeous effect when logging in.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Go Jimyung pulled out a mace and approached Sehee.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He spoke in a very small voice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"A brother and sister both got a hidden class, do you have a relationship with the S.A. Group? Will you introduce me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee didn’t answer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From the beginning, she didn’t like Go Jimyung.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because she felt that Go Jimyung had a hostile relationship towards her. In particular, the wily look in his eyes was uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Go Jimyung frowned,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Not answering, are you ashamed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Just start.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee replied bluntly and sent an invitation for a spar.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Go Jimyung refused,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Look at how rude you are. Grid’s personality is the same, so aren’t you truly siblings?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee’s eyes sank coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Are you messing with my family?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I never said anything. I just told the truth!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Buuong.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Go Jimyung wielded his mace as hard as he could. It wasn’t the usual form of swinging it since he was a top batter.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sehee couldn’t avoid the hit and coughed up blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 1,880 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee was only level 116. She was focused on her studies so she didn’t have much time to play the game.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the armur that Grid produced for her was epic rated and its performance was unrivalled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to this, Sehee was able to endure the attack of the level 187 Go Jimyung without a fatal injury.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Go Jimyung’s expression distorted further.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? Why are you only bleeding this much? Oh, aren’t you Overgeared’s little sister?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Didn’t you get the application for a spar?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, but you can’t kill people in sparring mode.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Can you afford the storm that will happen? A famous baseball player ignoring the rules of the game and killing a high school girl, there will be public criticism.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I don’t care about the public’s opinion. I only want to be loved by my goddess. In the first place, I will retire without renewing my contract after this season.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You aren’t even 30 years old. It seems a bit disappointing to retire already.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kukuk! Is it disappointing? Do you know my annual salary after travelling back and forth between Korea and Japan for years? It is an average of 10.2 billion, 10.2 billion! I have enough money for my sick brother to not have to work for the rest of his life!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was nothing else to be said.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sehee sighed and used Hope.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a top rated healing skill that consumed 10% of her mana to restore 10~30% of her health.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your mana has fallen by 816 after using the skill Hope.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[2,005 health has been restored after using the skill Hope.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It won’t be easy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was inevitable for celebrities to have anti-fans, and Grid had many toxic anti-fans.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sehee believed that her brother was the reason why Go Jimyung was hostile towards her, and she didn’t want to lose.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This person who disliked her brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is hateful!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have worn the +9 Wooden Staff.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was her class-exclusive weapon that Grid enhanced.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sehee swung it. Go Jimyung avoided the ridiculous attack and laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Puhahat! What is that wooden stick? Did you steal the stick that my sick grandmother used?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Go Jimyung’s mace descended.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a warrior with a blunt weapon as his primary weapon, so he wasn’t very agile. Sehee was able to respond to it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She raised the wooden staff with both hands and blocked the attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Uh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The difference in strength was too big.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sehee’s stats were aimed towards stamina and intelligence, so her strength was very low.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A warning window flashed in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have received a great shock, paralyzing both arms for one second.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One second paralysis in a battle was fatal. It was the perfect opportunity for the opponent to link their attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, this wasn’t a problem for Sehee.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have resisted thanks to the effect of Upright Heart.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the power of her class.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Go Jimyung frowned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The lower levelled Sehee blocked the successive attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'This staff, is it a legendary weapon?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The material looked like ordinary wood, but a white light was surrounding it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Would someone really bother to enhance an ordinary wooden staff to +9?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was certainly an unusual weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It looks like Grid made it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A dark smile appeared on Go Jimyung’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Overgeared?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He also had it!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Didn't I tell you? I have a lot of money. Do you think I’m armed with common items?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Hwaruruk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Then Go Jimyung’s mace started to emit huge flames.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the majesty of a unique rated weapon.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kyaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee wasn’t accustomed to PK and screamed when she could no longer defend.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The flames that constantly came from Go Jimyung’s flames were painful.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sehee used her two healing skills, but the cooldown time was 1 minute and 30 seconds, and 3 minutes, so she could only receive damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee’s body became darkened and Go Jimyung was convinced that he would win.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo was foul-mouthed. The people who heard it couldn’t help turning red.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His number of curses increased after he became friends with Huroi.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It meant Huroi was an effective teacher.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Of course, this was when he maintained his reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This crazy bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo finally got up from where he was sitting in the audience and rushed somewhere.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t tolerate the situation that was happening on the monitor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Go Jimyung’s ID turned red the moment he attacked Sehee.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This proved that the confrontation between the two people wasn’t in sparring mode, but was an ordinary PK.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hey, these #%@!% organizers! What are you doing? Sehee is in danger!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A person wearing a doll mask screamed. He was glad that no one knew who he was.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword calmed Youngwoo down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Look backstage. The management is around Go Jimyung’s capsule. They will soon normalize the situation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Calm down?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo struck Peak Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At this moment, his worry for his sister allowed him to temporarily overcome a taekwondo master.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Oh my!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword fell on his butt as Youngwoo ran straight for the stage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yerim watched him with a rapt expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cool.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yerim had been watching in her ghost costume.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was fascinated by Youngwoo’s appearance and exhaled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is he like this in bed?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The men gazed at the excited Yerim and immediately got nosebleeds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yerim’s innate power of seduction was too excessive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Perhaps she was a succubus in a past life.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will connect and mediate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Behind Sehee and Go Jimyung’s capsules.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kim Doohyun and the organizers were standing beside an extra capsule prepared for these type of situations.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A warning message has already been delivered to Go Jimyung. He will soon calm down and switch to sparring mode, so don’t worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"He intentionally avoided a spar in the first place! Let me directly connect!”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Doohyun cried out furiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But the organizers were frustrating to deal with.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Haha, what reason would Go Jimyung have to do that? Doohyun-ssi, please calm down. A third party’s entry into the contest will cause a disruption to the schedule. As you know, those who are participating in the competition have a tight schedule because they are VIPs...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Get lost!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doohyun and the organizers suddenly flew back. It was because a man in a doll mask ran between them and gave a drop kick.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eek! What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Me?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The unidentified man opened the capsule without permission.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he threw off the doll mask.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The eyes of the organizers and Doohyun widened as soon as the man’s face was exposed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“G-Grid...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, I am Sehee’s brother. So don’t interfere. And you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doohyun was confused about being pointed out by Grid. Youngwoo growled at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Don’t think that you can create a dramatic scenario so that you can save Sehee like a white prince.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why was he saying?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Doohyun was baffled while Youngwoo sat in the capsule and logged into Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Iris recognition...]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The user’s information has been completed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The user isn’t registered with this capsule. Checking the capsule information...]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A S.A. Group approved event capsule. Capsule number 31F000B4C.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The log in location is forcefully designated as Rania Coast.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A legendary presence, welcome!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The familiar and unfamiliar notification windows alternated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Heok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“O-Oppa?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid, Sehee and Go Jimyung faced each other.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The burning mace hitting Sehee like a sandbag was stopped due to Go Jimyung’s shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid! Why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Go Jimyung? You are permanently forbidden access to the Eternal Kingdom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Someday he would be the king of the Eternal Kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He could say such remarks because of this thought.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Go Jimyung’s teeth grinded together at Grid’s declaration.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You are just the master of Overgeared! You don’t have the authority to say this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Just Overgeared?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This low level person was treated Overgeared so lightly?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The most important element in the game was items, and the power of items was great.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Then I won’t use items to defeat you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid spoke meaningfully and raised a finger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Go Jimyung and the thousands of people watching were confused.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Magic Missile."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A white flash shot out from Grid’s finger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Go Jimyung was hit in the heart and blood emerged from his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Keook...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How could Magic Missile do so much damage?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Go Jimyung couldn’t believe it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid aimed at the stricken Go Jimyung again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Magic Missile."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuaaaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At this moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The number one search term on the portal sites was Magic Missile.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The second place search query was ‘Grid’s Magic Missile learning method,’ not Grid.</span></p>
