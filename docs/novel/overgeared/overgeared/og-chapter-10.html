 <p><span style="">Chapter 10</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Going to the Mubaid Ruins, one must be level 130 or higher!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Looking for those who want to hunt in the Grey Forest ~ A level 130 warrior is waiting for people higher than level 96~”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Recruiting people for the Guardian of the Forest raid! A level 190 archer, level 181 martial artist, and other top rankers will join! Your class and level don’t matter! Anyone will do!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">When I accessed the game, I stood in a town square.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I couldn’t resurrect at the Yatan Temple due to being in a hostile relationship with the Yatan Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Bairan Village?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the place I visited before proceeding with Ashur’s quest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I frowned as I recalled the past memories.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I got turned around.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The monsters near Bairan Village were at least level 100. In addition, they were all ferocious monsters.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The level of users here was at least the mid-80s, and they always needed a party when hunting. It was a dangerous place where users below level 120 couldn’t leave the village alone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the past, I wandered around here alone while searching for the Northern End Cave and died. At that time, the durability of some of my equipment was reduced to zero and my boots and gauntlets shattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I ended up resurrecting at this place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Maybe I was some stupid god in my past life. I probably dishonoured Lady Luck in my past life, then my memories were erased and I was banished to the human world. Since then, I lived an unlucky life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is true. I can’t be so unlucky unless I sinned directly against the goddess of luck.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I placed my forehead on a wall and blamed my past life. I couldn’t be here forever, so I recovered my spirit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I should go to another village.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Right now, the urgent thing was to raise my level. I wanted to escape from the minus level as soon as possible. There was no reason to stay in a village where hunting was impossible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I found a horse-drawn carriage waiting for customers in a corner of the square and asked the coachman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What is the safest village near here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Winston Village. Many novice travelers visit that place. Do you need a driver to take you there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"How much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The coachman raised one finger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a crook.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Carriages were means of transportation for the rich: they were tremendous luxuries for debt-ridden people like me. It was a luxury comparable to eating a whole marinated chicken for one meal!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But there was nothing I could do. Right now, it was impossible for me to move to another village with my own power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If I left the village, I would only walk a little bit before dying.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">I handed over one silver while shedding tears.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The coachman looked at me.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“What are you doing? It is 10 gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I made a surprised expression, as if I really didn’t know.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Heok! 10 gold? It is 10 gold, not 10 silver?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This must be the first time you are taking a carriage. In the safe zone, the base fare for a carriage is set at five gold. In a monster-infested area such as this, there should be some profit for the high risk. This price is actually cheap. Winston is close to here, so it is only the basic fare.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You are charging so much just for driving a carriage!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Tsk tsk, this is why I don’t like novice travelers. Don’t you know that all the monsters in the vicinity will attack as soon as they find humans?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No! I know that there aren’t any monsters fast enough to catch up to the speed of a carriage!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The coachman flinched. My point had struck him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The coachman coughed and explained,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Obviously, the monsters have slow feet. But they know the terrain and have the instincts of natural hunters. They use these advantages to catch up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was like selling drugs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Then you should be vigilant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cough... then I will accept nine gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Okay. The price bargaining had begun.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The basic rule of bargaining was to cut it as much as possible!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“10 silver.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Excuse me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What? Why wasn’t he saying anything?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The response was different than expected.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wasn’t it normal to say, ‘10 gold is too cheap. I will accept eight gold?’ Then I would return with 20 silver, the coachman would offer seven gold. Then 30 silver, six gold...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was my grand plan to complete the bargaining at around two gold.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the coachman just ignored me, making the plan become distorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Aren’t you going to bargain?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Who in the world would bargain with a crook like you? This useless bastard! I was kind enough to cut it to nine gold, yet you offered 10 silver? You want me to bargain? Who is going to make a deal with a bastard like you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Isn’t there the saying, ‘ the customers is king?!’ I will sue you and make you unemployed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“If you want to sue me, do it! Do you think the union will take your side? Get lost, you insane bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In Patrian, my bargaining was always successful because my reputation and affinity with the residents were at the maximum. Even if it didn’t work, I just laughed it off. However, this response was entirely new to me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was serious. At this rate, I wouldn’t be able to ride the carriage. Currently, I only had 3 gold and 11 silver.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The difficulty of the Ashur quest was so terrible that I spent a lot of my money on potions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Please... My sick mother is in Winston Village all alone... She will die soon. What a sad son I will be if I can’t watch my mother’s last moments... Please take pity on me and consider the bargain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I looked as miserable as possible and told a heartbreaking story.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But the cold-hearted coachman just snorted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"You are obviously telling a lie. You didn’t even plan to go to Winston Village in the beginning, so who would believe you now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Sheesh, you’re smarter than you look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What! You cheap bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was no chance of this succeeding. I ran away from the coachman who chased me with a red face and visited other carriages.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But despite being as careful as possible, it was impossible to bargain it down to three gold. No matter what heartbreaking stories I used, the limit was 8 gold and 90 silver.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was frustrated by Satisfy’s modern society.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was it necessary to be stuck at level -3 while being isolated in the remote Bairan Village?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I can’t do that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I had a means to obtain the money for the carriage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Just make items!&nbsp;</span><span style="">If I made an item, I could gain some experience. If it had a normal rating, I could sell it to a store.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I opened the skills window and confirmed the ‘Blacksmith Craftsmanship Skill.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Blacksmith Craftsmanship Skill]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lv: Master</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Produce equipment items that you know how to make.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There is a certain probability of creating rare rated items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There is a low probability of creating epic rated items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There is a rare probability of creating unique rated items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Due to the effect of mastering the skill, the attributes of all items are increased by 10%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When rare rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +2.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Reputation throughout the continent will rise by +30.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When epic rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +4.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Reputation throughout the continent will rise by +80.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When unique rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +12.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Reputation throughout the continent will rise by +300.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is absurd...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">According to the rankings, the first place blacksmith only had intermediate level blacksmith skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Despite producing tens of thousands of items by the time he reached level 110, he barely reached the intermediate level. Thus, he said that production skill levels are hard to raise.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, I basically mastered the ‘Blacksmith Craftsmanship Skill’, which was beyond the ‘Advanced Blacksmith Technique’ and ‘Intermediate Blacksmith Technique’.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If the person ranked number one in the blacksmith rankings were aware of my presence, he would probably quit the game.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘When compared to him, I finally realize the greatness of a legendary class.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I then confirmed the other ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lv. 1</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Produce equipment items that you know how to make.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You can create the production methods for a new item with the ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There is a certain probability of producing rare~ epic rated items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There is a rare probability of creating unique rated items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There is a very rare probability of creating legendary rated items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">*All stats of a production item will increase by 10%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When rare rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +2 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +30.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When epic rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +4 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +80.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When unique rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +12 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +300.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When legendary rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +25 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +1,000.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Something special will occur with every five legendary items created.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill’ was only level one. Nevertheless, it was far superior to the mastered ‘Blacksmith Craftsmanship Skill’. I couldn’t help admiring it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was excited and immediately confirmed the ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation Skill]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You can create three equipment item production methods every time the skill level of the ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill’ goes up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Number of items that can be created at present: 3/3</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When items are produced using this skill, the name of the creator is automatically placed on the item.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Create an item? What is the method?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The explanation wasn’t easy to understand. Seeing was believing. I decided to try it out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I used the Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation Skill without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[What item do you want to create?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The most important item was naturally a weapon. A weapon allowed quick hunting and was directly linked to high levels.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Among the weapons, I thought the best one was a greatsword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thick, big, beautiful...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A big sword that could smash the enemy’s armor was a man’s romance!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Up to this point, I never selected a weapon other than a greatsword in games. Then first, let’s make a greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Greatsword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Have you decided?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[What materials would you like to use?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ohu~ that’s right. I was creating a production method, so I needed to use the materials.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wasn’t it natural to use special materials?&nbsp;</span><span style="">I thought of the person asking for party members to go on the ‘Guardian of the Forest’ boss raid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I heard that the guardian of the forest drops the best mineral so far... the name is...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I recalled it and replied,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Blue Orichalcum.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Have you decided?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
