 <p><span style="">Chapter 103</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Mister...?”</p>
 <p><span style="">The Giant Guild members panicked as Grid suddenly pulled out a weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then they started talking to each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">&lt;Why is he so angry? Did we do anything wrong?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">&lt;What’s the big deal? Ah! Is it because we made Ibellin like that? ㅡㅡ; &gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">&lt;What? ㅋㅋHe’s angry because of his colleague? ㅋㅋㅋ Does that make sense? He’s been identified as a newcomer who only joined the Tzedakah Guild for a few days. How could he feel a sense of camaraderie after just a few days? An average person wouldn’t feel like that.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">&lt;Maybe he’s the kind type. Or maybe he had a relationship with Ibellin before joining the Tzedakah Guild.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">&lt;Wow... This is rotten &nbsp;ㅡㅡ Then this will be a headache...&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As the Giant Guild was misunderstanding, another member gave a new opinion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was someone with the ID of Grey Bear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">&lt;Maybe his anger isn’t because of Ibellin. Look. That person isn’t even looking at Ibellin.&gt;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The guild members paid attention to Gray Bear’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">&lt;If it isn’t Ibellin, why is he angry?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">&lt;Do you see the anvil and production related items in front of the furnace? He seems to have been making an item.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">&lt;Aha~! He was! He ruined his work because of us! So he’s upset!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to Grey Bear, the Giant Guild members resolved their question and apologized to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Did we disturb your work? We’re truly sorry. We will compensate you, so please calm down first and put away your weapon. Then we can talk. We came to invite you to the Giant Guild on Chris’ order. How about it? Isn’t it an honor? Are you happy? Have some of your upset feelings gone away?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The number of members in the smithy belonging to the Giant Guild was over 10 people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Giant Guild had visited smithies several times and saw the process of making items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It took 2~3 hours on average. If it took a long time, the blacksmith would sit in front of the fire for 3~4 hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One or two epic items would be produced every month, while everything else was garbage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Would it be a large difference with the unknown craftsman?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was likely to work in the same manner as regular blacksmiths and would make more epic items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The thoughts of the ordinary guild members were lacking. They dismissed Grid’s work.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Now, put away your sword. Isn’t this too shameful just because we disturbed the production of an item? Hahaha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“... Just?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid stopped just before he swung his sword. Then </span><i><span style="">kwaduduk!</span></i><span style=""> The sound of him gritting his teeth was very loud.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Just the production of an item? Have you ever tried making an item? Are you making fun of my class? Have you ever thought about my efforts and perseverance? Huh? You think you can disregard me, just because you’re a member of a cool guild?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kkuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid held Dainsleif with a tight grip.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He looked prepared to do battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ibellin, who was barely able to save his life with the ‘Fighter’s Beliefs’ passive skill, whispered to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Grid, calm down first.</span></i> <i><span style="">There are 12 people!</span></i> <i><span style="">Grid will be hurt if you fight alone!</span></i> <i><span style="">Please buy time until I recover!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Ibellin also participated in the Malacus raid, so he knew that Grid was strong. At that time, Grid had the unique opportunity to show off his strength.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there were 12 strong opponents. The enemies’ levels were estimated to be over 150, but Grid was only level 97.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had no chance of winning a 12 against 1 fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ibellin wanted Grid to calm down. But it was just wishful thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“These jerks... I don’t like your tone even when you are apologizing. I will kill you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grey Bear clicked his tongue.&nbsp;</span><span style="">'Really dumb. The silly words of these idiots stimulated the craftsman.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They had to persuade or kidnap Grid while the main force of the Tzedakah Guild was being held up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the command given to them. But the problem was the leader of this group had died two times because of Ibellin and was forcefully logged out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There isn’t a leader to talk to him so the situation ended up like this... But it doesn’t matter.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The opponent was a blacksmith. The bizarre looking helmet and the greatsword seemed threatening at first, but it didn’t make sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'A blacksmith can’t wield a greatsword... It won’t be a threat even if he swings it. What can he do even if he’s angry? If conversation doesn’t work, we’ll just kidnap him by force.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grey Bear and the Giant Guild were willing to overpower to Grid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Grid took one step forward.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwajajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The smiles disappeared from the faces of the Giant Guild’s members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was because the greatsword quickly cut down a fellow colleague.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A single blow. He didn’t use any special skills, just swung the sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the health of their colleague fell to less than half in one blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No way!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The class of the attacked member was an assassin. By default, an assassin had weak defense and low health.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If a damage dealer struck, the assassin would lose half their health in one blow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But wasn’t the opponent just a blacksmith?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Blacksmiths weren’t a damage dealer. It was a production-related class. Their attack power should be weak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Grid’s attack power was abnormally strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is with this blacksmith?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘An assassin is fast. But he was hit by the attack without being able to escape. From a blacksmith?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘In the first place, how can a blacksmith handle a greatsword?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The greatsword was a weapon that only high strength warriors could handle.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This greatsword also seemed bigger and heavier than usual ones. How could Grid, who was a blacksmith, handle the greatsword so perfectly?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Damn! What is this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As the Giant Guild fell into confusion, Grid attacked the assassin who had suffered great damage and fell into a stunned state.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your party member Kido has died.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Their colleague died from only two hits.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Giant Guild was astounded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ibellin was also surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘Strong!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">During the Malacus raid, Grid hadn’t shown any special combat skills. He just dealt the final blow to Malacus.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Ibellin thought that Grid just had high stats and some combat techniques because of his hidden class, while his main role was a blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But that was a big miscalculation. Grid was wielding the sword proficiently, like he had experienced numerous battles.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ibellin’s vision was correct.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had played as a greatsword wielding warrior for a year.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He hunted in the same hunting ground with low level monsters every day. Therefore, his level up was slow, but he built up a solid base.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That base blossomed after Grid became Pagma's Descendant and got the high stats.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dainsleif played the role of wings.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Dainsleif... Great!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid marvelled at the power of Dainsleif.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Dainsleif (Reproduction)]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 500/500 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 451~635(+165)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Attack Speed: -8%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Additional damage equal to 10% of the target’s current defense will be dealt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The greater the number of enemies, the greater the damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The skill ‘Golden Flash’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I knew it was a weapon specializing in dealing with a large number of enemies, but this much damage...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After killing Kido, the remaining 11 members of the Giant Guild recognized Grid as an enemy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dainsleif also got an additional 165 attack power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">+15 attack power was added per enemy, so he could gain +1,500 attack power if he faced 100 enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had to take into consideration that Dainsleif had a maximum attack power of 635 and was currently one of the strongest weapons. The additional attack power value was high enough to destroy the balance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Considering the balance... Is there a cap on the additional damage? Anyway, it’s true that this is amazing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was forced to admire it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Compared to my unique items, the performance of Dainsleif is outstanding. My skills still haven’t reached Albatino.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The creator of Dainsleif was the human blacksmith, Albatino!&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was clearly great. But he failed to acquire the title of ‘legend’ like Pagma.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, Grid was already a legend due to being Pagma's Descendant. Nevertheless, he wasn’t as good as Albatino.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was still too difficult for Grid to claim that he was Pagma's Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I need to put in more effort. First, I will jump over Albatino and then Pagma. But before that...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He needed to get rid of these bastards.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will make you pay for ruining my item! Blacksmith's Rage!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Blacksmith’s Rage has been activated. Your attack power and attack speed will increase significantly for 20 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ohhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s strength was boosted and he swung Dainsleif horizontally. Two Giant Guild members standing next to each other were hit at once.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The guild members used their weapon or shield to defend against the attack, but they were unable to withstand the weight of the greatsword and were pushed back a few steps.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Giant Guild members were convinced the moment they experienced the terrible attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This... No, he isn’t a blacksmith!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grey Bear trembled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“We were tricked! He isn’t the unknown craftsman! These vile Tzedakah people set up a trap!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Let’s get out of here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They determined it was a trap and couldn’t stay any longer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Giant Guild members were worried about the worst and started to retreat. But Grid had no intention of letting them go.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You’re trying to run away?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid opened his inventory. He took out the Ideal Dagger and used Quick Movements.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Quick Movements has been activated. Your agility and evasion rate will increase significantly for 1 minute.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After confirming that his body was lighter, Grid chased after the Giant Guild. He stepped on the shoulders of the spectators and swung Dainsleif downwards as he jumped.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwajajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuaaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One of the Giant Guild members running away screamed and fell down.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He shivered as he felt the power of Dainsleif.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His eyes were astonished. Then notification windows popped up in succession.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have been hit by a blow!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 5,900 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The durability of the Adolph Full Plate Armor has decreased by 80.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The broken pieces of armor penetrated deep into your body. There will be a continuous bleeding effect until the pieces are removed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Cough! This is impossible!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The name of the man shouting was Maksevun.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a rare pure tanker who invested all his points into stamina to increase his defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But thanks to the passive effect of Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Grid gained an addition 20% physical damage and 10% critical chance. Then Blacksmith’s Rage increased his attack power and Dainself had the passive effect of &nbsp;‘additional damage equal to 10% of the target’s current defense will be dealt.’ Therefore, even Maksevun’s defense was useless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Even an ogre’s stamina won’t be able to endure this blow!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They should’ve known the moment they saw the blacksmith hold the greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This man was much stronger than Ibellin, one of the 10 rookies. Grid was clearly the secret weapon that the Tzedakah Guild was hiding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘We were wrong.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘We have to escape!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Giant Guild members didn’t care about the eyes of the spectators. They left the wounded Maksevun and kept running away.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid once again pulled out the Ideal Dagger and used Wind Blast to block their retreat. He immediately chased after them while swapping back to Dainsleif and used Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Wave.</span></p>
