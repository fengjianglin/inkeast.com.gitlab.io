 <p><span style="">Chapter 397</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>

 <p><span style="">'It isn’t a big loss if I think about it calmly.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A typical player gained 10 stat points for each level increase.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But those with second classes like Grid were able to gain two additional stat points.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Six of them were forcibly invested in intelligence, but it wasn’t a negative thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Intelligence increases my maximum mana, so I’ll be able to use more skills and the power of my magic will also increase.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Above all, the important part was for Grid was to increase the efficiency of the Assimilation skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was very difficult to give control of his body to Braham, but there was an irresistible appeal about Assimilation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The charm of it was shining in the ‘Magic List’ right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-Available Magic Spells that can be Learned!-</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Magic Detection (Enhanced) Lv. 1]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A magic detection spell developed by the legendary great magician who has completely overturned the activation formula.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Emits a large amount of mana in all directions, locating all living things in a radius of 10 meters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The higher the magic level, the wider the detection range and the more information that can be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Resource Consumption: 3,000 Mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Casting Time: 6 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 10 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-If you use this spell three times in Great Magician mode, you will learn it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thus, it was possible for Grid to acquire magic used by Braham in Assimilation mode.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It meant he could get the unique magic of a legendary great magician for free.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was a complete scam. It was so crazy that it wouldn’t be strange for others to be blinded by jealousy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I want to learn more of Braham’s magic, so I need to raise my intelligence.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s main duty was as a blacksmith and then a swordsman.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he was blinded by immediate greed and invested a lot of stat points in intelligence, he was likely to shed tears of blood in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A weak hybrid is the worst. Don’t be impatient.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Of course, the way to raise his intelligence wasn't just stat points.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He could wear items that increased his intelligence, such as Malacus’ Cloak and the Black Quartz Earrings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it wasn’t easy to make items that raised stats.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If it was that easy, Grid would’ve made agility items from scratch in order to make his agility and strength ratio 1:1.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will try to challenge it later. First, I need to try my best to finish the Behen Archipelago.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He saved his 6 remaining stat points despite being filled with the sudden desire to raise intelligence.</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">『 There were a total of eight events in the 1st National Competition. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">&lt;The 2nd National Competition’s Special Broadcast&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The director of the broadcast, which expected them to have a lot of interest, pointed &nbsp;to the monitor on the stage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Boss raid, PvP, pet marathon, escape the labyrinth, the target processing match, international siege, and various production events were listed on the monitor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">These were the events in the 1st National Competition</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Unlike the 1st National Competition where there were 17 participating countries, this time there is a total of 32 participating countries. The size and interest are naturally bigger. 』&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The S.A. Group has found that it’s hard to show the best of the players with only eight events, and there is also a limit on the spectacles provided to the viewers. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The number of events has been increased to 13, and many of them are non-combat events. It is more friendly to various classes rather than just the combat classes. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Still, the most popular event in the 2nd National Competition will be the PvP, just like the 1st National Competition. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The S.A. Group said they would be changing the PvP system so that no nasty results like the Grid vs Hurent 3 second incident or Grid vs Bondre 4 second incident will occur again. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The damage of PvP (Player VS Player) will be reduced by 50% compared to the damage of PvE (Player VS Environment: a player’s actions against monsters, dungeons, traps, terrain, etc). 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 In other words, if you use a skill that deals 100% damage to a monster, it will only deal 50% damage to a user. This will make the strategic elements of PvP more advanced, and viewers will be able to watch the spectacular sights for a longer time. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hoh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This means they don’t need to watch out for the destructiveness of people like Grid or Chris.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The importance of control has increased.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The tankers will be the biggest beneficiaries.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The faces of the PvP participants in the National Competition brightened after they confirmed the changes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, the Korean netizens felt resentful.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Ah...</span></i> <i><span style="">One of Grid’s gold medals will fly away.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">To be honest, Grid’s strength is his powerful attacks. This is basically a patch to seal it.</span></i> <i><span style="">It is absurd;;</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">This is a patch completely aimed at Grid.</span></i> <i><span style="">It isn’t fair.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Once upon a time, when Korea was still the gaming powerhouses, there were many patches to balance the power of the Korean players.</span></i> <i><span style="">This reminds me of that time.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">This is what is called a ‘nerf.’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Wow, that’s a classic game term;;; my father used it when he was young;;; how old is it?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Anyway, now that Grid can’t win a gold medal in PvP, Korea will never enter the top 10.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">This is really...</span></i> <i><span style="">The S.A. Group is a complete traitor...</span></i> <i><span style="">Screwing up their own country like this...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">This is the conspiracy of the world governments. It’s only the Koreans who are suffering.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The foreigners named this PvP system the ‘Grid Nerf.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In particular, countries such as China and Japan, who had a big sense of competitiveness with South Korea, were dancing with joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Ah, ah.</span></i> <i><span style="">A small nation like South Korea is being squished by the world.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">China will prove that they are the best country in Asia!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">The best in Asia!</span></i> <i><span style="">China is the center of the world!</span></i> <i><span style="">Hao is participating, so it’s natural that he will win!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Don’t make me laugh.</span></i> <i><span style="">Japan is better than China.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">China’s only strength is their tactics, because each country in the National Competition is limited to 7 participants.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">In the end, Damian, Katz, and Yoshimura are the best in Asia.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Let’s see.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The 50% reduced PvP damage in the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As this patch was shaking the world...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have entered the 56st island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok... Heok... Wow, this. It is really too much. The difficulty rises exponentially every time I pass an island.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The main subject of all the conversations, Grid, was solely devoted to capturing the Behen Archipelago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was he pioneering his own way, regardless of what people said?&nbsp;</span><span style="">That wasn’t it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Recently, Grid only had time to play the game, sleep, and eat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was unaware of what was going around the world.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Did he check the TV or Internet?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No. Every moment of the day was too precious for Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The difficulty of the Behen Archipelago was so high that he had to focus his whole mind on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In other words, Grid didn’t know that he was nerfed in the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thus, the world started to misunderstand him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Grid is silent.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yes.</span></i> <i><span style="">He didn’t complain to the S.A. Group despite being nerfed. ㄷㄷ</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">If this had happened to other rankers, they would be accusing the S.A. Group in various interviews around the world;;</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It’s common sense to ask for compensation.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Grid is seriously...</span></i> <i><span style="">A guy like this is cool.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Truly God Grid!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">The old stories on the Internet paint Grid as complete trash, but they must be written by anti-fans.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-Absolutely.</span></i> <i><span style="">Grid is amazing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The spread of things was scary.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Once favourable opinions about Grid started to appear, Koreans as well as people from all over the world started praising Grid’s attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was acknowledged by the racists filled with the ideology of white supremacists, and even some terrible terrorist groups in the Middle East supported Grid. It was an amazing phenomenon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Once it was 22 days away from the National Competition, South Korea had a talk show about Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The guest was Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Why isn’t Grid reacting to this patch? To Grid, this nerf is a minor problem. He is like this. Nerf? Try it. No one can stop me Why? I am God Grid! A healthy person from Korea! Do you know God Grid? Hooray South Korea! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dammit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Things had already become too big by the time Grid heard about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In Grid’s mind, he immediately wanted to call the S.A. Group and say, ‘Why do you have to patch a person? Aren’t games supposed to be fair?’ However, he was too embarrassed to come forward now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was due to Peak Sword’s words on the talk show.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dammit...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had known each other for over a year, but he still wasn’t aware of Grid’s personality?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The power of bias was too terrible.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Unfortunately, this is where I give up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This is also my limit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Everyone seems to be the same.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members challenging the Behen Archipelago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The vast majority of them failed to pass the 31st island and raised the white flag.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The worst trials of the past caused even the famous geniuses to feel despair.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"How did Grid pass?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“How far has Grid developed...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“We’re on the same side, but he’s still scary.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The concept of the 31st island.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The more genius a person was, the greater the difficulty they faced.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel was aware of this fact, but he didn’t want to pour cold water on the Overgeared members praising Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Their respect and affection towards Grid is becoming stronger.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel predicted that on the 31st island, Grid likely faced monsters like ogres.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘In other words, the 31st island is a privilege for bad players.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Except for Grid, it was natural for the Overgeared members to drop out at the 31st island.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How did Yura, Jishuka, and Huroi pass the 31st island?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel found the results incomprehensible.</span></p>
