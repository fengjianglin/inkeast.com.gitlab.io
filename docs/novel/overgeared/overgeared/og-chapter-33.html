 <p><span style="">Chapter 33</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Let’s do the quest.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the very first time Huroi had received a hidden quest since he first started Satisfy almost a year ago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had been playing Satisfy since the day it opened, but he never had such great luck.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'The skill called Unbreakable Justice isn’t known so its effectiveness can’t be determined. However, I’ve heard about the courage state in rumors. Every time the courage stat increases by 10 points, attack power and defense will permanently increase.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If I succeed in this quest and receive the Apostle of Justice title, I can grow using the courage stat. Then I can become a ranker.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi was currently level 127.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Compared to the average level of users, it was very high and he was treated as a high-level user wherever he went.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it wasn’t so high considering that he was an early user.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was only level 127 despite playing 18 out of 24 hours a day for one year because of his class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Huroi’s class wasn’t a combat or production class, it was an ‘orator.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An orator’s weapon was talking!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Combat classes and production classes could raise their levels relatively easy by hunting or making items. However, an orator only competed with words so it had a weak combat ability and couldn’t make any items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reason Huroi managed to reach this level was due to always receiving quests from NPCs through talking.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But that method had now reached its limit. The higher the level, the higher the difficulty of the quest and the less experience that was gained.&nbsp;</span><span style="">While other people were hunting monsters or selling items, he was going back and forth carrying out unprofitable quests.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thus, Huroi desperately needed to gain experience through hunting.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, the weapons that an orator could use were extremely limited. Their health was the lowest of all classes, while their basic combat stats and skills were poor. It was a cycle he couldn’t escape from. It was hard for him to even catch a monster 15 levels lower than him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One of his flagship skills, ‘Spiteful Tongue’, WAS a powerful skill that causes all stats of the target to decline. But it wasn’t easy to use in a life and death fight, as obviously, there were limits to its use.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The fatal weakness of my class is that my combat strength is weak... I can overcome this weakness with the courage stat.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had to succeed in this quest in order to earn the Apostle of Justice title and gain the courage stat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After reaffirming his determination, he arrived at the street in front of the western gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The gate was relatively quiet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because the lord of Winston strictly monitored and managed the residents, so the residents couldn’t leave Winston.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even now, there were no residents of Winston going through the gate, only travelers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Thank you for your hard work.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi approached the soldiers guarding the gate and greeted them before presenting his ID card.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a simple traveler who wasn’t a resident of Winston, he could easily pass through the gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But strangely, the soldiers didn’t let Huroi out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Huroi noticed the danger as the soldiers blocked the gates.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is the Mero Company already aware of my betrayal?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was serious. If he delayed, he would be caught by the Mero Company and fail the quest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the biggest opportunity he received in one year, so he couldn’t miss it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What reason do you have for stopping me? Surely there wasn’t a mistake?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi tried to talk with the soldiers. He intended to persuade or deceive the soldiers by using his weapon, his eloquence.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the soldiers kept their mouths shut and didn’t speak a single word to Huroi. They blatantly avoided conversing with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is ominous.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi decided that he should leave this place at once. At that moment, he heard a familiar voice behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No matter what you say, the soldiers won’t respond. I told the soldiers not to react no matter what you say until they receive a signal from me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi was so surprised it felt like his heart stopped.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was due to the sudden appearance of Rabbit, a top employee of the Mero Company and commissioned Huroi to persuade the Winston inhabitants.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi tried to conceal his confusion and greeted Rabbit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Aren’t you Mr. Rabbit? Shouldn’t you be busy doing business in your office?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I had a headache so I went out for some fresh air.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Haha, relaxation is important. You can’t work efficiently if you are in a bad condition. Rabbit, why did you instruct the soldiers not to talk to me? Are you trying to take away the joy I get from talking to other people? I feel really sad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit grinned at Huroi and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Mr. Huroi, you have an obligation to instigate the residents of Winston, according to your contract with me. It is natural to visit me after fulfilling the contract. But you didn’t do anything and are trying to leave Winston, so I don’t know how to take this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi calmly explained,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“In order for my words to serve as a weapon, there must be a small gap in the minds of the opponent. I have to wait for the right time to incite the people. This isn’t a problem that can be solved by hurrying, as I have to wait until the right time comes. The scenery near Winston is famous, so I wanted to see it while waiting. I am leaving Winston? It is just a misunderstanding.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit made a surprised expression and said,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is that so? I misunderstood your intentions?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As an orator, Huroi had a passive skill called ‘Persuasion’ and the ‘persuasive power’ stat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Both his Persuasion level and persuasive power stat were currently very high, so he could move NPCs according to his will if he used it well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes, it is a misunderstanding. So Rabbit, can you direct the soldiers to let me pass through the gate?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi was sure that he succeeded after seeing Rabbit’s response.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he was mistaken.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rabbit was an NPC with very high intelligence. He had a lot of experience from growing the Mero Company to be one of the best in the north.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It meant that Huroi wasn’t at a level to manipulate him yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit made a sorry expression.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I thought that Mr. Huroi’s eloquence was very good. So I believed that you could easily incite the residents. But now you look incompetent. I admit that I misunderstood your abilities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“... Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This morning, the Mero Company distributed flyers across the village as scheduled. There will be a big gap in the minds of the residents who read the flyers. They will be wavering and confused. Now is the right time for you to enter and dazzle them with your words, making their hearts lean towards the Mero Company. But you lack the ability to read this mood. Otherwise... you must’ve betrayed me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit’s eyes were like a hawk’s.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The sharp gaze penetrated Huroi and provided enormous pressure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi realized it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Rabbit, did you predict my betrayal in advance? You expected me to try to escape by misleading the soldiers, so you gave the soldiers instructions not to talk to me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I have met and managed many people. So I never believed in anyone from the beginning. Rather than anticipating your betrayal, I just made assumptions that you might betray me and prepared for the worst. Now, come over here. You will be locked up for a while. Instead of persuading the residents, you have joined them. Therefore, I can’t let you go and meet Earl Steim.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit gestured and the soldiers ran towards Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is the end. I can’t escape from this place with my battle skills. I will clearly be trapped and fail the quest. No... I can’t give up!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He might never have another chance at a hidden quest. It was an opportunity that must never be missed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Forget about acting rashly. Let’s log out and get rid of the immediate crisis. I need to think carefully about how to handle this crisis.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi made a swift judgment and tried to log out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the case of a quest in a specific place, it was impossible to log out during the quest. However, this was the center of a village. There were users curiously watching the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was a public place so Huroi believed he could log out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Logout!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You can’t shut down the game here.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi was astonished.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was due to an unexpected notification window.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Stop your futile resistance!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After failing to log out, Huroi was captured and tied up by the soldiers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit said cynically,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Logout. It is a mysterious spell that takes your immortal bodies to an unknown place Don’t you know that we have the power to neutralize it?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">NPCs were clearly aware of the difference between users and themselves. So Rabbit intended to keep Huroi alive. Huroi would resurrect somewhere else if he was killed, so it was better to imprison him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit directed the soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Lock him in the castle’s dungeon. Tell the lord that he should be watched closely for a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“T-This...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The first quest he received in a year, only for him to fail!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Huroi was in hell.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As he felt despair, a notification window flashed before him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The quest ‘For the Residents of Winston (A)’ has changed to ‘Wait (S)’.] </span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Wait]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Difficulty: S</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Having played into the hands of Rabbit, you have failed the commission to report the Winston lord and Mero Company’s evil deeds to Earl Steim.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Fortunately, hope still remains.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Winston Castle’s dungeon is known to be impossible to escape from!&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the dark, cold and unsanitary dungeon, you must somehow survive until the end. If you can endure the cold and hunger, the Apostle of Justice will surely come and rescue you</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Conditions: Don’t log out for 50 hours in real time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* This is an extremely dangerous quest. For the elderly and those with a weak health, please give up on this quest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Would you like to accept the quest?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What type of quest is this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The unfamiliar information window that popped up caused Huroi to feel confused and tense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can’t log out for 50 hours in real time, not Satisfy’s time? What is this absurd condition?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi was confident of his physical strength in reality. Thanks to that, he could play Satisfy for 20 hours in the capsule.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the limit was 20 hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was because the capsule’s safety system didn’t allow access for more than 20 hours. After connecting to Satisfy for 20 hours, the users would be forced to log out and they couldn’t connect again for six hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In other words, the S.A Group that manufactured and distributed Satisfy’s capsules strongly warned of the danger of connecting to Satisfy for more than 20 hours.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yet there was a quest to stay connected for 50 hours? It was also one where he was stuck in a dungeon, waiting.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘50 hours in reality is equal to 8 days and 8 hours in Satisfy. Will my spirit be able to endure staying in prison for that whole time without doing anything?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This really was a dangerous quest. It was a quest where he might go crazy without being mentally prepared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was also an opportunity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This was an A-grade hidden quest. It is upgraded to an S-grade quest. This is an opportunity that I absolutely can’t miss.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi decided to accept the quest. But before that, he decided to think about it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Did he have any unavoidable schedule in reality? No. He had no schedules recently.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Did he have any family who would be concerned and forcefully shut down the capsule? No. He was single right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was the front door locked? He had stayed home for four days without going anywhere. In the meantime, his front door had been firmly locked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">When was the last time he went to the toilet and ate? Three hours ago. In any case, if he converted the capsule to the sleep state, his body would be able to endure for three days without eating or drinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Did he have a history of problems when connecting to the capsule for a long time? No. His health was second to none.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Okay, my body is at its peak physical health. I shall challenge it once. The S.A Group made this quest, so they won’t let the user die.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi made a firm decision to accept the quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I won’t give up the quest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[This is the last warning. Are you really sure you want to proceed with the quest?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The quest has been accepted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Wait]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Difficulty: S</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Having played into the hands of Rabbit, you have failed the commission to report the Winston lord and Mero Company’s evil deeds to Earl Steim.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Fortunately, hope still remains.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Winston Castle’s dungeon is known to be impossible to escape from!&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the dark, cold and unsanitary dungeon, you must somehow survive until the end. If you can endure the cold and hunger, the Apostle of Justice will surely come and rescue you.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Conditions: Don’t log out for 50 hours in real time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* This is an extremely dangerous quest. For the elderly and those with a weak health, please give up on this quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* From the moment you accept the quest, the system will thoroughly manage and supervise your brain waves and health status in real time. If a critical level of anomalies is detected, the system will force you to log out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* If you are forcibly logged out, the S.A. Group will send executives and medical staff to your home to prepare for the worst.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Even if you complete the quest and log out successfully, the S.A. Group will send executives and medical staff to visit you and check your status.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* You need to endure 200 hours of Satisfy time to complete the quest. In the worst case, because you are connected to virtual reality for a long time, you can confuse reality with virtual reality. Please don’t let go of your tension until the last moment and show a strong mentality.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Reward: A second class called ‘Apostle of Justice’s Partner.’ Title ‘One who Overcomes Hardships.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">*Apostle of Justice’s Partner: The ‘Courage’ stat will be opened. If you are with the Apostle of Justice, all stats will increase by 20%. The skill ‘Unbreakable Justice’ will be generated. The skill ‘Sacrifice for Justice’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* One who Overcomes Hardships: The ‘Indomitable’ stat will be opened. The skill ‘Strong Will’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Failure: There is no penalty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[From now on, the capsule will switch to sleep mode.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[It is impossible to shut off the power of the capsule from the outside.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[If there are any external shocks or attempts to shut off the capsule, an employee of S.A. will be sent to your residence to protect the capsule.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[We applaud your challenge. Good luck.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It feels like I’m a VIP customer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That was the impression Huroi got after checking the emerging information windows.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Don't worry anymore. My spirit can endure for 200 hours.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi’s remaining worries were completely dispelled because he trusted the thorough management and supervision of the S.A. Group. He firmed up his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I’ll be waiting. Apostle of Justice. If he saves me and helps me clear the quest, I will be loyal to him, even if he is an NPC.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi pledged to meet with the unknown Apostle of Justice as he was imprisoned in Winston Castle’s dungeon.</span></p>
