 <p><span style="">Chapter 362</span></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">[Hooded Zip Up]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 57/61 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 10</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Movement speed will increase by 30%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Wind resistance will increase by 20%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A cloak designed by a legendary blacksmith. However, the appearance is different from the normal look of a cloak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to the sylphid scales being used as the material, affinity with wind and movement speed will increase. You can hide while wearing it, but the stealth will be turned off when an enemy is attacked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Conditions of Use: None.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 5</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The biggest advantage was the duration of the Hooded Zip Up. His stealth was maintained just by wearing it. However, it didn’t consume any mana because it wasn’t magical invisibility.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unlike an assassin’s stealth skill, it could be seen through. It had the disadvantage of being ineffective against those with sharp senses.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But this disadvantage didn’t apply on the 20th island.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The hell moon only depended on sight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid rushed forward with his movement buff, and the hell moon wasn’t able to find him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was able to easily break through the 20th island by avoiding the monsters scattered everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Hooded Zip Up was the perfect counter for the 20th island.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have entered the 21st island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Amazing. It’s really amazing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid felt thrilled during the process of breaking through the 20th island.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was he admiring his own ability?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was admiring Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kraugel might be a sword saint candidate, but in the end, he only had a normal class.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He didn’t have access to all types of items like Grid, so how did he reach the 30th island?&nbsp;</span><span style="">His skills were truly phenomenal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He isn’t only strong in battle and hunting. Kraugel is an overwhelming monster in all respects.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As he imagined the process that Kraugel used to pass the 20th island, Grid realized the weight of the of his nicknames.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Challenger?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bini called out to the blank Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid quickly recovered and looked around.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The foggy 21st island stretched out before him. He couldn’t see ahead of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can’t even see my hands.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was impossible to identify anything in front of him thanks to the thick fog. There was a sense of anxiety at not being able to see.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bini laughed at the anxious Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You are lucky to win the Fog Island. You can pass the 21st island for free.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Fog Island?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It is an island with a store.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A store...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid thought about the challenger points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Are you talking about the Challenger Store?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, it is a store where you can buy goods with challenger points.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Store... In other words, the emergence of Fog Island is random?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right. One extremely lucky person met the Fog Island on the 10th island. One unlucky person didn’t see it despite reaching the 30th island."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘That unlucky person is Kraugel.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Oh my god, there was a person who actually had worse luck that Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid felt sympathy as he asked Bini.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“So, do you know where the store is located? I can’t see in front of me because of the fog.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It is anywhere you go. The store will naturally be waiting for you. It’s better to think in advance about what you will buy from the store. The store is only open for five minutes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I don’t know what it sells.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hehe, did you forget that I am the helper fairy? I have already figured out most of the goods sold in the store.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This person seemed quite helpful.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid admired it as Bini put on his glasses again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There are four types of products sold at the store on Fog Island. There are teleportation scrolls to the East Continent, elixirs, various class change books, and skill books. The class change books range from normal to rare rated, while the skill books range from normal to unique rated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s eyes widened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The items sold in the store were really great. They were rare things that couldn’t be bought with money.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Among them, the item with the lowest value of the East Continent portal scroll. Maybe it’s sold because most of the challengers come here to find a way to move to the East Continent? But you can get it for free when you meet Sticks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kraugel... The person who reached the 30th island got the scroll from Sticks?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right. But luckily for them, six challengers met the store before the 10th island and purchased the portal scroll. They didn’t even try to challenge the later islands. Cowards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It isn’t cowardly, but wise. There are seven users who have moved to the East Continent so far.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid thought about it as he moved through the fog and encountered a carriage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a pumpkin shaped carriage that emitted a gentle and calm light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That is the Challenger Store.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid received Bini’s guidance and approached the carriage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Various goods were on display in the carriage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Isn’t there a store owner?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No. It’s an unattended store.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If there was an owner, he would’ve been able to ask questions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid started to scan the products.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[East Continent Movement Portal Scroll]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You can go to the starting village of ‘Pangea’ on the East Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 0.1</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Price: 50 Challenger Points</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Elixir]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A medicine that increases a certain stat by 10 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 10</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Price: 250 Challenger Points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘An elixir is so cheap!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After clearing 20 islands, Grid had exactly 901 challenger points.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It meant he could buy three elixirs that were worth millions of gold.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He thought of the elixirs as cheap, but the reality was quite different.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The people fortunate enough to find the pumpkin carriage on the 10th island had an average of 150 points.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In other words, from a general point of view, the elixirs weren’t cheap at all.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t a kindness to the other challengers of Behen Archipelago, except for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid took a look at the other goods.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Lightning Swordsman Class Change Book]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Rare</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You can change into a lightning swordsman.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 100</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Price: 1,000 Challenger Points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Explosion Sorcerer Class Change Book]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Rare</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You can change into a explosion sorcerer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 100</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Price: 1,000 Challenger Points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hrmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rare rated hidden classes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A year ago, they would’ve sold for billions of won.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now the value of a rare class had been greatly reduced.&nbsp;</span><span style="">People learned that there was a very small gap between 3rd advancement classes and rare rated classes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rare classes didn’t go for a lot of money anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Bini said that the classes only go up to rare rated.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was disappointed after checking the list of class change books, then looked at the skill books.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Dash to Turn the Tables]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Rare</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dashes to the target and deals damage proportional to the target’s defense. They will be in a rigid state for 0.3 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Conditions of Use: None.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Price: 400 Challenger Points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Blazing Short Rain]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Causing a rain of fire for three seconds in the specified area. The damage dealt to the enemy is proportional to the caster’s magic power and physical attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Conditions of Use: None.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Price: 900 Challenger Points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Pass.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Most players coveted rare and epic rated skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid had legendary skills and wasn’t interested. For Grid, they were just a waste of points.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, unique rated skills were different.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">19th knight, Fulito.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Like the skill book ‘Aura Festival’ that he dropped, all of his unique skills had an outstanding performance. Grid also desired them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Aura Festival is rotting in my warehouse.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Aura Festival was a lesser version of Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Transcended Link. Grid kept it in storage because there was no reason for him to learn it. He waited for an opportunity to sell it at a high price.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s eyes widened as he closely looked at the skills list.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The skill he was looking at wasn’t a hidden skill that had a rare, epic, or unique rating.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a normal rated skill that attracted Grid’s attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Weapons Mastery]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Normal</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Type: Passive</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Weapons Mastery skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Price: 6,000 Challenger Points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Weapons Mastery!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weapons Mastery.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a skill that increase attack power and accuracy rate regardless of what type of weapon was used.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Only a small number of combat specialized classes could obtain it, and it could be called the strongest weapon unique to a few classes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, this crazy store was selling the strongest weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I want it!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was filled with extreme greed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was natural.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had the strongest passive skill that allowed him to use all weapons, so this was a ridiculous skill suited for him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His limitation was that he didn’t have any mastery type skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now he could overcome that limitation. It was natural that his greed was boiling.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The problem was the price.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why is a normal skill so expensive?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Originally, passive skills are expensive. Among them, the Weapons Mastery skill is the most expensive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The store would close soon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid checked the time limit and was irritated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If you miss this store now, does it mean I can’t use it again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No. As I said earlier, Fog Island randomly emerges. It might appear again in the future. But it isn’t certain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Then I will wait for next time.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had to clear all the items to get Weapons Mastery. The East Continent Portal Scroll was something he could get in the process of meeting Sticks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid decided to leave the store.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bini’s eyes glowed like lanterns as he looked at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I was afraid that you would buy the portal scroll and leave, but you truly are the challenger who broke through to the 20th island.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It’s a waste to buy something when I can get it for free.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Would he be able to collect 6,000 challenger points?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Even if I fail this time...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He would get stronger and challenge it again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was sucked into the gate.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have entered the 22nd island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Come quickly."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was burning with enthusiasm.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As soon as he entered the new island, he looked around the structure of the island as usual while waiting for Bini to explain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bini explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Up to the 25th island, it’s a fight against time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then a mission was created to prove these words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[22nd Island]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Wipe out the monsters!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">First Clear Reward: 162 Challenger Points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay, I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t delay.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He immediately summoned the God Hands, Noe, and Randy and went to wipe out the island’s monsters.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Experience, skill proficiency, and challenger points piled up, causing Grid’s will to burn.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Four days later.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid killed thousands of monsters on the three islands and finally reached the 25th island.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sticks was waiting for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You... You are Pagma's Descendant... Even... Hell’s strongest... Demonic beast... If it’s you... Contaminated Hall of Fame... Arrived... Ugh! Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sticks fell over while talking.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was nervous when he saw Sticks barely breathing in a scruffy robe.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Something is strange.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid knew how unlucky he was.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The cruel reality spread out in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A quest has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Save Sticks!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">★ Hidden Quest ★</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sticks’ illness has worsened after watching your surprising performance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Fortunately, it can still be treated with medicine.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After learning the method to prepare the medicine from Sticks, take care of him!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Acceptance Reward: ‘Recipe: Elf’s Miraculous Medicine’ will be acquired.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Reward: Affinity with Sticks will rise to the maximum.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Failure: Sticks’ Death.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Would you like to accept the quest?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...No, why will he die if it can still be treated with medicine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He wasn’t convinced, but it was a hidden quest. The reward seemed special and Sticks couldn’t die.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid thought as positively as possible and helped Sticks.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Sururuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Sticks’ face was exposed as the hood fell off.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a surprisingly young man covered in sweat. He was a beautiful man with pointed ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Elf...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had played Satisfy for nearly two years, but it was the first time he saw an elf.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was curious, but dissatisfaction filled Grid’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Normally, shouldn’t it be a female elf?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The first elf he met was a male?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had to nurse a man alone on an island with no one else!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Once again, reality was relentless, unlike the movies and manhwa.</span></p>
