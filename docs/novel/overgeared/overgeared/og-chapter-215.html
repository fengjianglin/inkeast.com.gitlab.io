 <p><span style="">Chapter 215</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Reidan was a three or four days’ walk away from Patrian.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid’s party encountered monsters all the time. They didn’t avoid it, so their journey was delayed several times.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The experience is really good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It had been six days since leaving Patrian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Meanwhile, Grid hunted the strongest monsters in the west and reached level 273. In addition, his experience gauge was at 60%. It was a stunning level-up speed that users couldn’t dream of matching, simply due to the fact that he leveled up every two days.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t know this, but even Kraugel wasn’t able to level up as quickly as Grid currently was when he was level 270.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will be level 275 by the time I reach Reidan,’ Grid excitedly thought to himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even the top rankers would find it hard to hunt these western monsters, so he was proud of his items and his skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This game is truly about items. Control? That was something that only losers who didn’t have good items worried about. Puhahat!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the first place, control was a means used by the weak to try and win against the strong. He didn’t need control if he had overwhelming power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had such a narrow mindset ever since his success in the Malacus raid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had no doubts that items were the best.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But that firm belief of Grid’s was about to be shaken.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pant pant... Wow, this is really dirty. The giant worms before were just exercise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was exhausted as he walked through the vast desert towards Reidan. Thanks to his passive resistance, he didn’t get heat stroke. However, the heat was enough to make his stamina fall faster than usual. Moreover, he couldn’t adapt to the desert terrain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, the monsters kept becoming stronger and stronger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Four basilisks, monsters that were treated as boss-grade monsters in the north, appeared before Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid succeeded in unleashing all sorts of skills against the basilisks, but he was pincer attacked by the monsters and faced a crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ah, really! Let me take a break!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was at his wit’s end. His control was immature so he constantly allowed the monsters to attack him, so even the best armor couldn’t endure and he lost health. In the situation, it wouldn’t be strange if his invincible passive was activated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Even Braham’s golem army wouldn’t be able to exert much power against the monsters here.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The western monsters were strong and numerous. It was the reason why the kingdom chose to let the giant worms spread instead of subjugating them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is impossible for the kingdom to manage the west properly. So the king sent me here.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a correct guess.&nbsp;</span><span style="">King Wiesbaden wished for Grid to cleanse the west that had become barren because of the mighty monsters, giving him Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It showed absolute confidence in Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid thought he was used by the king and couldn’t help cursing.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kiyaaaaak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">As Grid cursed the king, a massive desert toad stretched out its tongue, its sticky mucus flopping out from its mouth and covering Grid’s body.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">This mucus was a type of poison that paralyzed the target in an instant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid resisted and fought back.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The +9 Failure passed through the toad’s fat belly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the western monsters were so weak to die from one of Grid’s blows. The toad moved its tongue like a whip for a counterattack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Damn!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s reaction was too late as he was buried deep in the toad’s stomach. </span><i><span style="">Ku tang tang tang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was stronger than steel and full of resilience, but he was struck in the head and fell. Other monsters swarmed to his fallen body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuak...! Transcend and Transcended Link’s cooldown time isn’t over!”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid tended to depend on skills as he lacked control, but there was a fatal weakness. If the skills weren’t available due to the cooldown time, he couldn’t help being weak.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Piaro! Help me... Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the end, Grid tried to rely on Piaro. However, he was surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because Bland started moving.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid hadn’t been paying any attention during the last six days, but Bland had become extremely strong during that short period.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'What is this all of a sudden?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the person who struggled against the level 280 horned goblins only six days ago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now he was fighting one-on-one with the western monsters that were at least 50 levels higher than him, so he had truly developed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Surely, it isn’t a bug...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was the secret behind this sudden growth?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid questioned as he moved to the rear after Bland pulled aggro. Then he equipped the Great Lord's Sword and examined Bland.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Name: Bland</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Age: 25 &nbsp;Gender: Male</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Occupation: Magic Swordsman</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Title: Great Magician’s Son</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He has inherited the magical talents of his father, Earl Ashur. Receive a bonus to his magic casting speed and mana regeneration speed. Every time his level increased, his intelligence will increase significantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Title: Marquis Steim’s Disciple</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He once learned swordsmanship from Marquis Steim, a swordsman of the north. When a blade type weapon is equipped, attack power will increase by 20% and attack speed by 10%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level: 255</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Strength: 1,331/1,990 &nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 420/1,030</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Agility: 519/1,401 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligence: 2,540/4,550</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Charm: 212/800&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skills: Northern Swordsmanship (B), Spell Casting Acceleration (S), Magic Power Concentration (S), 9 C-grade Spells, 5 B-grade spells, 2 A-grade spells.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Click on the details to examine the spells that the target has currently acquired.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bland.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In his childhood and adolescence, he studied magic under his father and swordsmanship under Marquis Steim.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He followed the typical elite course, and was a young genius considered to be the cornerstone of the Eternal Kingdom in the future.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There is nothing special?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had observed Bland’s details shortly after obtaining him as a hostage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The difference between then and now was only five levels, and a small rise in stats.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Then why did he become so much stronger?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was curious.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's it. You understood correctly. You shouldn’t play around when holding a sword in your hand. Rather than avoiding the enemy’s attacks, it is better to aim for defense or a counterattack. Even if your opponent is stronger than you, they will be easier to defeat if you keep moving your sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro was talking to Bland.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Grid realized.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is thanks to Piaro’s teachings!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He might be a great swordsman, but was it possible for a person to grow so quickly just from his advice?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid started to observe Piaro and Bland.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unlike before, he didn’t go ahead alone and hunted monsters near them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You are too tied up with being a magic swordsman. Magic casting and swordsmanship can’t be done at the same time, so a gap will occur. However, this doesn’t mean you should throw away magic. You have more talent in magic than in the sword, so if you are facing a stronger enemy, you should concentrate on your magic. Your swordsmanship is ideal for minimal defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro would give advice and Bland would apply the teachings in real time whenever a monster appeared. Bland’s rapid growth had a big impact on Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Learning how to fight properly. In other words, the power of control was more than he thought possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘...If I combine control with items, how much stronger can I become?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid finally became aware of it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was able to understand that he would reach his limits in the future if he just relied on his items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, he asked Piaro,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Please teach me as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Didn’t you say that there was no need before?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Originally, a person’s mind is flexible. Now I want to learn from you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is he because he can no longer sit back and watch Bland grow alone? Did he lose his confidence as Pagma's Descendant?'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro was able to understand that Grid was an unprincipled person. He was the type of person that Piaro disliked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Piaro readily accepted Grid’s request.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was in the hope that he could enhance his strength by raising Grid’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s frozen mind that was obsessed with revenge was slowly reviving as he met Grid and Bland. It was a small but significant change.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After that.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Don’t move your head. How many times do I have to tell you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Isn’t it natural to shake my head every time I move? How can I control my body?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Try to make an effort. Think while you are fighting. And don’t rely on Fly. Warriors must become accustomed to various terrains, so fighting in the desert will be a valuable experience for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"How can I wield my sword when my feet are buried in the sand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Put your weight on the tip of your sword, not your feet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"So how do I do that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"... How many times do I need to explain that you have to move your muscles well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No, how do I move my muscles?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reason why Bland could grow rapidly was that he was a genius.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The best teacher and best disciple met, so the synergy exploded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid was a stupid person. It wasn’t easy for even a great swordsman to teach him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro suffered as he taught Grid, who lacked comprehension and was slow to learn. He started to feel pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I thought he was a smart person, but that isn’t it...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How could such a stupid person have gained Pagma’s power and inheritance?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro wondered. He honestly wanted to give up on teaching Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he couldn’t take back his words so he kept teaching Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid grumbled that it was difficult and complex, but he did his best to follow the teachings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid repeated this in the three days before arrived at Reidan and finally improved.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“He is a little bit ordinary now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was able to build up the basic skills of a swordsman.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the limit of his capabilities and of a great swordsman’s teaching ability.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I don’t think it is possible for Grid to grow beyond this.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro was overwhelmed with a sense of defeat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Grid’s party arrived at Reidan.</span></p>
