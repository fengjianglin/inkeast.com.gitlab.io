 <p><span style="">Chapter 57</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">During the time I worked at the labor office, I played Satisfy for an average of five to six hours a day.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But that changed after I changed to the capsule room.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">My play time increased by around 10 hours, and now I was connected to Satisfy more than 15 hours a day on average.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to that, I could produce double the number of items a day.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath has increased the effectiveness of your production items.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lv. 2</span></p>
 <p><span style="">When you are concentrating on making an item, the will of Pagma’s Descendant will fill the production item.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">All stats of a production item will increase by 7%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There is a rare chance of giving special features to your production items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Please give me legendary this time...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Currently, I was producing a plate armor with a level limit of 120, based on a newly acquired production method.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The value of the materials used was a huge 483 gold! This was one fifth of all my assets. It was the most expensive item I’d made so far.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I invested a lot of money, but was worried it would turn out to be a normal item, so I spent 20 hours making it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Yes, I’m honestly not hoping for a legendary rated item. But at least give me unique. Please...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was a legendary blacksmith, so I needed some hope!&nbsp;</span><span style="">I fervently joined together the last sheet of iron.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the armor was completed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Very Delicate Plate Armor]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 272/272 &nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 303 Movement Speed: -6%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* There is a small chance of completely defending against stab attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An armour made by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but lacks experience and reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">By applying thinly refined steel plates in two layers, defense and movement has increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 120 or higher. More than 380 strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">More than 400 stamina. Intermediate Heavy Armor Mastery.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[An epic rated item was produced, so all stats have permanently risen by +4 and reputation throughout the continent has risen by +80.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dammit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an epic item.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was glad that it wasn’t a normal or rare item, but it wasn’t satisfying, considering the amount of time and effort I invested.&nbsp;</span><span style="">With thinking about the raw materials value and the capsule fee, there wasn’t much profit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan didn’t know my thoughts and praised me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Did you really make this armor using the method I gave you? Why did it turn out so differently despite using the same method? You’re truly amazing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Phew... how much can I get for this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I asked without expecting much.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Khan said something incredible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Hrmm... honestly, it is hard to measure the exact price. But one thing is clear. You can get a higher price auctioning this to the knights rather than selling it at the smithy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Auction it off to the knights?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The fact that NPC knights were buying items at an auction was amazing. But I was surprised at the idea of selling level 120 armor to at least level 180 knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A month ago, I witnessed and admired the knights’ armor at the procession for the newly appointed lady. I could see that there is a great blacksmith at Frontier. But now that I’ve seen your work, it is much better than the work from Frontier’s blacksmith. Haha, it’s only natural, since you’re Pagma’s Descendant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Oh...my armor’s performance was good enough to appeal to level 180+ knights?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Indeed, I had the Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill and the Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They raised the item stats by 12% and 7% respectively. It might be an epic rating, but the performance of this Very Delicate Plate Armor was equivalent to a level 180 normal or rare armor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There is an added option thanks to the breath skill.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I asked about the most important part.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“If my item is bought at the auction, what’s the fee I’ll have to pay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The proceeds for the knights’ auction is from the castle. It is organized in the name of the lady. Nobles have high pride, so they aren’t aiming for personal gain. There is no fee at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I immediately decided.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Okay. I will put it up for auction.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Good decision. The auction takes place in two days, so I’ll go at that time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Nope. I’ll go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh? It is okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes. I’ve been stuck inside for a month, so I want to go outside for a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah, yes. Then take this with you. This will prove your identity so you can enter the auction without any extra procedures.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have obtained the token of ‘ Smithy’s Successor.’]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How much could I sell this armor for? If I followed Khan’s words, could I make a lot of money...?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No, don’t expect too much. If my expectations are lower, I won’t be so disappointed.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was someone with no luck. I had experienced disappointment more than once or twice. So I steadied my heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan suggested,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Why don’t you aim at making an armor that is better than this one in the next two days? Wouldn’t it be better to show several works if you’re participating in the auction?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That’s true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">For the next two days, I invested 20 hours a day and made two items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, the result was one normal and one epic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No, how can I make a normal item after spending 20 hours on it? It should at least be a rare item.'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Did this make sense?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No matter how I thought about it, this was due to the S.A. Group.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were worried that my legendary class would destroy the balance, so they gave me the worst probabilities when making items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If not, I might be more unlucky than I knew...</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">There were two reasons why the ruler of a territory would host regular auctions for the knights.&nbsp;</span><span style="">First of all, it was to help the knights obtain the best equipment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The second reason was to use it as an opportunity to find skilled people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why were they trying to find skilled people?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was to make a business deal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The people who created the most outstanding works at the auction had permission to deliver goods to the lord.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an opportunity to open a door in life.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Buzz, buzz.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Winston Castle’s annex lobby.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dozens of people who came to present the items at this auction were gathered with a nervous expression.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were users and NPCs. There were also several blacksmiths.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I looked at blacksmiths and thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If there is an outstanding blacksmith, I want to recruit them for our smithy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I could assign new blacksmiths to do all types of errands and get a commission from selling the items made by the blacksmiths.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Once Khan steps down and I become the owner, I will run the smithy with the intention of recruiting new blacksmiths.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The auctioneer showed up while I was thinking about a type of slave project.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The auction will start in 20 minutes. The auction will last for three hours, and you can stay in the waiting room while it’s ongoing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then a notification window popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have entered the auction hosted by the lady. Please submit the items to be listed and the minimum bid for that item.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I opened my inventory. Then I checked the details of the items appearing in the auction for one last time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Very Delicate Plate Armor]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 272/272 &nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 303 Movement Speed: -6%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* There is a small chance of completely defending against stab attacks.</span></p>

 <p><span style="">Durability: 83/83 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 29 &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Attack Speed: +4% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accuracy: +8%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Gauntlets made by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but lacks experience and reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The exterior doesn’t look like anything special, but it works surprisingly well when worn.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 120 or higher. More than 1,000 agility.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“As planned, these two...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I decided to register these two items at the auction.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Please set a minimum bid price for the Very Delicate Plate Armor.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Please set a minimum bid price for the Seemingly Plain Gauntlets.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Hrmm...what should I set it as?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I normally made level 60 equipment. This was the first time I made level 120 equipment, and I wasn’t sure of its value.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I would like to raise the price as high as possible when considering the cost of materials and labor... but if it is too expensive, there might not be a big...’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As I was in distress, a white-haired boy approached me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Mister~ is there a problem?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hello. I’m called Steng. My class is a blacksmith. I was watching you, and you also seem like a blacksmith. This seems like your first auction, so I thought I would help you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The boy smiled as he said his name.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was something familiar about the name.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Who is Steng...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a name I knew clearly, but I couldn’t remember why I knew it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I didn’t know if I couldn’t remember because my memory was bad or because it wasn’t important.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I explained to Steng.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I’m worried because I can’t decide on the bid price of the items to be auctioned.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Steng blinked with surprise.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Your teacher didn’t set a bid price?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Teacher?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The teacher who gave you this quest. Aren’t you showing your teacher’s items at this auction?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was he talking about?&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was puzzled as Steng pulled out a one-handed sword in a brilliant sheath.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is the special weapon that my teacher created for this auction. Isn’t it amazing? It’s a rare item with a level limit of 190.”</span></p>
