 <p><span style="">Chapter 203</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style=""> "Overgeared! Let’s show the world the emergence of the Overgeared Guild and elevate our lord!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your morale has increased.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your attack power and magic attack power will significantly rise for the next attack.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The next attack will be a critical hit!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The strongest buff skill of the 1st ranked orator, Morale Boost was applied to all guild members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Tzedakah Guild members murmured about the overwhelming effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow, the effect is really great.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It’s a buff that makes a deadly strike possible...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka spoke to rile up Toban.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Shouldn’t the 1st ranked paladin prove that he isn’t lacking in comparison?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Compared to the other guild members, his level was relatively low, but Toban was now level 280. He was at least 10 levels higher than Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He used a buff skill that could be called the ultimate skill of the second advancement paladin.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“God Judar’s Blessing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[All stats will increase by 20% for 5 minutes.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your health and defense will increase by 30% for 10 minutes.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel finally recovered from his shock of Grid calling the guild Overgeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is the best skill of the first ranked Judar paladin that I’ve only heard about!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a great buff that was completely different from Huroi’s buff.&nbsp;</span><span style="">All members of the Tzedakah Guild were truly monsters.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel was feeling admiration while Jishuka loaded a Super-special Jaffa Arrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Then shall we begin?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid made the unique rated ‘Salamander’s Horn’ for her, and it could be called the most powerful bow currently in existence. The disadvantage was its slow firing speed, but the attack power was ruthlessly high. It also increased the attack power of the fire attribute, so the compatibility with Jishuka was very good.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Firecrackers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The woman called an expert archer, her bow skills had reached the realm of a god.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the moment when the 1st ranked archer entered the battle.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Syuok!</span></i> <i><span style="">Syu syu syu syu syuk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The only drawback of the Salamander’s Horn was its slow speed, and this was overcome with her rapid-fire speed skills, as she shot seven arrows with barely any time lapses between them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The arrows were aimed at the ancient weapon 2,300m ahead of her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was amazing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The arrows flying alone exploded. Then like a firecracker, flames appeared at the end and added acceleration.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuoooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The ancient weapon felt danger. In order to counter the arrows, it opened its mouth and tried to launch the magic energy. Instead white magic power started to gather around the mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Jishuka’s arrows didn’t give it time to charge its magic power. It struck the ancient weapon and caused another explosion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kurururung.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The massive body of the ancient weapon made a strange sound.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then a notification window appeared in front of Jishuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The target’s mana core has been shocked.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The target’s magic power flow has been blocked.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The target can’t use magic for three seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The effect of Firecracker worked properly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Anti-magic Shield of the ancient weapon was temporarily released.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The first ranked mixed magician Laella and the second ranked wind magician Zednos acted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Demon King’s Tail Fire.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Tyrant’s Hammer!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka used her strongest skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Phoenix Arrow!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Everything in a straight line was swallowed up by the flames.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The ancient weapon that Jishuka target was hit by black flames, a giant hammer and a mighty phoenix.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Its eyes turned red as it looked around. It was asking its fellow golems for help.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But there was no one who could help it. The other five ancient weapons were in the same situation as him. All the ancient weapons were being beaten by the Overgeared members who had divided into several groups.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In particular, the ancient weapon being attacked by Regas was suffering the most.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[The 5th combo has been achieved!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The effect of the ‘Lightning Duke’s Knuckles’ has been activated, causing additional physical damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[The 6th combo has been achieved!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The effect of the ‘Lightning Duke’s Knuckles’ has been activated, causing additional lightning damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwang kwang kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[The 8th combo has been achieved!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The effect of the ‘Lightning Duke’s Knuckles’ has been activated, causing additional physical and lightning damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejejeok!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[The 10th combo has been achieved!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The effect of the ‘Lightning Duke’s Knuckles’ has been activated, causing Thunder Chariot to be triggered.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kurururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Was this person descended from the realm of the gods?&nbsp;</span><span style="">A thunderous chariot fell from the sky and forced the ancient weapon on its knees.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then an eagle flew over its head and suddenly transformed into a human.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Beasts of Prey Toon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wore silver wristblades with the G engraved on them and he shouted like a lion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Weaken all nearby enemies.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kukuk! Kuhahat! Now I will slice you up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toon transformed into a werewolf and his greatly improved wristblades flashed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The ancient weapon had its whole body electrocuted so it couldn’t cope and suffered great damage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, the ancient weapon in front of the south wall staggered under the combined attacks of Pon and Vantner.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hap!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjeejeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ura! Ura! Urahh~!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The ancient weapon was unable to endure anymore and swung its arms.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The agile spearman Pon moved away, while Guardian Knight Vantner defended himself with his shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Uh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a terrible damage. Vantner failed to completely absorb the damage and stiffened from the aftermath.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The ancient weapon was about to fire its magic power at him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Vantner realized this and screamed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hey! Help me, Pon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Are you stiffened right now? Just hold it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Instead of helping Vantner, Pon jumped forward using Vantner’s shoulder. Then he aimed a skill towards the ancient weapon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Mach Spear!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an unbeatable attack.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The sonic spear passed through the thick head of the ancient weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Half of the head was broken and the ancient weapon staggered. Pon landed on the ground and cheered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Vantner glared at him angrily,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“You jerk...! How dare you use a companion as a sacrifice? Eh? Did you feel good?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner had turned charcoal after being hit by the magic ray.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was truly angry, but Pon just shrugged.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It's called teamwork."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Shit! What is this teamwork?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner’s face turned red.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He seemed like a boiled octopus, causing Pon to laugh.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, Vantner couldn’t bear it and swung his axe at Pon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Today I will kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Try it if you can, bald bastard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The ancient weapon thought it was ridiculous. Fighting each other in front of it? This was an opportunity.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It swung its arms at the fighting Pon and Vantner.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Pon once again easily avoided the attack, while Vantner defended with his shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The same pattern was repeated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The ancient weapon had only one choice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It ignored the fast Pon and tried to launch a magic ray towards the rigid Vantner.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Vantner once again contemplated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hey Pon! This time you should really help me! I will die this time! Yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Use your Invincible skill~”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner had been putting points in stamina since the Malacus raid. Now his survival ability was as excellent as a cockroach’s.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pon knew this better than anyone else, so he once again one-sidedly used Vantner as a tanker.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"True Illusion!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaaaaah! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The ancient weapon fired magic power at Vantner, and at the same time, it was stabbed dozens of times.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pon made a satisfied noise as he saw it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"My skills are indeed perfect."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An axe flew at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Those two are still acting like that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The city.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Faker smiled as he watched Pon and Vantner in the distance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Faker told them,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Pay attention to the opponent in front of you. There was no room for cockiness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 1st ranked assassin didn’t participate in the National Competition. When the top rankers spent time at the National Competition, he focused solely on leveling up. As a result, he was now level 293 and 17th on the unified ranking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He showed the result of his training.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Papat!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pa pa pa pat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">He created 20 clones and climbed the ancient weapons from all sides.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The ancient weapon was in the middle of the city, so it was covered with the blood of many people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The humans were so weak that the golem disregarded them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The ancient weapon was astonished.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was because the 20 daggers stabbed in its body caused it great damage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Holes were made in its solid body.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaaaaah! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">These humans were unlike anyone the ancient weapon had encountered before, so it swung its arms like windmills to somehow shake them off. Faker didn’t try to defend himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Instead, he just moved forward. He moved in an incredibly agile manner and avoided the attack of the ancient weapon, rushing at its neck.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kyak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The confused ancient weapon opened its mouth to launch magic power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker threw five daggers into the mouth of the ancient weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The daggers exploded.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Then another ancient weapon flopped to the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it’s commitment was great. In the midst of its collapse, it swung its arm and attacked Faker.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Faker was unable to freely move during the descent and was in a crisis.&nbsp;</span><span style="">An assassin’s health and defense was extremely low, so he could die from this attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'It is failure at a critical moment.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment that Faker frowned, a lightning bolt struck from the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The lightning bolt was powerful enough to completely shift the orbit of the gigantic arm heading towards Faker.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Faker shifted his gaze towards the person who prevented his death. Then he saw a beautiful blonde girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker cried out,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“That girl...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Euphemina...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina had completely shattered Faker’s group in the past. Due to that, she climbed onto the Tzedakah Guild’s kill list.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, that was in the past. The Tzedakah Guild didn’t exist anymore. In the future, she would be a colleague.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker forgot about the past and thanked her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I owe you a debt.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina smiled awkwardly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Among all the guild members, Ibellin wasn’t shining as brightly. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Lauel, can you bind the ancient weapon with Dragon’s Wings?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I can only bind it for one second.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That will be enough."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel was known as the strongest among the 10 Rookies and Ibelline was the second strongest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Once they joined forces, they showed amazing results.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wind Dragon’s Wings!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The target’s movements have been bound.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Laceration!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Laceration]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The target’s body will be brutally torn open by Thorn. The target will receive fixed damage equal to 60% of their current health.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Mana Cost: 500</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Usage Condition: Target must be in a bound state.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chwachachachak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The Thorn of Deep Grievance ripped through the ancient weapon with no mercy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The ancient weapon was severely damaged by a single strike and fell into a stunned state.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an incredible sight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The powerful ancient weapon lost 60% of its health in one shot?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The attack power that Ibellin showed was within Grid’s level, so Lauel was incredible confused. He was alarmed because this guy showed better skills than he thought.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he pretended to be unconcerned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I guess even slugs have a talent for rolling around on the ground.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ibellin shouted angrily,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Who are you calling a slug? Dammit! I will soon be able to surpass you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel snorted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“This is just the power of items.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel was also an overgeared person.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, Grid was confronting an ancient weapon in front of the inner wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Have strength!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">King Wiesbaden desperately encouraged Grid from the walls.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After a while, a satisfied smile appeared on Grid’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Transcended Link. Linked Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Subtle emotions crossed the faces of King Wiesbaden and the nobles. The 100,000 users in Reinhardt and the millions of viewers watched as two of the best skills were used in succession.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Flash!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A white light got rid of the darkness.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Steim watched the artificial white sky and shouted excitedly,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"My son-in-law is a legend!"</span></p>
