 <p><span style="">Chapter 296</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">[All resources will be restored to the maximum in commemoration of reaching level 300.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It happened at level 100 and level 200.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Health, mana and even stamina were completely restored, encouraging the party’s morale.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Very good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid stretched and stood upright.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As his wounds were restored by the level up, he declared to the vampires.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You’ve been waiting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The aftermath of the various stats awakening was abnormally high.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was beyond imagination.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even Grid was surprised.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The vampires were shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The person who was dying just a moment ago now swiftly attacked, showing ridiculous attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this…? Kyaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 20 vampires surrounding Grid immediately collapsed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The blue and jade lights flashed all over the place, while blood and flesh scattered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Death with one blow!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Reign supreme!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The words that could represent the present Grid were exaggerated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was truly overwhelming!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Oh my, look at this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A mere mortal couldn’t grasp who they were going against, it was unpleasant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A True Blood vampire about to bite Vantner stood up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her name was Lexi.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She had exceptional magic power and skill in blood magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Give me a handful of blood. Blood Chain.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puhahahak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The blood emitted by Lexi split into dozens of stems and surrounded Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a wide area magic that bound and attacked the target, and was difficult to avoid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, it wasn’t a threat to the current Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His enhanced agility and insight allowed Grid to use more sophisticated movements.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He avoided the first two blood flows and used Revolve.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The blood streams that should’ve wrapped around Grid reversed directions and covered Lexi.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kyaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Who would’ve thought that she would be hit by her own attack?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lexi became an unexpected victim and screamed in pain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid neared where she was trapped and swung Failure towards her chest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was no such thing as mercy to women.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lexi’s eyes widened with surprise.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This human could damage the body of a True Blood vampire that was harder than steel?&nbsp;</span><span style="">She looked at the huge wound on her chest and used a spell.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Blood Shield!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Using the blood spurting from her chest, Lexi unfolded multiple shields in the air and tried to open the distance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was useless.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjeejeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The red shields were smashed by the jade greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Kill, aimed at Lexi.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lexi tried to prevent it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She turned to smoke to prevent the dreadful greatsword precisely aiming at her pretty face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Lifael’s Spear flew around Grid, defending against the vampire’s attacks before aiming at Lexi’s chest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The smoke was lost and Lexi’s body was clearly revealed again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eek!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lexi raised her arms and covered her face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her appearance was pitiful, but her arms could exert a defense superior to steel shields.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, it was mere paper in front of the damage of Kill that came from the Doppelganger’s Greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a sound like a watermelon cracking.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Crash!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A True Blood vampire might have eternal life, but even they were bound to die if they lost their heads.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lexi collapsed like a broken doll and turned into a grey light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The True Blood vampire, Lexi has been destroyed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[56,901,500 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Sixth Piece of ??? has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[An Intermediate Vampire’s Ring has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He didn’t know exactly what the ‘??? Piece’ was yet. He could only infer that it was a fragment of something made by the same mineral as Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wasn’t sure if it was a jackpot, but the Intermediate Vampire’s Ring was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Intermediate Vampire’s Ring]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* During normal attacks, 10% of the damage done to the target will be restored to you as health.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* This effect is only invoked once every 12 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A unique magic power dwells in the vampire’s ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It greatly elevates the wearer’s survival skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 320 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 1</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was able to absorb 5% more health than the Junior Vampire’s Ring, and the cooldown time was three seconds shorter.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid wore the ring without any hesitation. Unfortunately, its function didn’t overlap with the Junior Vampire’s Ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I’m grateful for this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vampire items were very rare, so the Intermediate Vampire’s Ring would be worth hundreds of gold.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Step, step.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid ran through the remnants of vampires and stood in front of the party members, as if protecting them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Everyone has suffered. Now you can rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members looked shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s strength was more than they imagined, so they were speechless.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He became so much stronger just from reaching level 300?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was difficult to tell how high Grid’s total stats were.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This guyyyy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The aggro of the vampires instantly focused on Grid after Lexi died. The two True Blood vampires were also mixed in.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members were worried, but Grid was pleased.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was grateful that the prey came to him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Just as Elfin Stone saw hunting humans as entertainment, Grid had reached a point where hunting vampires could be viewed as entertainment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Wave.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kurururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The waves of energy!&nbsp;</span><span style="">The vampires were swept away by a terrible pain and realized something.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Humans weren’t a subspecies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their potential was even greater than the vampires.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They weren’t a species to be ignored and treated like cattle.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">A black magician was more difficult to solo than attack classes because they specialized in debuff magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Black magicians hunting alone was considered a penance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most black magicians focused on party-oriented play.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But with the exception of special circumstances, more parties preferred buffers over debuffers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Black magicians couldn’t easily find parties, making it difficult to find them in the rankings.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Except of course for Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was a mythical figure who maintained her fifth spot in the unified rankings despite being a black magician.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was special. A genius among genii.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was evaluated like this, and many users yearned for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This precious talent suddenly visited Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel and the Overgeared members couldn’t help being excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What brings a person like you to this humble city?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel asked her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel also admired Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What guy wouldn’t have a crush on a world-class beauty who was good at games?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura smiled brightly at Lauel and the Overgeared members, whose eyes were shining like lanterns.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ahh, so beautiful and brilliant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were convinced that her presence contributed to world peace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I want to join Overgeared. Youngwoo-ssi... No, Grid has already agreed, so please check with him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura's smile captivated Lauel and the Overgeared members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They let out surprised yelps.&nbsp;</span><span style="">One of the solo rankers, apart from Kraugel and Agnbus, was asking to join Overgeared!&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was shocking but joyful.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Welcome!”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura thought that his words and phrases resembled Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel would probably be shocked if she knew what she was thinking. But it was the truth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The longer he spent with Grid, the more Lauel resembled Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel liked Grid from the bottom of his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he didn’t want to be similar to Grid.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The epic battle ended.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Brilliant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid, you were cool.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kyah! Truly God Grid! Do you know God Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Are those the only English words you know...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members were able to escape from the crisis and praised Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the good atmosphere didn’t last long.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was true that Grid was stronger than expected, but could he take down Elfin Stone?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid spoke to the worried party.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t waste time on worrying. There is one hour left until Elfin Stone appears. In order to increase the odds, we need to recover as much stamina as possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s state was the worst.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members constantly supported him, but he fought against almost 100 vampires alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His whole body was wounded and his items durability was low.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He wondered if he could fully recover his stamina before Elfin Stone appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid had a trump card.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Item Combination]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Two items with a 100% understanding can be combined to enhance the performance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The performance of the combined items will depend on the compatibility between the items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The combination retention time is limited to two minutes. Once this time limit is over, the items will return to their original appearance. At this time, the durability of the items will decrease by 50. This is consumed on a fixed basis.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The time it takes for the combination to occur will depend on the structure of the item.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Mana Cost: 1,000</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 6 hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What if he combined Failure and Lifael’s Spear?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It will be a great weapon if the advantages are maximized.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid believed that he could create the strongest weapon that would defeat Elfin Stone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he kept in mind that the combination time was only two minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">In addition, he was anxious since the time it took to combine items wasn’t precisely specified.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I wish I could experiment with it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Newly acquired skills always made people excited.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid shared the sentiment and wanted to try out Item Combination.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there was the cooldown time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He needed it when dealing with Elfin Stone, so he had to restrain himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Well, it will be okay. I have a strong style.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid evaluated himself and relaxed. Then he started repairing his items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There wasn’t much time left before Elfin Stone’s emergence.</span></p>
