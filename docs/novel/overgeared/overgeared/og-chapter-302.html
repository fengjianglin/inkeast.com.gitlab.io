 <p><span style="">Chapter 302</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s party would fail at the Elfin Stone raid. It was regrettable, but it couldn't be helped. Elfin Stone was too strong.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members all thought so, except for Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She believed that Grid would produce results that would overturn everyone’s expectations.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This wasn’t an inadequate belief that stemmed from her liking towards him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because she became a Demon Slayer and realized the power of a legendary class.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Didn’t struggling with the strong help you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She believed that Grid would succeed in the raid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura smiled at Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s expression was full of confidence as he replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, it was a very big help."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was an insurmountable wall in Grid’s consciousness.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was none other than Hell Gao.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The great demon whose body was sealed by Sword Saint Muller, with only the soul remaining.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was very strong. It was impossible to defeat him unless the fire stones were taken.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But now it was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was comparable to Hell Gao. No, he might even be stronger after gaining the experience of defeating Elfin Stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Sooner or later, I will hunt Hell Gao again.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then it would be different from the past.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid would raid Hell Gao without resorting to the fire stones, and would eventually reach a higher ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I must become the best.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He didn’t want to ever sacrifice his colleagues again due to his own helplessness. It was enough to only experience that dirty feeling once.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s expression as he vowed was more mature than before.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The growth of the 28 year old youth was continuing without stopping.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How charming would he be once he was over 30 years old?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura’s heart thumped at the thought.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She trembled as Grid stared at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“But why is your level so low? The 5th place ranker is only level 203? Have you been cheating people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was this?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He seemed to go back to the time when he spat things out without thinking.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Yura accepted it well.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She thought he was better than a man who was pretentious or always bluffed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Check my class.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Class? Aren’t you a black magician?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid only saw Yura’s level in the guild members information and belatedly confirmed her class. Then he was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Demon Slayer? What is this? Huh? Uh? L-Legendary...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the press conference for the 1st National Competition, Lim Cheolho had stated this:&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were a total of nine legendary classes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, two legendary classes were part of Overgeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s heart was overflowing with joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You are really welcome!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was so happy he wanted to embrace her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he didn’t want to be labelled as a molester and refrained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After that.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid left Reidan with Yura and Huroi. It was to join up with the Pavranium Expedition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had 84 days left in his quest to secure the remaining pavranium.&nbsp;</span><span style="">City 13 was one of the most difficult ones, and it was already cleared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their power was strengthened, so it would be easier to secure the rest of the pavranium.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The 13th vampire city.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After Grid died killing Elfin Stone, the surviving party members searched all over the city.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The ultimate goal of this expedition was to secure the pavranium.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was difficult to find.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The scale of the city was too big and it was also dark.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The torches have already run out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If I had known this, I would’ve packed more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Zednos. You’re a third advancement magician, and yet you can’t use any light magic?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I only learned wind magic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Sigh, you should learn the basic spells, regardless of attribute.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m willing to continue with this path. Who knows? If I keep learning only one type of magic, I might obtain a hidden class.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh... What if we ask for Minor to be sent? He would find it quickly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let’s look a little more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Four more hours passed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They killed the scattered remnants of the vampires’ familiars while searching and eventually found a deep cave.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The entrance was covered by a rock wall, making it look like a secretive and suspicious place.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This seems like it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner took the lead.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moment when all the people behind him entered the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Guardian of the Labyrinth has detected an intruder and woken up from a long sleep.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The traps have been activated.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Papat!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pa pa pa pat!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwarururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A rain of arrows fell from the ceiling while spikes rose up from the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The chain lightning that came from the walls was stronger than many magicians.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the past, Grid couldn’t cope with the damage from Braham’s traps and survived due to his immortal passive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was somewhat lacking to threaten the current Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Titan.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuwaaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner summoned an illusionary giant. It was a skill that increased the physical defense power of each party member, as well as blocking the projectiles.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjeejeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Most of the arrows were neutralized by the giant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The thorns rising from the ground pierced the soles of their feet, but the increase in defense allowed them to avoid any fatal wounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wind Curtain!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chain Lighting was weakened by Zednos’ magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to that, the party members could escape from the traps.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Two very large golems were waiting for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Wow, they’re huge. Aren’t they a bit bigger than the ancient weapons that attacked Reinhardt?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This golem...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka and Vantner were familiar with these golems.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The two people thought about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“They resemble the golem that Grid fought when he obtained the pavranium.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"However, they look much bigger and stronger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It means this place definitely has pavranium.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Okay, let’s take them down lightly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The two guardians of the labyrinth!&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were 150 levels higher than the golems that Grid defeated in the past. They were also stronger than the ancient weapons that invaded Reinhardt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the Overgeared members also grew. The golems couldn’t exert any power against the elites of the Overgeared Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No matter how high their stats, the golems had simple defensive patterns, so they weren’t a threat to rankers who had transcendent control skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The defense is quite high.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Slow down and concentrate on the feet. Knock it down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Zednos, look for the mana core. Then I can deal fatal damage to the mana core with my quick-draw sword technique.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kurururu!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">20 minutes after the battle started.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The guardians of the labyrinth had high defense and health, but they eventually collapsed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The party members’ expressions brightened as they identified all the minerals that dropped.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was because they imagined Grid’s happiness.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As they were thinking this, someone’s voice was delivered into their minds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Now dogs and cows dare touch my things.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dog?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cow?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was referring to them, who were in the top 20 of two billion users?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Who are you to say that?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner growled and asked the voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[I am the great magician Braham.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham was looking forward to it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wanted to see their terrified reactions when they heard his name.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the Overgeared members responded in a completely unexpected way.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It’s just a specter of the past.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You’re the one who installed the traps? You have a sneaky personality.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If you’re dead, you should leave peacefully. Why are you staying in this world to harm people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Give us the pavranium.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You guys...!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham knew that the intruders were Grid’s subordinates.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was thanks to Euphemina, who was currently in the Siren Kingdom. Braham had watched them through Mumud’s Orb when she had been staying at Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Braham didn’t like them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You truly fit together! All of you are just like Pagma’s Descendant!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid, the thief who stole the pavranium instead of making the Vessel of the Soul.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even now, he was sending his minions to rob Braham’s pavranium.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an act that couldn’t be forgiven.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[I will show you!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid would take a direct hit if he killed these guys!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Braham pulled out the weapon he had prepared for when he would reunite with Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Mumud!]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">An old coffin emerged from the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members were surprised at the sight of the coffin.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Another vampire?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What magician can summon a vampire?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members determined that it was a vampire, but this was a big mistake.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Creak.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a skeleton, not a vampire, that emerged from the open coffin.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Skeleton?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In Satisfy, skeletons were summoned using bones.&nbsp;</span>What skeleton was kept in a coffin?&nbsp;<span style="">Zednos turned pale as he found the orb in the skeleton’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Mumud...! I knew that name was familiar. He was Braham’s disciple!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Then?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That skeleton, it’s a lich!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A lich was on a different dimension from a skeleton.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They possessed infinite magic power and were rumored to surpass the 10 great magicians of the continent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Braham’s soul fluttered as he identified the nervous reactions of the Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Demands are a privilege of the strong. You want me to give you the pavranium? You children who don’t understand who you are going against, I will punish you.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kiyaaaaaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The lich stood up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The magic power emitted by it was reminiscent of Elfin Stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Let’s escape. We can wait until Grid comes back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, we don’t have to fight it now. Let’s go back safely.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were still exhausted after the Elfin Stone raid. The risk was high and there was no merit to fighting the lich without a plan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members quickly judged the situation and tried to escape.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Step step.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">At that moment, someone’s footsteps were heard in the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Perhaps?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid always appeared with perfect timing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was like a character in a movie who appeared in a moment of crisis.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a person who made them feel a strange anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I finally found it. Lich Mumud.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members thought the footsteps belonged to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their brightened faces distorted instantly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They never imagined the true identity of the owner of the footsteps.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why are there so many guests?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A man appeared in front of the Overgeared members and the lich.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He swept back his pale green hair and scanned the Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Look at these guys who are rushing around because they received their third advancement. Don’t you know how to play alone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Who could speak in such an unreasonable manner to the prestigious Overgeared members?&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was only one person.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This man had the nickname of Crazy Person. Or Mad Dog.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Agnus...!”</span></p>
