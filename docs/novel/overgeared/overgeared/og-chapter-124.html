 <p><span style="">Chapter 124</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">A transparent arrow, visible to only Grid’s eyes, was pointed at Isabel’s spear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the helper system that guided the user.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Like every other user, Grid received a lot of help from this system in the early days.&nbsp;It helped him even after he became Pagma's Descendant, like with the bellows.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Anyway, this meant the system was telling him that the spear was a clue to this quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I see,” Grid reminded himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the case of quests with an extremely high failure penalty, the system was set up to help the user succeed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hey, Isabel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Isabel, who had been feeling despair over Luna, frowned at the call.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid told her,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I will kill the pope and then rescue Rin.&nbsp;In return, give me my shield. Understood?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“....”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Isabel felt an unknown sense of trust from Grid’s absurd words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Believe in him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Somehow, she seemed to hear the voice of Goddess Rebecca.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Really?&nbsp;Will you really save Rin?&nbsp;Has Goddess Rebecca condemned His Holiness?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid nodded at her question and replied,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Yes, that’s what the sky said.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He approached Isabel and grabbed her spear that the arrow was pointing towards.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Isabel panicked because Grid once again touched the sacred spear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid ignored her and used a skill,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Legendary Blacksmith’s Appraisal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The blacksmith who becomes a legend can appraise items with an excellent discerning eye.&nbsp;If a hidden feature exists in the target item, it will be found.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Sealed Lifael’s Spear]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Legendary</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 1,000/1,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 730~1,270</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Divine Power +1,500</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* All stats +60.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* 100% increase in health recovery.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Fixed damage of +2,000 on each attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* There is a high probability of activating the ‘Light Wheel’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* There is a high probability of activating the ‘Shield of Light’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* There is a high probability of activating the ‘Light of Guidance’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The skill ‘White Transformation’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Attack power +20% against those with dark magic power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It is one of the three divine artifacts of the Rebecca Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 5th Pope Franz asked the legendary blacksmith Pagma to seal its power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Conditions of Use: Rebecca's Daughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 400</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the case of ‘Failure’ which Grid created without considering the balance, the conditions of use were ridiculously high but the performance was superior to common sense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And Lifael’s Spear was a weapon that was almost like Failure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the surprising thing was that it was sealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Pagma sealed it?&nbsp;Why?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment that Grid was feeling admiration.&nbsp;A white flash emerged from the spear!&nbsp;Then a golden glow appeared and a notification window popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have discovered a hidden feature in the item!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Lifael’s Spear]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Myth</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 1,500/1,500 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 2,330~2,890</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Divine Power +3,000</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* All stats +200</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* 300% increase in health recovery.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Fixed damage of +5,000 on each attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* There is a high probability of activating the ‘Light Wheel’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* There is a high probability of activating the ‘Shield of Light’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* There is a high probability of activating the ‘Light of Guidance’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The skill ‘White Transformation’ will always be invoked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Attack power +50% against those with dark magic power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It is one of the three divine artifacts of the Rebecca Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It contains a tremendous divine power that human beings can’t afford to handle, placing a heavy burden on the user’s mind and body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Since Rebecca’s Daughters became short-lived after being unable to cope with the power of this weapon, 5th Pope Franz asked Pagma to seal its power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, Pagma's Descendant emerged during the 13th Pope’s reign and was able to discover the true power of the weapon, unsealing it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Conditions of Use: Rebecca's Daughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 400</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have witnessed a god-made weapon!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Insight has increased by 200.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your insight stat has exceeded 500.&nbsp;You will see the world differently from before.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[All blacksmith related skill levels have increased by +1.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You can now produce myth rated items.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It transcended even ‘Failure.’&nbsp;No, this was a weapon strong enough to disrupt the balance of the world itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Myth rated items...’&nbsp;</span><span style="">He never imagined that items higher than a legendary rating existed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘Myth rated items, does that mean I am able to make items like Dainsleif?&nbsp;Rather...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a new experience for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is a jackpot.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were numbers listed above Isabel, Luna and Cassus’ head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Isabel had 55,000 above her head.&nbsp;Luna had 26,300.&nbsp;Cassus had 4,000.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Through Grid’s increased insight, he was aware of what these numbers meant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Their combat power.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuoooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">An enormous golden energy started to explode from Isabel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Due to the awakened Lifael’s Spear, the skill ‘White Transformation’ was automatically activated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Isabel’s combat power started to climb until it reached 120,000.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“It is convenient but...&nbsp;What is this?&nbsp;I’m not the protagonist of a manhwa.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">100 years ago, there was a manhwa that was regarded as one of the best masterpieces and created a craze all over the world.&nbsp;The manhwa characters could measure the target’s combat power with a machine or ability.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why did an ability from a manhwa 100 years ago appear?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was only complaining with his mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was well aware of how useful the newly acquired ability could be.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, Luna was looking at Isabel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She had admired Isabel’s beautiful hair for a long time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Luna’s hair was colorful and curly, while Isabel’s hair was platinum and long, like beautiful silk.&nbsp;Luna coveted it more than jewellery.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now Isabel’s beautiful hair was influenced by the explosion of divine power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I have to fight.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Luna also liked Rin.&nbsp;She followed Rin like they were actual sisters.&nbsp;It was the same with Isabel.&nbsp;Isabel was as good as Rin.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Luna had to fight.&nbsp;She was taught to obey commands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the end, Luna also used White Transformation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her combat strength only reached 50,000.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The difference in combat power was obvious.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Isabel will win this fight.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was confident, while Isabel was feeling confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“H-How did this happen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lifael’s Spear became much more powerful than before.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a power that couldn’t be controlled.&nbsp;It seemed like she could beat any opponent.&nbsp;She was confident that she could penetrate Everiel’s Shield, which boasted a high defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hey.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She was panicking as she felt her divine power rising indefinitely when Grid reached out to her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He spoke as if he was blessing her, “Have strength.&nbsp;I will go rescue Rin first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Um...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As soon as she heard Rin’s name, Isabel recovered his spirit and grasped the spear tightly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She felt a desire to fight Luna.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Okay.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Isabel was motivated by the mention of Rin.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now Isabel would fight to save Rin.&nbsp;She would defeat Luna and kill the pope.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was perfect insurance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This would allow him to clear the quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Let’s go!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid entered the Vatican after passing through Luna, who was blocked by Isabel.&nbsp;He ran down a long hallway while pulling out Dainsleif and the Frostlight Orc Chief’s Helmet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he felt something from the innermost giant doors that were closed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid kicked the doors with his feet.&nbsp;He witnessed the pope standing on the other end of the red carpet like a villain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That guy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The bewildered pope asked.&nbsp;Grid examined the situation before replying.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A man and woman were surrounded by dozens of paladins and priests.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It seemed like he appeared at an exquisite moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yes, just like a character from a movie.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid laughed at the atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A protagonist?&nbsp;I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He answered and put a hand on his belt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Kenen’s Dart Belt]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The favorite belt of Kenen, a master of assassination who made many people panic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One dart will be charged every 20 seconds and up to three darts can be charged.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The type of dart generated is random, and it will have different effects depending on the type.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Conditions of Use: Assassin&nbsp;Throwing Technique Level 7 or above.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 140</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an item dropped by Sniffer when he died.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was similar to an infinite quiver, but the infinite quiver commonly had fixed types of arrows. But this belt produced random darts.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was a disadvantage, but Grid tried using it on the way here and the performance was very interesting.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'That bastard, he must be crying tears of blood after dropping this item.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Really stupid. A PK user had a very high probability of dropping items upon death.&nbsp;They dared to attack even knowing the risk, how stupid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Papapat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid laughed and threw darts towards the pope.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Block it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The paladins used their shields to protect the pope.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The darts hit the shields and caused a smoke screen.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid clicked his tongue.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"There is the poison fog function, so why is this just plain smoke?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As expected, he had no luck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He scowled as he moved quickly and rescued Rin and Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he checked their combat power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Oh, isn’t this great?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian’s combat power was 12,500.&nbsp;It was very powerful for a user, considering that Rin had 27,000.&nbsp;He must be a top ranker.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He seemed to be a paladin, so he should be useful as a tanker.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid told him,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Invite me into the party. Also, can I have all the items that the pope drops?&nbsp;I think that is sufficient for saving your life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The silence was a positive agreement!&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the first place, Damian must be completing a similar type of quest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was convinced that Damian couldn’t refuse, so he set the party leader to acquire the items and sent a party invitation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the desperate Damian was forced to accept the party.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was happy as he confirmed the party information.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'As expected, he is a top ranker.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian was a huge level 227.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was similar to the average level of the Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;It meant he was within the top 200 of users.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian was also stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The main character who emerged in an urgent situation and saved the heroine!&nbsp;The person had such a strong ambiance, yet he was only level 150?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He thought Goddess Rebecca had given him a lifeline, but it was just a rotten lifeline.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moment that Damian was feeling regret.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwarurung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A red lightning bolt pierced the roof of the Vatican and nestled in a black greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pachichik!</span></i><i><span style="">Pachik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The appearance of a greatsword with red currents around it was very powerful.&nbsp;It was certainly a unique rated item.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'That weapon is amazing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian was feeling admiration when Grid asked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“As a paladin, can’t you use buff skills?&nbsp;Please use buffs on me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Originally, Rebecca paladins couldn’t use buff skills.&nbsp;It was common sense that everyone should know.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Damian awakened his abilities and received a buff skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He checked the information on his newly acquired skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Light's Blessing]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You and your party’s defense, attack power and accuracy will increase by 80% for 3 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Mana Cost: 900</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 300 seconds</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Heart's Desire]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The dead will be immediately resurrected on the spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* This doesn’t apply to NPCs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Mana consumption: 80% of the maximum mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 24 hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Amazing skills.&nbsp;A buff skill more powerful than Light's Blessing didn’t exist yet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In addition, the resurrection skill was a top-tier skill that even second advancement Rebecca priests hadn’t acquired.&nbsp;Perhaps he was currently the only one with a resurrection skill in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Yes, this user might be weak but if I use these skills well...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Maybe it was worth fighting.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian used Light's Blessing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Wow."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid sincerely admired the buff effect.&nbsp;Then he started to show his transcendent sword dance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian was confused as he watched the man dance instead of attacking.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Grid stopped dancing and discharged a red and black sword aura.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Keok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian was so amazed that he hiccuped.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Every time this man swung his sword, the 23 high ranking paladins that the church was so proud of would become injured.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The priests struggled to save the paladins from the ruthless bombardment, but the speed at which the sword auras were flying was much faster than the heals.&nbsp;Three or four swords flew while the priests could only use Heal once.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The heals could no longer keep up and the paladins had to retreat, meaning there were no longer any people protecting the pope.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid spoke to the indignant pope,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Were you relying on them to protect you?&nbsp;How tragic.”</span></p>
