 <p><span style="">Chapter 125</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The pope shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Don’t you know who I am? I am Pope Drevigo! I am the parent of 70 million people and as the agent of the goddess, the most sacred being in the world! You dare point a sword at me? This infidel, you aren’t afraid of divine punishment!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hrmm.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid listened quietly before saying something.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"You spat at me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What? Disgraceful person!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had never been insulted like this until now.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A paladin was helping the traitor and now this?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The pope’s head turned red with anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will punish you myself! Don’t think about leaving here alive!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid glared at him coldly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"You are always talking about divine punishment... Pope, you haven’t grasped the situation yet? I have come here to inflict divine punishment on you. You are the one who will be punished, not me. So shouldn’t you act a little better? Tsk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t just the pope who wasn’t happy with this situation. Grid felt the same.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If the pope was a normal person, it would’ve been easy to clear the quest to get the pavranium blessed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the pope was a corrupt man and endangered the Rebecca Church, causing Grid to struggle unnecessarily because of the quest changing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The introduction I received from my father-in-law is useless... You, this is really annoying.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid nervously squeezed Dainsleif. Then his sword aimed at the pope.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the pope wasn’t going to stand still. He responded by launching light magic power.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A powerful explosion occurred as a white flash and black flash collided. Due to the aftermath, 10m of the long carpet was burnt to pieces.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The remnants of the carpet fell like red eyes looking at Grid with disapproval.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘My sword was blocked?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s sword was enhanced by the red lightning bolt and Damian’s buff skill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The fact that he couldn’t win against the pope’s magic was basically proof that the pope’s magic power was stronger than Grid’s sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘My attack power right now is higher than Malacus’ magic power. Malacus himself would fail to stop me, even if he unfolded a three-layer shield.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid couldn’t understand it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His increased insight showed that the pope had a combat power of 24,000.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Given Damian’s combat power of 12,500 as a level 227 ranker, 24,000 didn’t seem very high.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Just looking at the numerical value, two Damians would be able to exert combat power over the pope.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Based on Damian... The Tzedakah Guild has an average combat power of 12,000 at the time of the Malacus raid...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">17 guild members were involved in the Malacus raid. If the average 12,000 combat power of each person was combined, the total combat strength would be over 200,000.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But didn’t they get overwhelmed by Malacus’ strength, even with a combined combat power of over 200,000?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In other words, Malacus should have at least 200,000 combat power and the pope in front of him should be 10 times weaker than Malacus because he only had 24,000 combat power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But after an exchange of blows, the pope felt stronger than Malacus. It was curious.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Well...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s high insight allowed him to understand the concept of combat power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'A small gap in combat power is, in reality, a large gap to cover.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s assertion was correct. While Rebecca’s Daughters, the pope, and Damian’s attack power were all valued in the tens and hundreds of thousands, actual combat power was delicate enough to feel when there was even a single digit difference.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The concept of combat power wasn’t 1+1=2.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Let’s assume that an attack power of 1 was an ant and an attack power of 2 was a praying mantis. It was impossible for two ants to beat a praying mantis.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Therefore, combat power was 1+1 &lt; 2.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was how the 17 Tzedakah Guild members were overwhelmed by the lone Malacus.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The sum of combat power is meaningless. 17 cats gathered together can’t beat one elephant. And the pope is a top predator that can devour an elephant. Isn’t he incredibly strong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cat? Elephant? What are you saying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The pope couldn’t understand Grid’s words.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid grinned at his confusion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I am a cat or an elephant. This is an opportunity to gauge which one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I don’t know what you are talking about. Infidel, are you crazy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Don’t worry too much about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid wasn’t discouraged despite learning that the pope was much stronger than Malacus. Rather, his blood was boiling with excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I wonder how far my strength will prevail!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had learned how to use his weapons freely during the Guardian of the Labyrinth raid. Lacking destructive power could be covered with control.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">In Grid’s hands, Dainsleif slashed at a different angle each time, the sword auras all flying in different orbits.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Some flew to the front, to the side and to the rear of the pope.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unless the pope had eyes all over the place, it was impossible to intercept them all with magic!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid smiled with satisfaction.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the pope was more formidable than Grid expected.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The pope continuously unfolded his light magic power and intercepted Grid’s energy swords one by one.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This won’t work!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A wide area light magic attack was emitted along with the pope’s shout.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an overwhelming sight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The white magic power spread like sunlight and shattered the black energy swords.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid stared at the brilliant light that was slowly disappearing and truly admired it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Really strong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was he feeling discouraged?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, that wasn’t it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay! I have to do my best!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a unique buff skill just for Pagma's Descendant. He could only use it for himself, but the effect was extraordinary.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Blacksmith’s Rage!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Blacksmith’s Rage has been activated. Your attack power and attack speed will increase significantly for 20 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ohhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid doubled the speed with which he wielded Dainsleif. It meant that his attack speed had doubled.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The attacks poured down like a heavy rain due to Grid wielding the sword without a break!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hah...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The pope’s face turned white.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He continuously fired light magic, but the speed of the light magic couldn’t keep up with Grid’s speed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Once again, the pope released light magic around himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was planning to sweep away all of Grid’s energy swords again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But this time, the result was different.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Blacksmith's Rage strengthened the power of the energy swords, causing the power of light to be destroyed instead. Then the swords landed on the pope’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You have become stronger? Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The light magic couldn’t withstand the power of the swords, and the pope’s body was hit again and again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The pope’s terrible scream echoed in the hall as notification windows appeared in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 13,300 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 13,910 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 14,080 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Best Gauntlets option effect is activated, causing you to attack the target twice.] </span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 28,300 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 31,050 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The pope’s health gauge was dwindling at an incredible pace.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was able to determine the pope’s total health by comparing the amount of damage suffered to the pope’s health gauge.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is it around 300,000?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Guardian of the Labyrinth had a total health greater than 1.2 million.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was a golem, not a human. The pope was a human being. His inherent health was lower compared to monsters, so this increased Grid’s confidence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can catch him with around 20 more hits?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He might be able to overcome the pope without Isabel’s help.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Puhahahat! The pope should die and drop some items!”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid burst out while expecting victory. He attacked the pope relentlessly and the health gauge ended up dropping to a quarter.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the duration of Transcend and Blacksmith's Rage was over.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’ll drive in the last wedge here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The pope was in a dying state. His white garments embroidered with gold thread had been torn to pieces a long time ago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid ran towards him. He narrowed the interval to 10m in a short amount of time and used the strongest skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The overwhelming killing intent heated up the atmosphere.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A dark haze surrounded Dainsleif.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moment Dainsleif was about to be stabbed into the pope’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Goddess’ Breath...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The pope used magic. Then the pope’s health gauge was refilled in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A heal that restores hundreds of thousands of health?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The pope’s magic effect didn’t end there. A green translucent shield was unfolded and completely neutralized Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was scared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“What skill is this? Damn, is he a guardian knight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The pope used the invincible skill only meant for guardian knights!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was surprised by the unexpected move and retreated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the pope ridiculed him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The goddess’ divine blessing fully protects my body and soul. No matter what you do, you can’t harm me!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The pope was fundamentally a priest. If Rebecca’s Daughters were the peak of the paladins, the pope was the peak of the priests.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The bloody body was restored and he used a broad heal for the paladins who were severely wounded and had withdrawn from battle. He ordered them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What are you doing? Kill that infidel right away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The paladins didn’t like the pope.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They didn’t want to follow such an evil existence that made their church corrupt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But no matter how depraved the pope, he was obviously an agent of the goddess.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The high rankings paladins were deeply religious and couldn’t imagine rejecting the pope’s order, grabbing their weapons. Then they simultaneously rushed towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No, Damian. What are you doing? Are you just doing to watch?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid reacted nervously as he looked at all the opponents in front of him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian, who had been watching Grid with shock, belatedly recovered his spirit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m sorry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A person who was only level 150 had overwhelmed the pope!&nbsp;</span><span style="">What the hell was Grid’s identity? It was suspicious.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Despite his deep skepticism and confusion, Damian added his power to Grid’s in order to defend Rin.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Chaeng chaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian blocked a paladin’s sword with a shield and fought back. His sword was sharp and the paladins couldn’t easily defend against it. Then blood started to pour out of the paladins.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian was awakened by this quest and received the strongest buff skill. This made him strong enough to overpower the church’s senior paladins.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Both Damian and Grid were unaware of this, but Damian was now stronger than Toban, who was number one on the paladin rankings. He might not be able to defeat 23 paladins with his power alone, but he could tie up their feet for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay! I’ll leave this to you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid determined that Damian alone was enough and rushed to target the pope again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the pope had no intention of allowing his approach.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The pope blasted him with light magic power to stop him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The magician bombardment was concentrated on Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid wanted to avoid it, but it was hard because the pope grasped his movement patterns and reaction rate, using the power of light efficiently. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ack~!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A white ray narrowly passed over the top of the frightened Grid’s head. Then another ray aimed at his face without giving Grid any room to breathe.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid hurriedly used the Divine Shield to defend.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then a notification window popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The durability of the Divine Shield has decreased by 78.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Crazy!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Divine Shield was famous because it was strong against dark magic. But even without such features, the Divine Shield had excellent defense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even with that, the pope’s blow had reduced the shield’s durability by 1/8th.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid lamented.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If only I was holding the legendary rated Divine Shield...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He wanted to get rid of the pope quickly and regain the legendary rated Divine Shield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid placed the shield in front of him and continued to move forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"How dare an infidel carry our battle gear! It is disgraceful!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kwaang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Every time Grid stepped forward, a ray of light magic power flared and struck the Divine Shield. The Divine Shield rapidly distorted and cracks started to appear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It happened when Grid took his seventh step.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The pope thought that his next strike would completely shatter Grid’s shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Grid had no intention of letting his item be destroyed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid identified that the white flash was approached and put away the Divine Shield. Then he armed himself with the Ideal Dagger and used Wind Blast.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The swirling wind slightly twisted the orbit of the white flash. Then the ray brushed past Grid’s cheek.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeok!</span></i><span style=""> Part of the Frostlight Orc Chief’s Helmet was broken and a little bit of Grid’s face was exposed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid endured it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This method worked.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The pope gritted his teeth,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"You still have a lot of tricks left!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The pope was annoyed since that explosion should’ve blown off Grid’s head, and was about to attack again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Two golden discs appeared out of nowhere and stuck to his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment that the pope was panicking.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid used Quick Movements and succeeded in narrowing the gap with the pope. Then he fired Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Link.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pipit!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pipipipipi-!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The attack speed of the dagger was incomparably fast compared to the greatsword. Then Quick Movements maximized his agility.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid used Link after equipping himself with the Ideal Dagger and managed to unleash 22 attacks. While the damage inflicted was less than that of when he used Dainsleif, the dagger’s delicate control made sure that the pope was persistently hit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuaaaak You!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The pope screamed and launched a counterattack, aiming precisely at Grid’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“No!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian screamed as he confirmed that Grid’s health had fallen by more than half with a single strike.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Those who lost more than 40% of their health in a single hit would be stunned and unprotected, meaning Grid was in considerable danger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian wanted to run over to Grid to give him healing and protection, but he couldn’t move because of the paladins.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is the end! This quest will fail! I won’t be able to save Rin-chan!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that moment, something strange thing happened: without taking a single potion, Grid’s health still recovered as he remained unaffected by any abnormal status effects.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid coolly plunged his dagger deep into the pope’s heart.</span></p>
