 <p><span style="">Chapter 410</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">"Mr. Grid, you didn’t fight back despite the one-sided damage caused by this patch. Are you admitting that it’s reasonable for you to be nerfed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Last year, Grid was able to play a role in the National Competition due to his class and items. The result wasn’t due to Grid’s skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This patch was to eliminate that unreasonable thing, so even Grid couldn’t complain if he had a conscience.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reporter interpreted it this way according to his taste.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">From Youngwoo’s position, it was an unpleasant attitude.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had great pride in himself, so if it was one year ago, he would’ve immediately become angry at the reporter.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would’ve snapped angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But now Youngwoo didn’t do that.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He represented Overgeared and South Korea, and this press conference was a live world stage. Therefore, Youngwoo took a deep breath and watched the reporter.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The ID hanging from the reporter’s chest had their name, the name of their media company, and their country.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘French.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One of the candidates to win in the 1st National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The French pointed out Bondre as the person to win the championship for their country.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Bondre was defeated in four seconds after meeting Youngwoo in PvP. This shocking disgrace moved France further away from the championship.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The antagonism that originated at that time, as well as vigilance and anxiety that the same thing might occur this time, dominated the French reporter.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The enlightened Youngwoo felt more sympathetic towards the reporters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘His self-esteem is low.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Just like Youngwoo in the old days.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a strong winner, Youngwoo was able to respond to the reporter in a calm tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Everyone seems to have misunderstood. I’m not a victim of this patch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The French journalist was embarrassed and the audience was agitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A confused Chinese reporter asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Mr. Grid, isn’t your greatest strength your unbeatable attack power? Due to this patch, you lost that strength and will inevitably be in a disadvantageous position in PvP. Compared to the other rankers, isn’t your control relatively lacking?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why is my strength seen as attack power?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You’re the one who logged out Hurent of the United States in just 5 seconds and Bondre of France in just 4 seconds. Attack power is naturally your greatest strength.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hrmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A smile appeared on Youngwoo’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The people watching the broadcast and the reporters couldn’t understand the meaning of this smile.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Yura, Peak Sword, and Regas knew the meaning of Youngwoo’s smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s ridicule.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘How absurd.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The worst personality.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo enjoyed the questions spreading through the reporters and opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You are pure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Suddenly calling them pure? That smile seemed to be laughing at them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo asked a Chinese reporter who had an unpleasant expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is the source of my strong attack power?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It’s obviously your strong items.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"In other words, the power of items. That is the right answer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo explained to the bewildered reporter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"My strength isn’t attack power, but items. And items aren’t just limited to weapons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The eyes of the Chinese reporter widened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He understood the meaning of Youngwoo’s words.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo turned his gaze away from the reporters and declared towards the camera.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If I can’t reproduce the strongest attack power because of the patch, then I will show the strongest defense. I will thoroughly use this patch to look much better than last year.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The nerf sniping at him? He would easily pass through it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pfft!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reporters laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo’s words were too ridiculous.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The blacksmith class is known to have low defense and because of the inherent limit of production classes, I don’t think a legendary blacksmith will be much different.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I’ve never seen you use defensive skills.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It’s common sense that you can’t play as a tanker by just relying on armor, without any defense skills?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You might’ve overcome the limitations of your class with items during the 1st National Competition, where there were only second advancement users, but this year will be different. Other participants have grown stronger by leaps and bounds.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Mr. Grid, you are too obsessed with items.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reporters weren’t wrong.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reporters were experts in Satisfy and had a basis for their words.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the problem was that Youngwoo was a special case.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You will soon see. Ah, I will tell you this ahead of time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo scanned Zibal and Bubat with ridicule.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I don’t think anyone who participates in this competition isn’t equipped with items. The high rankers received a lot of money from sponsors, so it is irresponsible if they don’t have good items. Don’t use bad items as an excuse later on if you have a conscience.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The tone was provocative.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bubat responded to the taunt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Aren’t you the one who relies on items? Don’t speak nonsense! I bet that this year, you will earn 0 gold medals!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal was the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"A person who only relies on items is saying this... I guess there isn’t a lot of talent in South Korea. There is a rumor that Yura, who disappeared from the rankings after obtaining a hidden class, isn’t as good as before. Well, I think it is good enough for South Korea to maintain a low profile in this competition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After that, the reporters didn’t ask Youngwoo anymore questions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an attitude like they were no longer interested in South Korea.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thus, a Korean reporter asked Youngwoo a new question.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid, do you plan to participate in the blacksmith production competition? As a legendary blacksmith, you will surely get a gold medal if you participate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reporter wanted to show to the world that Korea could also get a gold medal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The international reporters read his intentions and stiffened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"A gold medal doesn’t have the same value.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Winning a gold medal in a non-popular event isn’t a big story.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“So what... Whether it is a gold medal in a popular or non-popular event, it still shows in the score. It looks like South Korea won’t leave completely empty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No, that’s wrong as well. Have you seen the performance of the items made by the top ranking blacksmiths lately? There’s no guarantee that Grid can get a gold medal, even if he’s a legendary blacksmith.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Korean reporter’s face reddened with shame as the reaction was different than what he thought.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a fact that anyone knew, but most of the Korean people watching the press conference were angry at the insult.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Knowing this, Youngwoo abandoned his patience and revealed a bit of his true nature. He would give a thrill to the Korean citizens, as well as enhance the image of himself and Overgeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If I participate in the blacksmith competition, isn’t this too unfair?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was natural for blacksmiths to participate in the blacksmith competition. But it was too unfair?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was extremely arrogant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Just because he was a legend, he assumed that all blacksmiths were below him. It was a higher assessment of himself than necessary.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In front of the frowning reporters, Youngwoo raised five fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This is the minimum number of gold medals South Korea will be able to win in this National Competition without me participating in the blacksmith tournament. Expect it."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Everyone was silent from the crazy nonsense.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">[Grid, he declared that he will win at least 5 gold medals.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Grid won’t participate in the blacksmith competition. Can South Korea win a gold medal?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The importance of representatives... South Korea will suffer a great disgrace due to Grid’s arrogance.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The media headlines of each country were dominated by Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, there were only a few small articles about the 2nd ranked Zibal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid, this guy...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Originally, he was supposed to be the main character of the press conference, but that changed due to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His ego was badly hurt as he threw the newspapers to the side with a red face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he asked the young man with silver hair who was enjoying his tea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What do you think are the five events Grid is talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Boss raid, target match and siege.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? The team events?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“And all other combat-related individual events.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel, the youth with silver hair drinking expensive black tea, just spoke ridiculous words.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was the chief of staff of Overgeared and Grid’s chief aide, the person closest to Grid. Still, he was from the United States.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I knew that Grid was arrogant, but this... Does he really believe that he’s the strongest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No, Grid always thought he was lacking.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That’s why it was scarier.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He’s someone who has already broken the sky above the sky.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel shook his head and explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid said this based on his skills.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah, really?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal thought it was absurd.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"How can you evaluate Grid’s skills so highly? Now that the average stats of users are going up and the value of items is decreasing, why are you so obsessed with Grid, who has nothing except for items?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel burst out laughing and swept back his hair. He covered half of his face with one hand, his blue eyes peeking out from the gap in the fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is why I don’t appreciate you, Zibal. Your zeal to judge people and circumstances based on prejudices just proves your limitations. The brightest moment for you is the present, not the future."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal’s face turned completely red as he shook.&nbsp;</span>He tried not to get angry at Lauel, who was disparaging him.&nbsp;<span style="">Then Lauel spoke some shocking words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Tomorrow, in the target match, the US is looking for a silver medal.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was natural that the US would win gold at team events.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The US team’s overall ability was high when taking into consideration the average level, equipment, and skills of the participants.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yet they were looking at a silver medal?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel continued to speak nonsense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"When I pierce through the world with my eyes, the winner of the gold medal is South Korea.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal pounded on the table, standing up and glaring at Lauel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I know that you’re loyal to Grid... But keep in mind that your country is always your priority. You are Grid’s enemy in the National Competition. Don’t mislead your allies and encourage confusion with your words.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will keep that in mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel laughed excitedly, like this was refreshing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Zibal hurriedly left this place. It was because he would crush Lauel’s pretty face if he stayed any longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">And the next day.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After the grand opening ceremony, which was much bigger than the 1st National Competition, the first scheduled event began.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the target processing match.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The rules were simple.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The S.A. Group designated 21 uninhabited islands for this National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The representatives of 32 countries would be on the uninhabited island called ‘Tira.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Each representative had to destroy small targets 5cm in diameter that were moving at a speed of 40m per second. Each target would give points, and the representatives could be attacked and logged out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Destroying one target gave one point, and no additional points were gained by logging out another user.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The country that earned a total of 400 points first would win.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Which country will be the first to win 400 points in this match? 』&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-Waaahhhhhhhh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Hundreds of thousands of spectators cheered in the Stade de France National Stadium as the host raised the atmosphere.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Among them, very few people were paying attention to South Korea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Despite Grid’s declaration at the press conference, almost no one predicted that South Korea could win a medal at the team events.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But let’s go back to the situation from the beginning.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peng!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">White flashes emerged from four golden hands shining brilliantly under the sun.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At the same time as the signal to start the match, the small targets were destroyed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The speed was fast enough to be unmatched by other teams.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Stop him!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The bewildered representatives from all over the world surrounded Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Linked Kill Wave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid used his strongest skill while feeling thankful to the enemies coming at him all at once.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The result?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Silence filled the agitated Stade de France National Stadium.</span></p>
