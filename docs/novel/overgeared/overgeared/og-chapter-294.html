 <p><span style="">Chapter 294</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“What method…? How can we escape from the immediate crisis?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had numerous experiences with raids.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had raised his level through raids rather than hunting. Therefore, it was safe to say that he was crazy in an emergency.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Furthermore, the bosses of Grid’s raids weren’t monsters that appeared with a “Kuwoooh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Satisfy had named bosses that exerted a big and small influence on the worldview of the game, and they overflowed with individuality.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Perhaps that was why?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had a very unique perspective about bosses.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t just concentrate on the combat patterns of the bosses like everyone else, he also considered their personality and background.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The more he identified the boss’ tendencies, the easier the raid was...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the time of the Pascal raid, Grid hadn’t haphazardly used his strength. The situation was designed to work in his favor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a professional.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would be the first job called ‘raid expert,’ who gave raid advice to various guilds and users.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was a shame that Grid had no brains to turn this talent into money.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Elfin Stone is the key to this situation.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid thought about it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone was able to destroy their party at any time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But in the past four days, he only attempted to kill one of them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was surprisingly simple when looking at his nature.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It was for fun.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone repeated the same thing every time he appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would let them experience extreme fear by killing one person a day.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘His aim is to see us scared and shivering.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What if he focused on killing all of them at once?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It would be futile.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He would lose his toys and Elfin Stone didn’t want that.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have to use this point.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s face darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Rapid Pressure.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">As Grid was thinking, the Overgeared members were struggling.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone’s aggro was thoroughly taken by Huroi, so the party members left Huroi’s protection to Vantner and focused on attacking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members had different characteristics and could create a 120% synergy by connecting their skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were indeed users in the top 20 rankings, and were models for everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In particular, Faker’s performance was dazzling.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was difficult for even Elfin Stone to respond to his swiftness. The dagger caused blood to shed before he could turn his body into smoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, Blood Field was the problem.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone recovered over 1,000 health per second from the Overgeared members!&nbsp;</span><span style="">His recovery power was phenomenal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was estimated that his total health was 8 million.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was impossible to knock him down with the attack power of a few people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Lightning Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwajijijik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas’ fist pierced Elfin Stone’s chest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Elfin Stone didn’t suffer any damage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He turned into smoke at the point of attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is the real thing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas rotated his body without recalling his fist.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He aimed his heel towards Elfin Stone’s head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an irregular and exciting attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kkuk...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas’ strength was his unpredictable attack patterns.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone didn’t expect this type of behavior and groaned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, Pon was rushing forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Rain Spear!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon leapt and repeated stabbed his spear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The spear poured down like rain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an unavoidable attack, as long as the whole body wasn’t turned into smoke.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But if the whole body was turned into smoke, there was a large delay and counter attacking was impossible. It was an act that Elfin Stone had to avoid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Blood Shield!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjeejeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone consumed some of his health to release blood, creating dozens of red shields.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The spears and shields collided in the air.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk!</span></i> <i><span style="">Puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker approached in secret and repeatedly stabbed Elfin Stone in the neck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The higher the number of hits, the more damage that would be accumulated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I’ll have to deal with you first!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker was nervous.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because Elfin Stone’s gaze was no longer focused on Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Iyarugt glowed red, causing his ears to burst.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chiing!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members instantly felt their ears ringing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the ‘Blood Cry’ skill attached to Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members lost their balance and Elfin Stone used a skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Blood Thorns!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puuok!</span></i> <i><span style="">Puuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Dozens of thorns emerged from Blood Field and stabbed Faker’s thigh.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Blood Thorn!&nbsp;</span><span style="">The attack power wasn’t strong, but it was the worst magic that polluted the blood stream of the target.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Movement speed was drastically reduced, so Faker’s swiftness was blocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone smiled and wielded Iyarugt. He wanted to cut Faker’s head off.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Just in time, flaming arrows came flying and stopped the action.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Jishuka’s cover.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You are pretty good humans.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone was stimulated by the Overgeared members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone was in a better position the longer this went on.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone lightly snapped an arrow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His current health was still at 8/10ths.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, the Overgeared members had their health reduced by at least one-third to a half.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the power of Blood Field.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If this continues, we’ll be wiped out in two minutes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zednos restored Faker’s movement speed with Blessing of the Wind, and spoke with a desperate expression.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Vantner shrugged.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I agree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone’s strengths weren’t his attack power, magic power, defense, or speed. These were low compared to bosses of the same level.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the reason he felt so strong was his unrivaled utility.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Wide area status damage, wide area defense and attack skills, wide area vampire skills, single target defense skills and so on.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It seemed impossible unless all the Overgeared members were summoned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Could they win even if Grid reached level 300?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It happened when the party members were feeling doubts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Sacrifice Huroi. The reason why Elfin Stone is on a rampage is Huroi, so he will stop after Huroi dies.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What nonsense was Grid speaking?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Everyone except for Huroi frowned and doubted their ears.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Regas evaded Iyarugt’s fierce attack and questioned Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Selling out our companion? Did I hear it wrong?}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{No, you heard it properly.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon shouted angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Don’t make us disappointed!}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka was the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Grid, a man who sells out his companions doesn’t deserve to stand at the top.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword, Zednos and Faker didn’t give opinions, but they couldn’t hide their uncomfortable feelings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a natural criticism.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid wasn’t ashamed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He looked at all the members with dignified eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is to protect more companions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid wasn’t going to sacrifice Huroi for nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Eight people will be saved by one sacrifice.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ordinary people couldn’t easily make the choice to sacrifice someone for the greater good. Especially if the person was someone precious.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid was more pragmatic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Making decisions out of affection?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid wasn’t the type.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker was hit by an attack.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid ran towards him and pulled out Failure.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The blue Failure collided with the red Iyarugt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The durability of the +9 Failure has decreased by 5.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The strength of the blood stone was far superior to that of the blue orichalcum. Looking at just strength, it seemed to be above adamantium.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The creator of Iyarugt is better than my current self.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid clicked his tongue and sent a whisper to Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Do you understand what I mean?</span></i> <i><span style="">You have to sacrifice yourself for everyone.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi didn’t hesitate at all...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I understand, My Lord.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The reaction was as expected.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This made Grid’s heart ache even more.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid smiled bitterly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Why don’t you ever say it if you don’t like something?</span></i> <i><span style="">I’m even more sorry if you are too good.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I only follow My Lord’s commands.</span></i> <i><span style="">If it’s a reasonable order like right now, I am even more willing!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The loss of experience, item durability loss or item drop penalties after death were fatal to anyone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, Huroi’s combat power was low so his level up speed was slow. Thus, it was more critical.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Nevertheless, Huroi was always willing to follow Grid’s orders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I will surely get revenge on Elfin Stone.</span></i> <i><span style="">And I will make sure that you are compensated enough to make up for today’s sacrifice.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">There is no need for compensation.</span></i> <i><span style="">It is my mission to sacrifice myself for My Lord and your precious people. I desire nothing in return.</span></i> <i><span style="">In addition, this situation is all my fault...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I don’t need you to take responsibility.</span></i> <i><span style="">And don’t forget that you are also a precious person to me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid prepared his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He proposed to Elfin Stone, who was gazing at him coldly over the sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will hand over my companion who dared to mention your parents. Kill him to release your anger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone couldn’t believe his ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Selling out your companion to save your life? Humans are truly dirty and ugly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"So, you don’t want to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A smile appeared on Elfin Stone’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I want.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Indeed.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was as Grid expected.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone waned to enjoy the game of hunting humans for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Go and die."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid commanded as he treated from Elfin Stone, and Huroi took immediate action. He ran over to Elfin Stone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The people who saw him cried out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What are you doing, you crazy guy!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The words were useless.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had already made up his mind, and Huroi followed Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will kill you cruelly.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi didn’t resist as Elfin Stone played with him like a toy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Blood Thorns pierced his ankles to restrict movement, while Iyarugt cut at his wrists so he couldn’t hold a sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the body was sliced up like steak, until he eventually hacked into the head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The physical pain was nothing compared to the mental impact, but Huroi didn’t even groan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His mind had been disciplined by spending hundreds of hours trapped in a dark dungeon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I can’t look anymore!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members were filled with righteous indignation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid warned those who were about to save Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Don’t be ridiculous and get out of here quickly. If you violate this command, I will expel you from the guild.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid lacked charisma.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What did it matter how high his dignity stat was?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He seemed frivolous because he only cared about money and glamor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But at this moment, he was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He felt guilt and sorrow at forcing someone to die.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid tried to keep the emotions from his eyes as he made a strong expression.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The qualities of a leader were slowly blooming.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members calmed down and retreated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On this day, Huroi died.</span></p>
