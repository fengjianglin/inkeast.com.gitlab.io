 <p><span style="">Chapter 305</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No, dammit!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pagma's Descendant could wear all types of equipment items unconditionally.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was one of Pagma’s Descendant’s greatest strengths, and was the source of his destructive power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he couldn’t equip Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because Iyarugt rejected Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">An inferior demonkin?</span></i> <i><span style="">The demonic power that I feel from you is too weak and low quality.</span></i> <i><span style="">You don’t deserve to be my master.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[You are rejected by Iyarugt.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have failed to wear Iyarugt.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If Iyarugt had cursed him, he could’ve cancelled it with his passive immune status.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Iyarugt just didn’t tolerate Grid’s existence itself.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t a matter that could be overcome with status immunity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was baffled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He never imagined that there would be an item he couldn’t wear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s frustrating.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was only one way to increase the rating of a growth item.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Use it a lot.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid couldn’t wear it so he had no way to increase the rating.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid wanted Iyarugt to become a legendary weapon, so he was now in a difficult situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have to increase my demonic power?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Iyarugt rejected Grid because his demonic power was too low. If he increased his demonic power, Iyarugt would no longer reject Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid was unwilling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The higher the demonic power, the more likely I am to go to hell.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Demonic power rising.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It meant he would become a demon sooner.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reason Grid could be sure of this was because of the notification windows he saw when he was in hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The duration of Blackening is over.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your demonic power is sealed and your species has returned to a human being.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[It is impossible for ordinary humans to enter hell. You are expelled from hell.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The system had clearly said so.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was impossible for a human to enter and stay in hell.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In other words, if his demonic power was high enough to allow him entry to hell, he had already become a demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A demon...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If he played a species hostile to humans, would it be possible to progress normally in the game?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It would be tough.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wouldn’t be able to keep his position as lord of Reidan, which meant the collapse of Overgeared. In the worst case scenario, Irene and Khan would leave his side.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid wanted to avoid becoming a demon as much as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘For the time being, I will use Iyarugt only when Blackening is activated.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If he handled it briefly, he would improve his understanding of the item. If it reached 100% understanding...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'At that time, I will use the Legendary Blacksmith’s Reconstruction.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He would change Iyarugt into a soul that obeyed him, making him the perfect master of Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s face distorted in a wicked manner as he pledged.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will change its name to Yakult.'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a 200 won drink that Grid had drank since he was a child, and Iyarugt was hard to pronounce.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a good choice to change the name into something easier to call.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kukukuk...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The demon sword Iyarugt, which had swordsmanship comparable to a great demon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t long until his noble pride would be brutally trampled on.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura joined the party from the 14th city onwards.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was level 203 when she joined.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She might’ve been the former 5th ranked user and a legendary class, but wasn’t her level too low?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The party members judged that Yura joining them was too premature. She would be a burden, rather than help the party.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But she defied everyone’s predictions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The legendary class, Demon Slayer, seemed to be fatal to all demonkin.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura showed off a transcendent combat power against the vampires.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Tatang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Tang tang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A Demon Slayer’s main weapon was a magic gun.&nbsp;</span><span style="">For convenience, a magic gun was a weapon that could only be produced at an alchemy facility and it depended on the user’s control ability.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It required discharging a constant amount of magic power quickly and properly as a bullet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Every attack required a series of steps, so it wasn’t easy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If Grid was given a magic gun to use, he would fail more than 100 times. Maybe it would take him more than three minutes to shoot a bullet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Yura was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She skillfully handled the magic gun based on her masterful control from her time as a black magician, as well as her innate talent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even magic gunmen would admire her skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kiyaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The pure white pistol blended with Yura’s white skin.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Every time she fired a magic bullet, the inferior vampires would shed blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The vampires made disbelieving expressions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A human woman with ebony hair tied up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was so beautiful that she even attracted the vampires who regarded humans as food, and she didn’t have any divine power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yet her abilities were deadly to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Their bodies turned to black smoke, but still received damage. It was an attack that even neutralized the black smoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This woman...! What is your identity?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A vampire shouted when he saw his kin die from the bullets.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The vampires reigned as a top-level predator, but they were now terrified of a human.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Furthermore, a Korean woman!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword’s patriotism rose at the sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Do you know Yura!!!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...That person, it’s obvious that ‘do you know’ are the only English words he speaks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"He doesn’t even know how to use it correctly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The party clicked their tongue at Peak Sword’s tendencies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura just focused on the battle.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The passive skill that was fatal to all demonkin, ‘Purification’ was refined into the magic bullets and then she shot them with ‘Demonkin Contempt.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Tatang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Tang tang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The biggest advantage of a magic gun was the speed of the bullets.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was almost impossible to cope with the bullets, unlike arrows.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The disadvantage was the slow firing speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Unlike the guns of modern society, the magic guns had to undergo the magic refinement process, making the shooting speed very slow. This was a fundamental problem that couldn’t be overcome, even with Yura’s skill.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Click!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura shot at the head of a bullet and was reloading her magic power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Damn human!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The surviving vampires rushed over and wielded their sharp nails at Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner, the only tanker of the party, was protecting Zednos. It was because Zednos used a wide area spell and attracted the aggro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t help Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Someone ran over as Vantner looked shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yura!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The person desperately called out Yura’s name.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was it Grid?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was struggling with Iyarugt while hunting alone. In the first place, he wasn’t paying attention to Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The person rushing to help Yura was Peak Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura was the proud daughter of South Korea, so he couldn’t tolerate her being hurt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m coming! Yura!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword shouted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In fact, Yura didn’t need his help.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A legendary class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In addition, it was a combat focused legendary class.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Supak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura put away her magic gun and pulled out a sword. She used the skill ‘Brilliance Sword’ and swung at the vampires.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The vampires tasted the pain of burning flesh.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword couldn’t help admiring it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You can even use swordsmanship...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A Demon Slayer’s main weapon actually wasn’t a magic gun.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A Demon Slayer possessed the Weapons Mastery skill and could use all types of weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was just that the active skills specialized in the gun and one-handed swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You’re really running wild against the small fry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The intermediate vampires witnessed the junior ones being beaten up by Yura and rushed over.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Panic appeared on Yura’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The junior vampires were in the mid-200s, while the intermediate vampires were at least level 280.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The level difference between them was so large that Yura couldn’t do any damage at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Where are you looking?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka’s voice was heard as Yura looked around for a way to escape the vampires.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka was talking to the vampires.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Your opponent is me!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The arrows revolved like a drill and pierced the hearts of the vampires.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka connected fire arrows with the dancing arrows, causing them to explode.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I didn’t help you. I was just maintaining my experience.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura smiled at the words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I’m happy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Due to her innate talent and beauty, Yura was always alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">People of the same sex were jealous or wanted to borrow money from her, so she never opened up her heart to make friends.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the Overgeared members were different.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were all people with the same talent as Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They didn’t give Yura special treatment or try to keep her in check.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura was able to realize again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was much more rewarding being with someone, rather than being alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is really good that I joined Overgeared.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reason why Yura joined Overgeared was because of Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She wanted to quickly regain her ranking by joining Overgeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was also her personal liking.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was different from ordinary men. He was indifferent to her. Every once in a while, he showed annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This aspect was attractive to Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was she masochistic?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No (perhaps).&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura just felt comfortable with the man who didn’t put pressure on her.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The main point was that Grid’s help in the National Competition was very attractive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the first time she had a crush on someone, so Yura wanted to be near Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, now she liked the Overgeared Guild itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s up to here!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was around two days after Grid’s party started killing the vampires in the 10th city.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The boss appeared in the middle of the city, as windows of a building were shattered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Just like the 14th, 15th, 12th and 11th cities, the boss was a True Blood Baron.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Daring to make a mess in my city! It can’t be forgiven!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Bloody magic power spread in all directions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The surge of magic power was enormous. It was much stronger than a normal dungeon boss.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was nothing compared to Elfin Stone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s party had experience raiding Elfin Stone, so the baron vampires were no threat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Blackening.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid revealed his power from the beginning.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The red sword and dark power coming from him made him look like a grim reaper.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“K-Keok! Why are humans so strong...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The boss of the 10th city scattered into black smoke.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The vampire ring he dropped was distributed among the Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His understanding of Iyarugt was approaching 20%. It was very slow, but it was at least going up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid once again vowed to rename him Yakult and started searching for the pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then he encountered Braham’s soul in the cave with the pavranium.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a reunion after around one and a half years of Satisfy time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Pagma’s Descendant! We finally meet!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Eh?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an unexpected reunion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because Braham’s soul didn’t appear in the 11~15th cities.&nbsp;</span><span style="">To be honest, Grid had almost forgotten about Braham’s existence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Will he be angry?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was stealing the pavranium instead of performing the quest, so Braham would obviously be angry.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid greeted him awkwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I-It has been a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Braham’s response was surprising.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Please help me!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Not only was Braham not angry, he was actually begging.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was different from the personality that Grid knew.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The class quest left abandoned was about to undergo an upheaval.</span></p>
