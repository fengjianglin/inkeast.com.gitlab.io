 <p><span style="">Chapter 228</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Everything on the map seemed to have a smaller scale.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Reidan, marked in the middle of the map, was only the size of a 500 won coin.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘500 won... A large city that can accommodate 430,000 people is only the size of a 500 won coin...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It showed how big the west truly was.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Eternal Kingdom was divided into four regions: the east, west, north and south. However, the size of the four regions wasn’t constant. The west was the largest, followed by the north, east and south.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But this large territory suddenly became a desert.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What if he destroyed the giant worms and restored the west?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was the next in line to the main power in the north of the Eternal Kingdom. He would be able to establish a unique position.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Look here.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rabbit pointed to one side of the map.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the Hebend River that penetrated through Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"As you can see, the villages and cities are concentrated on the southern basin of the Hebend River.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Were there survivors in those places?&nbsp;</span><span style="">But that didn’t matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is the reason?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was surprised by Rabbit’s sudden question.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why are the cities and villages concentrated there? Why is he asking me this? How should I know?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Grid of the past would’ve expressed his disgruntled thoughts.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the current Grid was eager to improve his thinking abilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Umm...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He used his lacking brain to think again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a result, he barely found an answer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Is it because of water?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">People needed water to live.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a simple reason and answer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was wrong.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You’re wrong. Isn’t it also easy to secure water from the north basin? The reason why the population was concentrated on the southern basin in the past was because there was something to attract people there, besides water.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What does that mean?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s the mines. As you can see, there’s a small mountain range, so it’s geographically possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Mines?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was good news.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It didn’t matter if it was iron ore, silver or gold.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Securing any resources, whether large or small, would unconditionally benefit them. It was good news for Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I’m glad to hear it, but why are you suddenly talking about mines? It’s just mines. You can take care of it with Lauel. Right now, I need enhancement stones. How did the conversation switch to this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Indeed... There is this type of response when hearing about the possibility of mines.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit realized it clearly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was different from a common lord.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had little interest in his role as a lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He only devoted himself to working in the smithy for the past four months.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Some people might blame Grid for being irresponsible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Rabbit thought about it positively.&nbsp;</span><span style="">'The duke is right. He might be the best blacksmith and warrior, but he is lacking in knowledge. It’s better for him to stay away from the administration side.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Despite their lack of political power, there were lords who forcefully tried to control their politics.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, Grid chose to rely on competent subordinates because he recognized his own deficiencies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was the ideal lord who knew the limits of what he could do.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He is truly wise and wonderful.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was different from the stupid leader of the Mero Company that Rabbit served in the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit continued the explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">“The Overgeared members have explored the southern basin to see if there really are mines. But there was a strong boss monster, so the Overgeared members abandoned the exploration and classified it as a danger zone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Which of the Overgeared members went?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“All of them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared Guild was strong.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were all rankers in the top 40.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But despite them acting together, there was a boss monster powerful enough to make them retreat?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is it at the level of the complete Hell Gao?’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even Grid wasn’t an opponent for the complete version of Hell Gao. He barely managed to defeat Hell Gao after weakening him by taking two fire stones.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘The current Overgeared members are much stronger...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas was the first member of the Overgeared Guild to obtain his third advancement class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He chose the Asura class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a fighting demon that suited his personality.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Regas went straight to Grid and asked for a duel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was revenge for losing in the finals of the PvP match.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a result, Grid won.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I almost had to use my invincible passive.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a shame, because the duel was after his training period with Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After reaching the third advancement class, Regas was much stronger than before.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the same for the other Overgeared members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there was a boss monster in the west that they couldn’t defeat?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is a terrible place.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid clicked his tongue and prompted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“So? What does that have to do with the enhancement stones?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Did you hear the explanation about why I invested more than half of the guild funds into the alchemy institutes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I heard from Lauel. Isn’t the effect of alchemy amazing? It can make various buff potions, as well as assign special options to items.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There are many other things that alchemy can do. But most cities avoid investing in alchemy. It is to the point that even the richest cities that represent a kingdom are reluctant concerning alchemy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Because it isn’t certain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The effects of items made with alchemy weren’t constant, but often random.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Furthermore, the success rate of alchemy itself was extremely low.&nbsp;</span><span style="">For example, even if the alchemy institute had the highest level, the probability of producing buff potions is less than 70%, and the probability of successfully giving an option to an item was less than 30%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In addition, the prices of the materials needed for alchemy were too high. In conclusion, alchemy was a bad investment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid frowned at the explanation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“What is this? Isn’t it complete rubbish?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">2,937,000 gold out of the five million guild funds had been invested in alchemy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid felt like he had been hit in the back of his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This man is determined to destroy me!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit saw Grid’s expression and explained.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I plan to develop Reidan into the second Talima.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Talima? The dwarf city?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That’s correct.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The dwarf city Talima was called the city of heaven.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Regardless of the rating, it was said that battle gear with a special performance were widely distributed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even a small store would have a solid piece of equipment comparable to a unique-rated item, so many people wanted to go there to purchase battle gear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was impossible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Talima was located within the territory of the dragon Trauka, and was a city that humans couldn’t enter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What if Reidan has items like Talima?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Certainly, the city would be able to show off a unique presence.&nbsp;</span><span style="">People would come from all over the continent to Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rabbit hoped that day would come, so he encouraged the training of blacksmiths and invested in alchemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Alchemy is a way to make the items produced by you and your blacksmiths shine. I am convinced that the only city on the continent worthy of investing in alchemy is Reidan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hrmm..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If it developed the way Rabbit wished, a huge economic effect would be created.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid hoped for that day as well.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Isn’t the success rate of alchemy the worst? Can we afford it? What if we have bad luck and become bankrupt instead of becoming the second Talima?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Do you remember Administrator Arik?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Arik? Ahh, the lord of this place until I was appointed?"&nbsp;</span><span style="">Arik was a funny person.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The episode related to him was a sight to behold.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Isn’t he locked up in prison? What about him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The reason Lauel didn’t kill him was to retrieve information about the west from him. I was also able to gain valuable information from him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What information?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Somewhere in the west, there is a mine for yellow mithril.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yellow mithril?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was Rabbit’s decisive reason for investing in alchemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yellow mithril is the material for fairy dust. And fairy dust is a raw material that dramatically increases the chances of alchemy succeeding. I am guessing that there is a yellow mithril mine in the southern basin of the Hebend River.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a mineral that made it possible to overcome the low success rate of alchemy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was thrilled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The radiant future of Reidan was drawn in his mind and he became excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...By the way, what about the enhancement stones?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was still curious about the topic of conversation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid finally reached the limits of his patience so Rabbit cut to the chase.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Enhancement stones can be made with alchemy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He thought enhancement stones only dropped from boss monsters, so he couldn’t help feeling surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Generally, it is wiser to avoid making enhancement stones because the probability of success is extremely low. But that story will change if we get our hands on fairy dust.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the moment when the reason for Rabbit’s lengthy explanation was revealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“So the conclusion is, please go and secure the mine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid instantly replied.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was no reason to refuse.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The boss monster might be hard for the Overgeared members to raid, but the story would be different if Grid and Noe’s powers were added.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Then I’ll go immediately.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was unstoppable once he made a decision.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He immediately convened the Overgeared members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members were excited to be raiding with Grid after a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It’s the first time since the golem invasion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We’ll be able to knock down that monster if we have Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid looked at the Overgeared members and asked them,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"What type of monster is it? A demonkin?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No, it is a doppelganger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Doppelganger?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A doppelganger was a monster that copied the form and abilities of the target.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were obviously hard to deal with but...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Even if he turns into one of us, we have the advantage in numbers. Can’t you easily defeat it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon explained,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"As you said, the doppelganger is easy to deal with if it turns into one of us. But it’s transforming into someone else who is much stronger than us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner continued.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“It was really incredibly strong. The body is slim and the face is handsome, and he moves quickly while using a sword as big as Dainsleif.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas also spoke.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"The way he moves the greatsword reminds me of you, Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker added.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“The basic moves are similar to Grid, but the sword techniques are several times better than Grid."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hrmm...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The opponent was that great?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was very curious about the power of the doppelganger that the strongest people in the Overgeared Guild were praising.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will soon see.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members finished their preparations.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid commanded,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Depart. Jude, you will protect Reidan along with the soldiers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jude was disappointed that he couldn’t go with them and stepped back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will accompany you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The continent's strongest swordsman.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he was different from before. He was neatly shaved and wearing clean clothes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was hard to imagine that he was a beggar a few months ago, as he was now giving off a strong impression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Please add your strength.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid gladly welcomed Piaro, while the Overgeared members were confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why is he taking a farmer along?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A farmer was useless in a raid. What role did a farmer have in a raid?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Farmers were meant to be in the fields.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel was about to say something, but stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘That reminds me, isn’t Piaro an expert in feng shui?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was Grid planning to use Piaro’s power to secure useful lands?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is surprising. He’s so clever...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel embraced the thought that Grid was growing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid seemed to be a completely different person than before.</span></p>
