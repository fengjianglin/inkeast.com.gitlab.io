 <p><span style="">Chapter 338</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pant... Pant...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He reached his physical limits.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Nevertheless, he was able to hold on for only one reason.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was to hold up the enemies until Marquis Steim received the news of the invasion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Laden struggled to buy some time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But now it was over.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moment he witnessed the 5,000 troops, unbearable despair suppressed Laden’s tired mind and body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Bow to the prince!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chucksley easily overpowered Laden and forced him to kneel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“K-Kuack...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Laden didn’t want to bow his head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The royal family of Eternal? Future king?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No matter what, it was still his lord’s enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Damn bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chucksley pushed down Laden’s head. Due to the pressure on his neck, Laden’s gaze was finally directed towards the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The satisfied Chucksley bowed to the prince.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I greet the prince!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You suffered on the way here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Prince Ren talked to Chucksley before turning his gaze to Laden.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You defeated Beida? You have great skills for your young age. I heard that the northern powerhouse is Phoenix, but that seems to be a story of the past.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Laden didn’t answer. It was enough to incite the wrath of the royal retainers, including Chucksley.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You! You should appreciate the prince’s generosity!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Shut your mouth, it isn’t an honor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Calm down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ren stared at the northern army.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They looked frightened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were accused of opposing the royal family, so only fools wouldn’t realize they would die.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Ren smiled benevolently towards them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You are also people of the Eternal Kingdom and it is right to follow me, successor of the royal family. If you repent and surrender, I will forgive and accept your sin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the end, they were people from the same nation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The prince’s attitude weakened the hearts of the northern troops. They started looking at each other the moment they saw a hole to survive.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At this point, Laden shouted,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“The one who protected us was Marquis Steim, not the king! It is only thanks to the marquis that our northern people can exist, and we have pledged allegiance to him! So I can’t accept your suggestion!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The north was formerly a land of war. The area was filled with the most monsters and barbarians, causing the royal family to give up on it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to that, the northern people were always threatened and felt despair.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The person who led them was Marquis Steim.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wasn’t frustrated, despite the royal family cutting off their support. He had excellent leadership and united the northern people to protect and stabilize his territory.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Marquis Steim was a hero and savior for the northern people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The northern troops recalled this thanks to Laden’s cry and firmed up their hearts. Rather than surrendering, they held their weapons and took an attitude of resistance to the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Everybody is so excited to die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ren’s expression distorted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was unpleasant to miss the opportunity to obtain 1,000 soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He revealed his true nature as he gave an order to Chucksley.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kill those useless dogs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chucksley answered and pointed his sword at Laden’s neck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Laden didn’t feel any regret.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was better to die than to beg for life and betray his master.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Duke Grid, please guard my lord.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kingdom's Hero.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His strength would be able to overcome this ordeal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Laden didn’t doubt it and closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A golden hand glowed under the desert sun.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It flashed through the 5,000 troops and protected Laden.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chucksley’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was absurd.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A golden hand was flying alone and swinging a sword without a master?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t very threatening, but he had to admit that it was fast. He couldn’t understand it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What type of person?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chucksley shouted as he blocked the golden hand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The answer came from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The duke.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a calm and relaxing voice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the middle of a battlefield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chucksley, Prince Ren, the 5,000 royal troops, Laden, and the northern army stared up at the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was a man with black hair.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The man had a small crown on his head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wore harmonious red armor and black boots as he looked down at the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Beggars move around in groups. Foolish.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The man spoke with arrogance on his face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That person was Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A person who rose from a commoner to a duke!&nbsp;</span><span style="">His sudden appearance reversed the atmosphere of the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Duke Grid!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 5,000 royal troops shrank back because of a single man, while the northern army were delighted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a presence beyond common sense.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Fast Boots boasted a wonderful movement speed. Stamina and endurance suffered from a rapid decline, but movement speed increased by up to three times in all terrains.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bunny Bunny ran through the desert and was able to catch up to Prince Ren.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I’m not too late!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bunny Bunny felt relieved and switched his view to camera mode.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Something moved swiftly over his head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At first, he thought it was a huge bird. But then he zoomed in and saw that it was Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It’s natural!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bunny Bunny thought Grid appeared in a dramatic moment to save the northern troops.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had done it countless times in the National Competition and the Reinhardt golem invasion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a hero who made the crowd cheer by appearing at the perfect timing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why did I only realize this now?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Unlike other celebrities in Satisfy, Grid had a lot of anti-fans.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was because he relied on items rather than skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the same with Bunny Bunny.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bunny Bunny didn’t like Grid. He judged that it was difficult to raise the public’s enthusiasm for Grid as the protagonist. In other words, it wasn’t easy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He always watching Grid through sunglasses, but it was different now.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now he belatedly realized.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the first place, items weren’t a factor that could be underestimated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Didn’t Bunny Bunny arrive here quickly because of the Fast Boots?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Items were an indispensable element in the game.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It meant he wasn’t looking at Grid through sunglasses.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bunny Bunny discarded his useless egotism and focused on Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid! Show me the performance of a hero!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His video would make people cheer all over the world.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">[Great Lord’s Sword]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a rare sword only given to the greatest lords and it made it possible to closely observe the target.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Normally this target was only limited to one person. It was difficult to observe several people at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, Grid had a high level of insight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His insight further amplified the power of the Character Observation skill attached to the Great Lord's Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to that, Grid could simultaneously observe the information of the people on the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Instead, the information was very brief.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Name: Chucksley Rokan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level: 313</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Name: Ferrell Shaiva du Bon. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level: 305</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Name: Andu</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level: 301</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">..</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It included the knights of the royal army.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Name: Laden</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level: 258</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">..</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The northern knights.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In addition, there were the royal soldiers and the northern soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid could identify their name and levels. It was impossible to check the details information including stats, skills and stories, but this alone was a big help.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The average level is 130... It is surprisingly high.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The average level of the northern soldiers was 110, while the average level of the royal soldiers was 20 higher.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Given that the Winston soldiers he saw a few months ago weren’t even level 100 yet, the level of the royal soldiers was well above the average.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In other words, they were the elite of the kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘But so what?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t as good as Reidan’s soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The average level of Reidan’s soldiers was 148.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Today they will reach 160!’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ssik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was truly a wily smile. It was enough to make the royal army uneasy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid dismissed the Great Lord's Sword and swapped Braham’s Boots with Grid’s Boots.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The magic Fly is no longer available. Fly is stopped.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You will fall.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s Boots boasted a heavy weight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sand scattered as Grid fell onto the desert sand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“D-Duke Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Laden was baffled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He discarded his favourable position in the sky and fell into the middle of the enemy?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t understand Grid’s judgment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid spoke harshly towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You are really weak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I’ve known you since you started bluffing. You are a braggart who can’t fight properly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid judged Laden using three things.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Firstly, it was the first time they met.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Laden said there was a rodent hiding in Irene’s bedroom. But the result? There wasn’t even a fly, let alone a rodent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The second was his level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The level of the royal knights was at least 300, while Laden was only level 258. It meant that while everyone was hunting hard, Laden was playing alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The third thing was results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The royal knights and soldiers were fine, while Laden and the northern army were dying. No matter how great the number, this one-sided result proved that he was powerless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Tsk tsk... I don’t understand why Father-in-law appreciates you so much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Laden’s heart was stabbed as he heard the words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The duke’s words are true. I am too weak and useless.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Laden fell into shame. He felt guilty to his lord.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Meanwhile, the royal army was astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He got rid of Beida and the Iron Wind.'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He is strong enough to defend against Chucksley’s sword many times.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Yet he is weak?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s measure of strength seemed to be much different from theirs.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Indeed, it was natural.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was the kingdom’s hero.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He already showed overwhelming strength in the golem invasion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They couldn’t be compared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The 5,000 army shrank back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Plunging into enemy territory alone, you don’t understand the situation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chucksley pointed his sword at Grid. His momentum was great.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Great Swordsman.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had the title of one of the continent’s strongest swordsman, so he didn’t shrink back despite the opponent being Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“During the Reinhardt invasion, I was somewhat lacking. I could only watch you from a distance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Since then, I have made an effort to become stronger than before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chucksley wielded his sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a straight trajectory with no flaws. It truly was a sleek and sophisticated blow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bunny Bunny exclaimed as he filmed the scene from a considerable distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Too fast!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an unavoidable attack.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The problem was that Grid gave the enemy an opportunity.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bunny Bunny was sure that Grid would be hit first.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A blood sword emerged from a dark space in front of him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t a greatsword that Grid normally used, so his attack speed surpassed that of Chucksley.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Fast!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was so fast that it couldn’t be seen!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid scoffed at Chucksley, whose attack was blocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Are you a fool? Do you think that I was playing around while you became stronger? I have grown stronger, just like you. You won’t catch up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Won’t catch up?” (TL: Grid uses an Internet slang that basically means someone who can’t catch up)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What did that mean?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s onslaught poured towards the puzzled Chucksley.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The repetitive use, disassembly and assembly process led to a 100% understanding, and Iyarugt was now going to turn the battlefield into disarray.</span></p>
