 <p><span style="">Chapter 335</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Swaeek!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The aura whip aimed at the farmers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The farmers standing here were Piaro and Royman.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘How can aura have this form?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Royman was familiar with aura.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her father was a prominent swordsman and able to skillfully use aura.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But this was the first time she had seen such a changeable aura. It was released from the sword? This wasn’t aura, but magic!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There are many masters in this world!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Royman accepted Hurent as a master of a new world. She felt awe.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The aura blade aimed for her neck as she stared blankly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro tsked and blocked it with a hand plow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Not reacting when a blade is coming at your neck, it’s a convenient way to commit suicide.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I-I’m really sorry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Royman was confused.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That amazing aura was blocked by a hand plow?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I knew Sir Piaro was strong, but this much?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Royman expected Piaro to have the strength of an ordinary knight. It was natural since he did field work every day. He didn’t look very special.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But not now. Perhaps Piaro’s strength was higher than Asmophel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will teach you to reflexively defend, even if you don’t have two arms. Let’s plant rice for three hours every day starting from tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She was sincerely grateful for her life being spared. He would be her savior for the rest of her life.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But planting rice?&nbsp;</span><span style="">This wasn’t a penalty game, so Royman couldn’t understand what was going on.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, Piaro was somewhat confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is there another strong person?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Red Knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro carried out wars all over the continent when he was a part of them. He spent more days falling asleep on the battlefield than he did at home, and he had to face countless enemies. He saw the powerhouses that represented each nation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, the enemies he met while staying at this peaceful(?) Reidan were much more brilliant. &nbsp;It was truly amazing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Reidan entices powerhouses.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Or maybe it was just a different time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In any case, Piaro enjoyed it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The invasion of enemies would be the food that further strengthened the legendary farmer’s power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was caught up in this positive feeling and told Hurent what he thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Your ability to control aura is amazing. But it’s still lacking strength.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A farmer praising an aura master’s aura, Hurent couldn’t be happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘However, his skills are real.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The dirt-covered farmer had blocked his aura with a hand plow. It wasn’t a dream. The 2,000 soldiers all saw it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The rumors were true?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He heard that there were powerful farmers in Reidan. There were rumors that the reason the seven guilds failed was due to farmers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Of course, I thought it was nonsense.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now it seemed to be true.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hrmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent turned towards Bunny Bunny.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bunny Bunny had the camera in hand and was filming the situation. From his excited expression, he also seemed to be aware of the rumors about Reidan’s farmers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I don’t need to take risks before meeting Grid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was confident about getting revenge on Grid, so he couldn’t fall victim to this farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent judged and turned towards Royman.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Use him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent’s judgment and execution were excellent. There were no unnecessary delays.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In order to increase his concentration, he closed his eyes and used ‘Aura Impact.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have released your aura.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Accurately imagine the shape of the aura within 2 seconds. If there is even a small error in the image, the skill will fail.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had been practicing image training every day for the past 10 months in order to bring out the true power of an aura master!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent’s eyes flashed and he shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dragon’s Roar!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have developed the breath of a dragon! By reproducing the power of a transcendent being, the power of your aura is greatly increased!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[There is a limit to the power that a unique rated aura can exert.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuwaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The aura fired by Hurent blew out in a straight line. The strong energy that stirred the earth and caused a sand storm couldn’t be compared to the whip from before.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro was sincerely amazed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">When he was a great swordsman, he realized the limits of aura. However, the man in front of him was different. He broke through the limits of aura.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a truly respectable person who achieved a level that Piaro couldn’t reach.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"In honor of your talent, I will also use my full power.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro couldn’t afford to relax. To be precise, he had no room to spare.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had to protect Royman, who would grow to be a strength for his lord.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The power of the aura breath was strong and wide. He couldn’t just stand by and watch.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Free Farming 4th Style.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Suruk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro moved his hand to his waist. It was to extract a plow from one of the six sheaths hanging there.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A plow that Grid created.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As soon as he pulled it out, Piaro’s power exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The power of items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[All skills related to farming will increase by 20%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Plow the Field!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s plow struck the ground, causing it to rise like a tsunami.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Amazing!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The world’s top gaming BJ, Bunny Bunny.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He pointed his camera and admired the whip-like aura.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent’s control skills were extraordinary.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Bunny Bunny was disappointed when the shabby farmer blocked it with a hand plow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A farmer could block that skill?'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Aura Master Hurent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His aura was gorgeous, but it was without strength. There was a reason he was defeated by Grid in 5 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Instead of getting revenge on Grid, will he die in four seconds this time?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bunny Bunny was extremely disappointed in Hurent when he suddenly had a thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I heard a rumor that there was a monster famer in Reidan...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was the rumor true?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A huge scoop!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was a great opportunity to inform the world about the truth of the rumors.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The excited Bunny Bunny focused on filming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent used a tremendous skill that was reminiscent of a dragon’s breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Ohhh!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent’s abilities were real. It was too early to be disappointed in him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bunny Bunny started sweating as he saw the power of that breath.&nbsp;</span><span style="">How would the rumored farmer cope with this cool technique?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Increase my viewership with a spectacular battle scene!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bunny Bunny prayed, but his wish was soon popped.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Another farming equipment?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The hand plow changed to a plow!&nbsp;</span><span style="">The farmer called Piaro didn’t seem to be showing a brilliant battle scene, unlike Bunny Bunny’s expectations.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, Bunny Bunny was crazy to have high expectations in the first place.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bunny Bunny frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Free Farming 4th Style, Plowing the Field.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The earth rose and collided with Hurent’s aura breath.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At the same time, the ground started to be cleared for use as a farming field.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bunny Bunny’s camera picked up the stunning sight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Streams of water were rising from the center of the cleared land.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is the desert!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Water was found in the desert?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bunny Bunny’s cognitive abilities failed to keep up with the scene in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Free Farming 1st Style, Sowing.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Papat!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pa pa pa pa pak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Seeds poured down like rain over the confused Bunny Bunny and 2,000 soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'What is this?'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a series of processes that reminded him of farming.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No, this is impossible.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No one was crazy enough to start farming in front of 2,000 enemies...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Free Farming 2nd Style, Rapid Growth.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaduk!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kudududuk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Heok!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bunny Bunny’s face turned white.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because the thousands of seeds scattered on the ground started to sprout all at once.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is crazy!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He wanted a spectacular battle scene, but it was a farming diary?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bunny Bunny felt more anger than wonder as he stared at the scene of a desert being turned into rice fields.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At this time, Hurent was aiming for Royman.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">[Block Toys to Help a Child’s Development.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an item Grid got from the Reputation Store.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At first he thought it was a useless item, but he was glad to see Lord playing well with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Abu. Abu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A small baby was sitting on the bed and building a spire with the blocks. It was a crude shape that anyone could recognize as a castle.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A child only 10 days old was building a castle with blocks? It was an unbelievable sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A genius! The best genius of the continent!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Marquis Steim was sure of it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an objective assessment, not because he was blinded by love.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Irene made a happy expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s good that his dexterity resembles my husband’s. I think he will become a master of blacksmithing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid replied with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"He’s just like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Dear husband...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Irene.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The eyes of the couple were filled with affection. The couple’s love was much deeper than before.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Every night, the six hands...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Omitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">So it was natural that their love would deepen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hum hum.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Marquis Steim coughed as the coupled embraced each other. It was a signal that they shouldn’t forget he was here.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What type of education are you planning on focusing on for Lord?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Marquis Steim’s question activated the child care system.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Please select Lord’s education.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Lord’s age is still young, so there are limited options to choose from.]</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <ol>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style=""> Leave it until he is older.</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style=""> Basic academic education.</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style=""> Basic etiquette education.</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ol>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">'Don’t rush.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What education should he give to a child who was only 10 days old?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was able to pick option one when he suddenly stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No, if I think about it, isn’t the current Lord twice as intelligent as Jude?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jude’s maximum intelligence was set at 20, while Lord was born with 48 intelligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was young, but had a good brain, so he was already at a level that could be taught.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That’s why basic academics and etiquette were provided in the options.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He is highly likely to become arrogant.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid pondered and made a decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will teach him etiquette. He was born with a gold spoon, but he shouldn’t be too indulged.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Um, yes. Early education is important. It’s especially important for talented children.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m in favor of Dear Husband’s will.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Lord’s early education method has been selected. Your wife Irene will teach Lord.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Eh?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid could see Lord’s face, which had been smiling happily the whole time. Now Lord looked like he wanted to complain about something.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Don’t tell me he doesn’t want to study?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Did he understand their words?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I must be mistaken.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was being too sensitive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid laughed it off.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"There’s a strange expression on Lord’s face, so it seems like he has done a poo.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oh my, really?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Irene confirmed it and called a maid.</span></p>
