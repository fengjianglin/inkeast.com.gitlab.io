 <p><span style="">Chapter 193</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">It was around one year and eight months ago in reality.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Satisfy’s service launched with the interest of the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Since that day, Euphemina had been playing Satisfy for more than 14 hours everyday, without taking a single day off.&nbsp;</span><span style="">19 years old, 20 years old, the precious time of her youth was spent in a game.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Some would say that her youth was wasted. These youthful days would never come back.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They didn’t know.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina didn’t have any regrets.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Satisfy was a more joyful and precious world for her, who was always alone in her own home environment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">And today.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In this precious world, it was the first time that Euphemina met an object of longing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That person was Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He can produce legendary items...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina had killed countless monsters and raided bosses, eventually reaching level 283. She cleared hundreds of quests.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Nevertheless, the maximum rating of items she acquired was a unique rating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Legendary items? She never even saw it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She thought legendary items were something that only existed in fantasies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, she never imagined that Grid would make a legendary rated orb. She just wanted Grid to make a unique rated orb.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, Grid made a legendary rated orb.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The result was truly amazing. To be honest, she couldn’t really believe it. It felt like a dream.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was like a halo was coming from Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was blinded by him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid, you are the god in my heart from this moment on.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina was ecstatic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel whispered to her,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“If you become Grid’s subordinate, you will be able to get more magnificent items like this orb.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the temptation of the devil. It was impossible for her to refuse.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina became Grid’s subordinate.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“You can use this room in the future. You will normally have freedom, and only have to follow Grid when there is a specific mission.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I understand."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Then I will be going. Huroi and I have to accompany Grid to Bairan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Winston Castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina received a place to stay.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a moderately large room. When she opened the window, she saw a beautiful garden and a wide sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But most of all, it was close to Grid’s bedroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hihit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She couldn’t help laughing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She had been playing Satisfy for a long time, but it was the first time she felt excited to gain colleagues. She was happy because she could see the glorious Grid every day.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was very excited about the adventures she would experience with Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"First of all, I need to permanently store a spell on my orb.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to Grid making a legendary orb, she could give the orb an S-grade spell.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina called up her skills list.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The S-grade magic that she duplicated and stored were classified separately.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Demon King’s Tail Lv. 2]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It can burn up to 16 people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It will deal 2,509 fixed fire damage per second for up to 4 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Range: 10m radius</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Mana Cost: 3,200</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 15 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Fluid Escape Lv. 1]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soul and body of the caster will be separated for 3 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The caster can control the soul that emerged from the body, while the body will be immune to all damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soul can deal 1,030 + (half of the caster’s current magic power) damage to all targets in the way.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As soon as the soul returns to the body, a shockwave will be generated, pushing all nearby enemies back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Mana consumption: 65% of your current mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 1 hour.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Storm Gravity Field Lv. 1]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Installs a gravity field 5m in diameter at the specified location. It will take 1.2 seconds to install and all objects trapped in the gravity field will be suppressed for 2 seconds. After that, the raging storm will deal 8,600~15,900 damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Range: 20m radius</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Mana Cost: 2,500</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 18 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Carshian’s Fury Lv. 2]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Shields the caster with a fire shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The shield absorbs a total of 15,000 damage and will return half of the absorbed damage back to the opponent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Physical defense and magic resistance will increase by 20%, and fire resistance by 99% while the shield is active.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Mana Cost: 3,000</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 20 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In order to acquire S-grade magic, a user had to be at least level 280 and meet other difficult conditions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the first place, S-grade spellbooks were rare.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Looking at the users and NPCs, there were only a few who had acquired S-grade magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Therefore, Euphemina couldn’t duplicate a lot of S-grade magic. Her choices were narrow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Nevertheless, she wasn’t disappointed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reason was simple.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because of Fluid Escape, a fraudulent magic that had the most usefulness among her S-grade spells.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a rare spell that dealt damage proportional to magic power and made the body invincible.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Learning this spell was the standards of a great magician.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the past, Euphemina followed Earl Ashur for a month before barely managing to duplicate it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She cherished it so much that she didn’t even use it when her life was in danger, so she permanently stored it in the orb without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Do you want to attribute the spell ‘Fluid Escape’ to the Indecisive Mumud’s Orb?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The spell can’t be released when attached to an item. Do you still want to progress?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The blue orb shone brightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The skill ‘Fluid Escape’ has been removed from the Duplicator’s skills list.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[’Fluid Escape’ now belongs to the Indecisive Mumud’s Orb.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Bururu.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina’s small body shook as she confirmed the result.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was due to the thrill she felt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her cheeks flushed and she stroked the orb with a joyful expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Beautiful. This is too good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At this moment, she finally realized that she was the owner of such a great item.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She tried to equip the orb in order to fully realize it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have equipped the Indecisive Mumud’s Orb.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The normal notification window appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your position has been revealed to someone. You won’t be able to escape from the eyes of surveillance.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then an unknown notification window popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What does that mean?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina was stunned as she blinked her large eyes. Then she nodded as if she understood.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"My position is being delivered to Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The orb’s maker was Grid, so it made sense to think so.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a legendary item. It wouldn’t be strange to have specific features built into it, so she didn’t think about it any longer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She rushed in front of the mirror and admired the beautiful sight of her holding the blue orb.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But what was the truth?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The eyes of surveillance on her wasn’t from Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At the same time, in one of the 27 golem labyrinths throughout the continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[I finally found it.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The voice off the great magician Braham rang out through the labyrinth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He issued a command to thousands of golems.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Show the fool who dared to ignore the great me.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuuong!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kuuong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">All types of powerful golems moved in unison. They were slowly but surely heading to the same destination.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Soon after, this spectacular scene was captured by users across the world and would once again bring a big wave to Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bairan Castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid visited with some shocking words.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Tzedakah Guild gathered in the meeting room didn’t welcome it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Are you serious about withdrawing from the guild?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Toban asked again and Grid nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why all of a sudden?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">The one who asked was Overgeared No. 2, Ibellin. He was looking at Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“What did that guy say to mislead Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As one of the 10 Rookies, Ibellin had a fierce rivalry with Lauel. So he growled every time they met, but Lauel never gave him a second thought.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But this time was an exception. Lauel replied to Ibellin.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ibellin. Are you saying that Grid is an idiot who would be swayed by my words?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Twitch.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi’s eyes narrowed from where he was silently standing behind Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Ibellin was baffled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What...? What did you leap to that conclusion? That isn’t what I meant!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Quiet."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka finally came forward.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her folded arms highlighted her big chest as she stared intently at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why do you want to leave?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I want to become a lord.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid answered simply.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka asked him again,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You're asking why?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid made the shape of a coin with his fingers and spoke bluntly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Because of money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now they understood everything.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Certainly, the amount of taxes collected from Bairan after being promoted to a city was so big that it couldn’t be ignored.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was natural to feel greedy. Especially for Grid, who was only playing the game for money.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Can’t you be a lord even if you belong to the guild?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka didn’t want Grid to leave. Putting aside her personal feelings, she didn’t want to lose one of the factors that made the guild strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Well...that...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid tried to explain but it wasn’t easy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then Lauel came out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“In order to become a lord, a certain position is required. It isn’t enough to be a viscount. Grid is only a member of the guild, but he also has a lot of subordinates. Therefore, he can’t be left as a guild member of the Tzedakah Guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That’s what I was trying to say.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The eyes of the Tzedakah Guild members were cold as they looked at Laeul.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They didn’t like that he was encouraging Grid to cut ties with his close companions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Based on this situation, Lauel seemed to be trying to separate them from Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Only Faker was watching Lauel with a happy expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Indeed... he fills everything that Grid is lacking.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was really great.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The other guild members were jealous of being deprived of Grid and didn’t recognize him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Faker knew that someday the guild members would recognize Lauel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka explained,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Grid, if it is just money then, I will give you the taxes from Bairan. So why don’t we stay like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The taxes from Bairan were shared fairly between the guild members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now she would ignore the other guild members and give the taxes to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a truly shocking offer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The other members expressed no dissatisfaction, despite Jishuka deciding it on her own. It was because Grid was worth more.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They already made a lot of money due to betting on Grid in the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, Lauel wanted to curse.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He thought that Grid would accept Jishuka’s proposal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid’s response was surprising.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I don’t want to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Didn’t Grid want money?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hadn’t he suffered from hair loss due to the money problems recently? Then why did he so easily refuse?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was so surprising that even Huroi and Lauel shook.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Everyone was confused by Grid’s shocking remark.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I can’t be satisfied with just the taxes of one city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bairan achieved an incredible growth after the National Competition and was now called the third largest city in the north.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yet this city wasn’t enough for him?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid, perhaps you...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was looking higher.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka’s eyes widened as she realized this fact, while Grid declared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The minimum of what I want is a territory the size of Winston. That is the starting point."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi and Lauel asked him to be king.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would grasp it first before the two billion users of Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t resist.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a chance to become the richest man on Earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Jishuka, take the kids and come under me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh...!”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka burst out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wanted to swallow the elites who were in the top 100 of the unified rankings at all once?&nbsp;</span><span style="">"A complete thief.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was no saying more accurate than that.</span></p>
