 <p><span style="">Chapter 421</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s shocking strength and bravery were backed by his items. It was enough to qualify as a tiger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was relatively easy to avoid the combo of Transcended Link and Linked Kill Wave, but even Russia was forced to shrink back from the power of the items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Alexander was overwhelmed... I didn’t know that the power of items was this much.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It isn’t a match for Kraugel, but it can be compared to Night.&nbsp;’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There’s a limit on what the three of us can do.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Night.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Night, an unofficial ranker who destroyed Alexander at the PvP competition held by the Russian government.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was so strong that they were reminded of Night’s strength.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Russian representatives shuddered, while the third advancement users thought quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The two second advancement classes failed to escape from Grid’s Transcended Link and fell down the mountain.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Those two are weak. If we’re killed by Grid, it’s impossible to win with just Kraugel and those two.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘We should compromise here.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Step, step.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was approaching.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If they didn’t want to experience a catastrophe, they needed to make a quick decision.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Russia representatives made a suggestion to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"How about making an alliance?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Haven’t you suffered a big loss of power? We won’t fight until the end, instead we will help each other out with other countries. Won’t we be invincible if we join forces?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Let’s share the gold and silver medal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Russians thought that Grid would willingly accept the proposal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Currently, the only survivors of the Korean team were Grid, Yura, and Peak Sword. It was also clear that Yura and Peak Sword would soon be logged out by Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid would be left alone.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid will stubbornly fight.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'It’s the end for South Korea if Grid dies.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If Grid isn’t a fool, he won’t fight us until the end.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Russian representatives were sure of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What if I don’t want to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid showed an unexpected reaction.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was he stupid?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had steadily developed in the past year. It wasn’t just his power, but his thinking abilities as well.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was always aware of Lauel’s advice and grasped the battlefield more accurately.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The moment we ally with each other, it’s likely that the other counties busy fighting each other will become alert towards us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The countries currently alive were powerful. It wouldn’t be good if they worked together in a pincer attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let’s make it simple. I will kill you here as originally planned.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Russians thought it was absurd.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They hurriedly tried to persuade him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Think about it calmly! It’s better to combine strengths rather than fighting and destroying both of us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Destroying?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid asked like he didn’t understand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I will be destroyed by you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Russian representatives frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is with this reaction? Don’t tell me you believe that you can easily beat the three of us alone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It doesn’t seem that hard?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid shrugged as he held Grid’s Greatsword + Failure, which only had a short duration remaining.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s Greatsword and Failure were both weapons with a legendary rating.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Once they were joined together through Item Combination, their power exceeded the ‘sealed’ myth rated weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a weapon that couldn’t be understood using the common sense of current users.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What happened if the Rune of Darkness effect was added to the Blacksmith’s Rage buff skill?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It would make the 50% drop in PvP damage pointless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Opening the Rune of Darkness. Demonic power has permanently increased by 10. * For one minute, 20% addition shadow damage will be added to normal attacks and skills.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Blacksmith's Rage has been used. Attack power will increase by 25% and attack speed will increase by 40% for 35 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid rushed towards the Russian representatives.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Russians clicked their tongues at his ridiculous judgment and threw their weapons to weaken Grid’s power.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Teteteteng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Their eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid surrounded his body with the black cloak and the weapons thrown at it were stuck or bounced back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{W-What? Did you see that? What in the world is that cloak?}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{I’ve seen several legendary cloaks, but nothing like this...}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Don’t make a big fuss. Stay calm.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Indeed, it was funny to be surprised at items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From the very beginning, Grid was the king of being overgeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{No matter how great his items are, he’ll have definite limits.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s control skills were at the level of the low level rankers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Aim at this point.}</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">As soon as Grid got within a certain distance, the representatives of Russia formed a triangle shape with Grid in the center, isolating him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They linked skills that made use of the strengths of their different weapons, disturbing Grid and dealing constant damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t that Grid didn’t know their intentions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His intense combat experience amplified Grid’s judgement ability in a positive direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid moved naturally while using Pagma’s Swordsmanship, avoiding the Russian rankers’ non-targeted skills. This made the Russians feel astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Avoidance skills?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They didn’t know.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Over the past year, how hard Grid had been working to defeat stronger enemies and how much he developed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Grid gave them despair.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Restraint.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A wide area CC was activated in an instant, causing the Russians to look contemplative.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid swapped from Braham’s Boots to Grid’s Boots to raise the destructive power even more, and dealt a blow to them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At this moment, commentators, experts and viewers around the world were thrilled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Pagma’s Swordsmanship, it had an obvious weakness! The footwork is needed to use it. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 In fact, in last year’s National Competition, Grid was hit by a few rankers using this weakness. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 But this year's Grid is different! He uses the skill while moving! Grid has learned how to avoid this weak point! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Overcoming weaknesses and sublimating weapons...! It’s really amazing! Really great! Grid is actually a genius! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was more than two years since Grid was exposed to the world.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t a short amount of time, and at last, the world started to see Grid’s true value.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A true top class.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A monster was hiding on this small island.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Chinese representatives were upset.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They ignored Japan as a small country.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yet Katz’ strength was incredible. It was more than they predicted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Meanwhile, Damian was also very surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He’s above the average level of Overgeared.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Genius at fighting’ Hao.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The best person in China, whose population was over 1.3 billion, his strength was unrivalled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, he had excellent control skill over secondary weapons like chains.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian thought that Hao was equal to the top members of Overgeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yet the more surprising thing...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Katz is the same as Hao.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Blood Breath!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dragon Fear!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was like a Hollywood blockbuster movie.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As the magnificent and destructive confrontation between Hao and Katz deepened, the environment became worse.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian used a wide range protection spell so that his teammates wouldn’t be hurt by the damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What will be the outcome?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Chinese representatives stood arrogantly, believing only in Hao’s strength.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, the Japanese were nervous that Katz would be defeated by Hao.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, Japan couldn’t wait any longer and moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Don’t fight head on. Retreat and fight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">China boasted the best power in Asia and their average level was higher than Japan by 15. There were three third advancement classes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moment that Yoshimura and the Japanese representatives were being pushed back by the momentum of the Chinese representatives.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don't run away and fight. Divine Protection, Incarnation of Light, Goddess’ Blessing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damain used various buff skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Divine Protection increases the defense of you and your party by 20% for 3 minutes.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Light Incarnation increases the attack power of you and your party by 10% for 3 minutes.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Goddess’ Blessing increases you and your party members’ stats by 10% for 5 minutes, negates one strike and will create a shield that absorbs 8,000 damage.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The effect was comparable to the buffs used by priests.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, the effects of Goddess’ Protection was beyond imagination, causing the Japanese rankers to feel shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Katz was also impressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He isn’t the pope for nothing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Blood Warrior had a passive blood-sucking effect, so his battle endurance was very good.&nbsp;</span><span style="">With Damian’s buffs and healings, Katz would be able to hunt infinitely.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Katz decided that he would surely turn Damian into his own person after the National Competition ended. He didn’t doubt it, because he believed in his wealth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao groaned because he couldn’t adjust to Katz’ rise in stats.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It happened when Katz smiled triumphantly and was going to link a combo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Shed Weapon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao showed wonderful control through a different skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He accurately grasped the orbit and speed of Katz’ sword, grabbed it and dropped Katz’ weapon to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your weapon ‘Crave’ has been released!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[This is the result of a skill. You won’t lose ownership of the item. In 12 seconds, the item will return to your inventory.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘My weapon was forcefully removed?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If he couldn’t pick up the sword that fell to the ground, he wouldn’t have a weapon for 12 seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hao hit Katz’ chest and shoulders and used another skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Shed Armor!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">“Shit!”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Once his armor was caught in Hao’s hands, Katz cursed as he felt the worst result.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Hao’s sword tore through the single piece of cloth and pierced his abdomen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cough...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s up to here.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao wanted to finish Katz off completely.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he was worried about Damian’s intervention. While Katz was flinching, Hao stepped back and examined the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hiik!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Most of the screams came from the Chinese representatives.&nbsp;</span><span style="">China was completely shaken by Japan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Pope...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Along with the fraudulent buffs, Damian occasionally used offensive magic and healing magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was showing off the ridiculous abilities of the first pope user, standing there with a laidback expression, like an old man who was drinking alcohol.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Japan is a strong team this year.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were also a candidate to win.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Japan felt stronger than any country that Grid and the Overgeared members belonged to. It was almost like Russia or the United States.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thus, Hao had a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why? If you have this much power, why aren’t you absorbed in the target processing? Why abandon getting a medal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian responded like it was obvious.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Isn’t Grid participating in this? Rather than losing and lowering the morale of the team, it’s better to give up on this event.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao had no direct experience with Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He’d only witnessed Grid’s videos in the past, so he couldn’t understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel and Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why did people who he acknowledged keep overestimating Grid?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The puzzled Hao became shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The only object of his awe, the score of the Russian team that Kraugel belonged to, completely stopped, while Korea’s score started to rapidly accelerate.</span></p>
