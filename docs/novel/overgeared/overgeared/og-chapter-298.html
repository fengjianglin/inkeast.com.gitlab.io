 <p><span style="">Chapter 298</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is the ability of a human?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone had existed for over 350 years.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Over the years, he’d met countless humans. Among them were genii as well as those called warriors.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But in the end, they were inferior.&nbsp;</span><span style="">For Elfin Stone, humans were just prey to be hunted and eaten.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But his perception changed at this moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Extreme Blood Transfusion, that couldn’t be seen with the naked eye, was blocked by a sword?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was outstanding. This person wasn’t inferior.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone’s face twisted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is like Braham said.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham, the first one to give him anger and pain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Braham did all types of bad things and was eventually banished.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Do you fail to understand my inquiring mind even until the end? Brethren, you are worse than humans. The humans you regard as livestock aren’t lazy. They are different from us, they are always working and developing. One day a transcendent entity will emerge that will threaten us, and it will be a human.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘That damn bastard...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham Eshwald, who studied human magic and vampire magic, sacrificing countless vampires in the process.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Some of Elfin Stone’s blood relatives were the lab rats, including his lover, Leah.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk... Kukuk...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How hard had he worked over the past hundreds of years?&nbsp;</span><span style="">In order to forget the terrible memories, Elfin Stone slept more and hunted to clear the wounds in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Meeting these humans stirred up his memories again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It makes me think of Braham’s disgusting face.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He couldn’t forgive Braham.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone’s eyes were full of hate as he glared at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Your skills are decent, but in the end, you’re just a human! You are my prey!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puhahahak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone’s blood gathered into a sphere.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It shot towards Grid and caused a powerful explosion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the manifestation then explosion of blood.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Its power was far above those of the continent’s 10 great magicians.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can’t avoid it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The blast range was too big.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had no choice but to defend. However, he wondered if he could completely absorb the damage with the Divine Shield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moment Grid was about to take out the Divine Shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will protect the leader!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner embraced Grid and used ‘Thousand Shields,’ a skill that greatly reduced the power of magic, thereby reducing the power of Blood Explosion.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuak! I’m dead!” </span></p>
 <p><span style="">Even Thousand Shields couldn’t completely suppress the force of Blood Explosion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thousand Shields was destroyed by the explosion and Vantner suffered severe injuries from the contaminated blood scattered by the explosion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid raised his thumb from within Vantner’s arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Thank you. Although it isn’t a great feeling to be in a man’s arms.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kukuk! I’m not doing this because I like it! Now go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner shouted with a laugh.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The new version of Grid had already shot forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone saw that Grid was fine and furiously fired Blood Missiles.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The blood-guided missiles chased Grid and tried to block his approach.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s hard to shake off.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The missiles were fast and relentless.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Avoidance and interception was impossible. He couldn’t protect his body with just Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'It can't be helped.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid started his footwork.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He planned to use Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Wave, to shoot down the missiles.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But at the moment, dozens of flaming arrows appeared from the rear.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was amazing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They shot down all the missiles aiming at Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was only one person in Satisfy with such bow skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Expert archer Jishuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Leave the cover to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka winked with a bright appearance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s heart thumped as he kept moving forward. He narrowed the distance to Elfin Stone and declared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuwooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Isn’t this crazy?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The two greatswords that came flying at Elfin Stone!&nbsp;</span><span style="">The dimension of the swordsmanship was different than before.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone used Fly and tried to avoid it in the air.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he couldn’t fly because a strong wind pressure pushed down on his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the influence of Zednos’ Storm of Eternity.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The original Storm of Eternity was a magic that completely restrained the target. However, Elfin Stone’s magic resistance was so high that only some of his movements could be limited.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Of course, that alone was a great help to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid realized.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yes, now he wasn’t alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He could count on the people with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Now I...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was stronger than ever!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puoook!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk...! Kuaaaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The two greatswords penetrated Elfin Stone’s chest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was enough to drive him crazy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid alone was enough to make Elfin Stone feel alert, but the humans supporting Grid meant the battle was developing in an unexpected way.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It would’ve been different if Blood Field was deployed, but there was still 3 minutes left of the cooldown time. It was the worst situation caused by his failure to use the skill before.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will kill all of you in this place!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Today would be different from yesterday. There were no negotiations.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Using the blood from his chest as a medium, he blew Grid away with an explosion and called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Iyarugt!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kiiing-</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the advent of the red longsword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moment that ‘Blood Cry’ cause the Overgeared members to lose their sense of balance...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Now!'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid would also be affected by Blood Cry!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone smiled and wielded Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The red line crossed Grid’s stumbling body...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone was confused.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid defended against his sword?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Who the hell are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid wasn’t affected by his evil influence and he wasn’t disturbed by Iyarugt’s Blood Cry?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was this really a human?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid confirmed Elfin Stone’s shaken eyes and replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Who will kill who?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid scoffed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His gaze was focused behind Elfin Stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Ah!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone hurriedly moved his sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was too late.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The Price of Living.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk!</span></i> <i><span style="">Puk puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker’s silver dagger pierced Elfin Stone’s neck again and again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Price of Living.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a skill that did more damage according to the number of strikes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yesterday, Elfin Stone had only allowed three strikes, but today was the worst. He actually allowed seven hits.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was due to Grid perfectly catching the aggro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuock... You rat bastards!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone’s health gauge naturally decreased as Iyarugt aimed at Faker.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The aggro was changed to him due to the Price of Living.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In a normal raid, drawing aggro could endanger the part. But this situation was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because Grid originally had more utility as a damage dealer than as a tanker.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Pinnacle!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Pinnacle was used.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone paid a heavy price for looking away from Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 210,900 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Not enough.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s expression became dark.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was because 5 Joint Attacks wasn’t activated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone’s current health was at 80%.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the result of being hit by Extreme Blood Transfusion, Kill, Price of Living and Pinnacle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone’s health and defense was outstanding as a named boss.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I was unlucky!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If 5 Joint Attacks was activated with Kill, it would’ve been a fatal wound. However, he had the worst luck and 5 Joint Attacks wasn’t activated at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No, there is no need to worry.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A smile appeared on Grid’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was reminded that he had companions to cover for his lacking luck.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sura Descends!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas approached Elfin Stone’s side and started his lightning assault.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His destructive power at this moment was enough to make even Grid speechless.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeok!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pepepepeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The shining punches and kicks that left an afterglow!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Once Regas became an Asura, the true power of Grid’s Lightning Duke’s Knuckles started to explode.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The 6th combo has been achieved!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The unique effect of the Asura class is activated, dealing 5,000 fixed damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The effect of the ‘Lightning Duke’s Knuckles’ has been activated, causing additional physical damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[The 7th combo has been achieved!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The unique effect of the Asura class is activated, dealing 8,000 fixed damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The effect of the ‘Lightning Duke’s Knuckles’ has been activated, causing additional lightning damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[The 8th combo has been achieved!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The unique effect of the Asura class is activated, dealing 12,000 fixed damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The effect of the ‘Lightning Duke’s Knuckles’ has been activated, causing additional physical and lightning damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[The 10th combo has been achieved!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The unique effect of the Asura class is activated, dealing 20,000 fixed damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The option effect of the Lightning Duke’s Knuckles is activated, deploying Lightning Beam three times.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[The 12th combo has been achieved!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The unique effect of the Asura class is activated, dealing 30,000 fixed damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The effect of the ‘Lightning Duke’s Knuckles’ has been activated, causing additional physical damage proportional to the target’s maximum health.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuheok! Ugh! Kuak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone groaned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Regas opened up the power of an Asura and demonstrated a speed and power that couldn’t be endured by even Elfin Stone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the disadvantages were that the duration was short and the after effect was large.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas’s combo reached its peak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is the last one!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwajak!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kwajajajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[The 15th combo has been achieved!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The unique effect of the Asura class is activated, dealing 100,000 fixed damage to the target and reducing defense and recovery by 50% for 5 minutes. In addition, Lightning Spear is used.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puoook!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">90% of Elfin Stone’s total screams occurred today.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was pierced by the lightning spear that fell from the sky and finally sat down.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lightning Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the Asura’s ultimate move that disabled the target for 1.5 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok... P-Please...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Flop!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The drained Regas collapsed. He consumed a large amount of stamina at once, so he wouldn’t be able to move for three seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was up to his companions to fill this gap.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Mach Spear!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Draw Sword, Blow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Phoenix Arrow!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Black Winds!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The party members’ ultimate moves poured out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone tried to turn to smoke, but Lifael’s Spear was the problem. He was forced to allow the attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Good!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid smiled with satisfaction and started his sword dance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to the party members, Elfin Stone’s health had fallen to 45%, so Grid would used Linked Kill to ensure their victory.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, something unexpected happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You dare...! You dare!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Certain bosses became stronger once health fell to a certain level, and Elfin Stone was one of them.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puhahahak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Magic power stretched out around Elfin Stone and dominated the land.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Blood Field, which Grid had previously blocked, was instantly used.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Vampire Earl, Elfin Stone has opened up his real power. All of Elfin Stone’s stats will rise and his recovery ability will increase by 300%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your blood is influenced by Blood Field.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[153 health will be transferred to Earl Elfin Stone per second.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[All healing effects will be reduced by 80%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members felt desperate as the notification window appeared before them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will eat all of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone got up and declared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His red eyes were tinged with black.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The feeling of intimidation was incomparable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Now how should we defeat him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members were lost.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They weren’t sure how to deal with Elfin Stone, who had all his stats increased by Blood Field.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As everyone was feeling desperate...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t you know that I have a hidden power as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid spoke meaningful words.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone and the Overgeared members focused on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A hidden power?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone was nervous.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Truly God Grid!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He had a trump card!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members were delighted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As everyone’s attention was fixed on him, Grid shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Item! Combi!! Nation!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was it a cool animation like the transformation robots that were popular in his grandfather’s generation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, it was...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid took out a hammer and anvil, before squatting down and starting to hammer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Honestly, it was ludicrous behavior.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This person has become crazy from fear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The previously tense Elfin Stone ridiculed Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members felt embarrassed.</span></p>
