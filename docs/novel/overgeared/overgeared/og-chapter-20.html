 <p><span style="">Chapter 20</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">There was an uproar in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Famous guilds were in motion to find the mysterious blacksmith. In various media and the Internet, the epic-rated arrows appeared as a hot issue.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Who was the craftsman with great skills and potential but lacking experience and reputation?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Many people were searching for the blacksmith’s whereabouts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is a harder path than others. I always did my best. Nonetheless, there is a better blacksmith than me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Panmir had only experienced making an epic-rated item twice. He had the title of the first epic-rated item maker.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, there was no mention of ‘craftsman’ in his epic item description.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Who was the person given the title of craftsman, which wasn’t even allowed for the number one ranking blacksmith?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Panmir was spurred by a sense of competitiveness towards the unknown blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Meanwhile, Shin Youngwoo, the person who was receiving everyone’s attention, was eating cup noodles at a convenience store before going to work.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What a jerk, charging 1,000 won for a cup of noodles? Does he want people like me to starve to death? Sigh, people really can’t live without acting dirty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I grumbled as I ate.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* * *</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">5.30 a.m.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It might be Sunday, but the office of labor was always busy. The days when students came on a daily basis to find work had disappeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">These days, young people turned away from labor jobs!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Foreign workers had long taken over, making the future of South Korea seem bleak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have a headache.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I still hadn’t adapted to the smell of cigarettes and alcohol early in the morning.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I want to finish the work quickly so I can go home and rest.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As I sat there, a young man in a construction worker’s uniform cried out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Looking for four workers for the Shinwoo Building’s construction site!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Construction site workers did things like clean, move bricks and wood, and shovel sand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The physical labor was harsh, and I would eat a lot of dirt, but I had done it often. Therefore, I didn’t hesitate to raise my hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Here! Over here... </span><i><span style="">cough!</span></i><span style="">”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An alcohol drinker or heavy smoker punched me in the belly!&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was pushed into a corner and missed the chance to be employed by the construction site.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Those guys are heartless! You should send the pitiful young people first!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">While I was complaining with irritation, a middle-aged man in a short-sleeved shirt spoke, “I need three tilers with strength. You should have experience.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A tiles assistant would follow the main tiler and assist in the transfer of materials such as tiles, cement, and sand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was annoying to carry the tiles if I met a bad tiler and I had to be careful not to break the tiles, but it was decent work.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I raised my hand. “Here! I have carried tiles more than 10 times... </span><i><span style="">Ugh!</span></i><span style="">”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was once again pushed back into a corner by the older men and lost the chance to be hired because there were three people more experienced than me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Anyone else?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Here! I do… </span><i><span style="">Ack!</span></i><span style="">”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were several companies looking for laborers, but I wasn’t hired due to the continuous interference.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah, you! You will regret not seeing my value!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The older men in the workforce were hindering me. It seemed that they didn’t like me snatching away their spots.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Who could come here because they like it? Don’t you think I want to work part-time like other young people? I’m making a living just like you! Let me get something as well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The mere sight of them was enough to make me angry, like seeing a barking dog.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, my opponents were adults. So, I couldn’t say anything bad and sat down again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kukuk.” The chief, who had been reading his newspaper on his desk, looked at me. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was he around his early 30s? He was a person who inherited this office from his father.&nbsp;</span><span style="">For every 10 times I came here looking for a job, I’d gone home three times in vain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The chief was watching me when another person arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Who can do electric pulling work? No experience is needed. I will pay 110,000 won a day, so come quickly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was 20,000 won more than the usual pay.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, I didn’t move. Of course, there was a reason for offering more money.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can’t forget how awful it was.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I’d tried electrical cable pulling only once.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was just pulling a huge electrical cable, so it was a very simple task. However, it consumed a tremendous amount of stamina. I couldn’t let the cable hit my wrist. Moreover, the cables were very thick and the weight was heavy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was just pulling, but... I would get blisters on my hands even while wearing gloves, and I would suffer from muscle aches for at least two days.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It was an oasis in winter...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I still remembered the nightmare from last winter. The other men present looked into the distance, whistled or went out to smoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No one?” The man asked again with an awkward expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then one of the middle-aged men pointed towards me.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“This young man can do it very well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Really. He is very active and has amazing stamina.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hasn’t he done a lot of electrical cable pulling? An expert, expert.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘These insane humans!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I glared at them to stop, but the other men continued to recommend me. </span><span style="">Then the person offering the job pointed to me. “Excuse me, young man. Shall we go together? You look very good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If I followed the atmosphere, today I would enter hell.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I glanced towards the chief, but he just smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, I raise my phone to my ear, like I had received an incoming call. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes, this is Shin Youngwoo. Ah, there was a spot? Yes, right away...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ddiririring ~ ddiririring~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The default S Corporation’s ringtone was heard from the phone at my ear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, the other workers there laughed until tears emerged from their eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The employer also laughed. “Then let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Who would call me this early in the morning? Moreover, I barely ever received phone calls. So, how did I receive a call at this exact timing?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then I belatedly saw the caller ID and hurriedly picked up the phone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an unforgettable voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">(Hello~ This is Mother’s Heart is Happy Financial Services. Customer Shin Youngwoo, you do know that the deadline is tomorrow right?)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Already?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">(If you have forgotten, does that mean there is no money?)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“O-Of course not. Yes, I understand. I will have the amount ready for tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">(Thank you, Debt... no, Customer. Have a happy day. Mother’s Heart is Happy hopes you will smile today~)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The call ended.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This damn...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I’d played games and ignored reality, forgetting that I was a debtor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I had to work hard to pay off the interest. It would be hard work, not easy work, that would get me out of this position.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Excuse me... Will you really pay 110,000 won?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is it really true?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Of course! You will never go hungry when working for me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I eventually left towards hell.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That evening...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“O-Oppa?” Se-hee stammered when she saw my exhausted self return home.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I couldn’t even take my shoes off before collapsing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shit... The words were true, but... doing all that labor only to receive cream bread...? There wasn’t even milk...! What type of people would give cream bread and no milkkkkkk?!!! U-Ughhh... I have to play the game... Arrows... sold...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I couldn’t remember anything after that. It was because I fell asleep.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* * *</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">When I woke up, I felt like I had been crushed by steel. My body was throbbing all over, and I barely managed to check the time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was 5.20 a.m.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was serious. It was late when I took into consideration the distance between my house and the labor office.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I hurried to change into my work clothes while worrying about getting a good job. If I arrived late, then something like yesterday might happen again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ack~! I’m going.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After I paid the interest for the loan, I would only have 9,220 won in my hands. I needed to make money to pay the fee for the game in a week.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As I put on my shoes without washing up, my mother approached and patted my shoulder. “Come eat breakfast.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I can’t. I’m already late,” I replied hurriedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Youngwoo,” my mother suddenly said my name in a serious voice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I cowered reflexively. It was obvious that her nagging would begin.&nbsp;</span><span style="">My mother knew about my debts. She wondered why I was addicted to games and was saddened by my absence from school. She mourned that I had debts and was living in this situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, when I looked back, my mother’s eyes were calm and welcoming. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Come eat,” she said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-why? I have to go to the office quickly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that moment, the door opened, and my father appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">My father sat at the table, opened the newspaper and said quietly, “Take a break today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A break? What are you saying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“</span><i><span style="">Cough, cough.</span></i><span style="">” My father just coughed and looked at the newspapers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My mother whispered in my ears, “You came back really exhausted yesterday. Your father was worried since he carried you to your bedroom~”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“We are your mother and father. We don’t want to see our son suffer. Didn’t you suffer yesterday? You should rest for today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“M-Mother...” I was touched by the fact that my parents were still looking after me, despite all the disappointment I’d caused them in the past year.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that time, Sehee exited her room with a yawn and handed me something.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a pain relief patch.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Paste it on. Didn’t you go through a lot of trouble yesterday?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“S-Sehee...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Ahh! What a beautiful family!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I cried out as I embraced my mother and Sehee.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I’d thought I was alone in this difficult world, but I had such warm family beside me. My family members were like angels to their disappointing son and brother. I was truly grateful to have this family.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What? Who are you hugging? O-Oppa’s hug is good... Ah, no. Isn’t it bad?” Sehee grumbled quietly as she hugged me back, while my mother quietly stroked my head. </span><span style="">After that, I took off my work clothes and sat at the table, feeling the taste of beef rib soup for the first time in months.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Father, then can you pay off my debt?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Beeok!</span></i><span style=""> My father, who was eating quietly, gazed at me and threw his spoon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I shrieked as it hit me in the forehead, while my mother clicked her tongue and handed my father a new spoon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Haven’t I already told you? We want you to be self-reliant. You are already 26 years old. You should be responsible for your own actions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The atmosphere had been so full of harmony that I never imagined a spoon would fly over.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As I rubbed my forehead, my father handed me an envelope. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">He said, “I will give you an allowance for today. You are resting today because of us, so I can’t let you make a loss.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Father...” I was touched. My usually blunt father was taking care of me today. I would gladly accept the allowance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Then…’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I grasped the number of bills in the envelope with my sharp fingertips, but the number seemed a little small?&nbsp;</span><span style="">When I looked inside the envelope, I saw seven bills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Feeling disappointed, I spoke carefully, “Father, the minimum payment for labor these days is at least 9...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My father looked at me regretfully. “Huh, really? I’m sorry, but that is all the cash I have on me right now. Be satisfied with that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was telling me not to ask for the missing amount later.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I had forgotten, but my father was quite restrained when it came to spending money. If he bought a chicken, he thought that the family should eat it over three meals.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was forced to surrender at receiving an allowance of 70,000 won.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘At least he gave it in the first place.’</span></p>
