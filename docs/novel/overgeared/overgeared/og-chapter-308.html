 <p><span style="">Chapter 308</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The man who made Tallos scream with just one Magic Missile.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The ID ‘Grid’ was above his head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Violet’s group and the reporters were extremely confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is that Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The first legendary class, Grid!&nbsp;</span><span style="">How many people in this world didn’t know him?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Except for children under six years old and elderly people over 80, most people had probably heard Grid’s name.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Violet’s group also knew about Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">How he lived a hard life before obtaining a legendary class, how he absorbed the Tzedakah Guild, and so on.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There wasn’t much that the rankers and reporters didn’t know about Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s why the impact was larger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘How could Grid use a spell?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He often used Fly. However, it was already analyzed that it was a magic that only showed up when he was wearing certain boots.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then what about now?&nbsp;</span><span style="">They didn’t know why, but Grid wasn’t wearing a single item. He was wearing the basic clothes that were provided to everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In other words, the Magic Missile he used a while ago wasn’t magic attached to an item, but a spell he used directly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘How can a blacksmith use magic...? Heok! D-Don't tell me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Perhaps! A second class!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The mysterious Mongol was the first to earn a second class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Over a period of a year and a half, more than 100 people with second classes had appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They couldn’t rule out the possibility that Grid was one of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A legendary class and now a second class...!?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is a headline!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The cameras of the excited reporters were focused solely on Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had completely lose interest in Violet’s group.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Violet felt bad for many reasons.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She invested millions of gold in this raid, reporters were filming this failure, and now Grid interfered?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was tiring and annoying.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She threatened the reporters with legal action, then shouted to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid! Don’t you know the basic etiquette? Intervening in an ongoing raid without permission, it is an act that deserves criticism!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Violet was a woman, but she spoke like a man.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In addition, her outward appearance was no different from a man. Her hair was short and she was wearing heavy armor with no embellishments.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The complex about her physique was a large reason behind her neutral appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Etiquette?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid slowly descended from the collapsed ceiling.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He looked down at Violet with a chilling gaze and smirked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You want to impose etiquette on someone superior to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Violet’s face reddened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Speaking in this tone to someone he met for the first time? And he was superior?&nbsp;</span><span style="">What a bunch of crap!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s the first time I’ve seen such an arrogant expression!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was a legendary class, duke of a kingdom, and master of the Overgeared Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a representative of all of them, he should be more careful with his remarks and behavior.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Violet was extremely disappointed and embarrassed about these arrogant actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The same was true for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Braham you bastard...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham currently had control of Grid’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was the one who just said those words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I didn’t say that!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid shouted, but it only echoed in Braham’s brain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was feeling frustrated while Braham approached Violet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Redness appeared on both of Violet’s cheeks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘H-Handsome?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Originally, Grid’s appearance was ordinary. His cool eyes and prideful attitude made him look not bad, but he couldn’t be called handsome.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now he was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The white skin that was in harmony with the white hair, the sharp jaws, and the ruby eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The subtle difference highlighted his facial faces and brought Grid’s appearance to another level.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Even Violet’s heart started pounded, despite lacking confidence as a woman and building up a wall against the opposite sex.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reporters also realized that Grid’s appearance was different from normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What? How is he so handsome just from dying his hair?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is obviously...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The puzzled reporters suddenly recalled something.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Plastic surgery!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reporters were convinced that Grid received plastic surgery, since South Korea was famous for it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was a misunderstanding.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid didn’t get plastic surgery. He had no major complaints about his face, and was brave enough to endure it if he ever received a terrible injury.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If it wasn’t plastic surgery, how did Grid look like this?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the aftermath of accepting Braham’s soul.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s appearance was partially assimilated with Braham’s appearance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Just as women had the power of makeup and celebrities had lighting, Grid currently had the power of a soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I am not the one being rude, you are. You should be thankful that I saved you, yet you dared speak to me in such a way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Wow, really arrogant.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Violet’s group and the reporters all clicked their tongue at Grid’s arrogance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Violet was filled with anger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She wanted to apply for a PK duel with Grid right away.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But her opponent was the leader of Overgeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She didn’t know how her guild would suffer if she did.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Violet refused to talk to Grid anymore, but he didn’t mind. No, Braham liked it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, lower your tail. It is your duty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I'm screwed!'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid wanted to cry.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was scared about gaining a large number of anti-fans because of Braham.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will be cursed in every Internet article about me!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The number of fan club members would decrease and there would be a flood of personal attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the worst case, people might curse his parents, like how Huroi normally spoke.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As Grid was grieving, his body moved on its own.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He ignored Violet’s group and faced Tallos.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Where is Amoract’s soul hiding?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">During the time Grid wasted speaking to Violet, Tallos had restored his wounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What is Amoract’s soul? Why are you asking me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Magic Missile."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Keok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tallos was appalled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because the Magic Missile used by the white haired person penetrated his chest once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘How can this be?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tallos was a fourth advancement black magician and one of the 10 great magicians on the continent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Strong magic power was always surrounding his body, so weak spells couldn’t penetrate through it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now a Magic Missile pierced his chest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was something that shouldn’t have happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No way... What the hell is your identity?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He tried to repair the wound while asking the question, but Grid once again launched a Magic Missile.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Tallos was hit in the thigh and fell to his knees.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is crazy!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tallos was about to go crazy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was elected as the agent of Amoract, yet he was suffering because of Magic Missiles?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t accept it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid fired another Magic Missile at Tallos, who realized the seriousness of the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tallos screamed as his heart was pierced this time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He coughed up a large amount of blood, as Grid casually asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Just answer my question. Where is Amoract’s soul hiding?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ack...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Unlike what the world knew, Tallos wasn’t Yatan’s First Servant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The true First Servant was Amoract, the great demon of conflict. The only ones who knew this truth were the servants of Yatan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tallos questioned it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is his identity? How is he so strong, and how does he know about Amoract?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid fired another Magic Missile at him after he didn’t answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tallos fell after being hit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was painful, but his shame was greater.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was one of the continent’s 10 great magicians!&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the surface, he was Yatan’s First Servant!&nbsp;</span><span style="">The dogs of the Dominion Church were watching as he was humiliated by Magic Missile!&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an absolute disgrace!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The incensed Tallos started to attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I won’t forgive you...! Death Fear!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kyaaaak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The illusion of hundreds of evil spirits appeared behind Tallos, and a powerful shock wave occurred.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The members of the Yatan Church, Violet’s group, and reporters from various national television stations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">All of them felt terrible pain and panic under the influence of the magic that didn’t distinguish between friend or foe. They collapsed and their blood vessels turned black.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid was fine.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Tallos was greatly confused, but he didn’t make a mistake and linked the next spell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dark Rage!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was hit by black magic power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a spell that could even penetrate the thick leather of a basilisk.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Tallos smiled with satisfaction but was still alert. Magic was linked continuously and the ground around Grid was devastated as it burned with flames summoned from hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He used all his power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was normal for Grid to be turned into ashes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he was fine.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"O-Only Shield...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The lowest level defense magic, Shield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It absorbed a certain amount of damage. This extremely simple and basic magic disabled four of his strongest black spells.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Did he have trouble?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, it was simple!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Does this make sense?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">20 years.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Tallos had been playing the role of Amoract’s representative for that long.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He always maintained his grandeur, but now he was suffering like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You monster! I’m not a match for you, so kill me quickly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s attitude towards him didn’t change at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Magic Missile."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuaaaaak! Shit! Shit!! Kill me in one blow with Meteor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Magic Missile."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuheok! You cruel bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The First Servant of Yatan, killed by Magic Missile!&nbsp;</span><span style="">If this rumor spread, he was concerned that the image of the Yatan Church would be severely damaged.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Tallos hoped that the white haired man would kill him with higher level magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, the white haired man continued to use Magic Missile, making Tallos go crazy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It didn’t take long for the strong mental power of the strongest black magician to succumb.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“P-Please... Please stop with Magic Missile...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tallos was begging.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid stopped just as he was about to use Magic Missile again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Where is Amoract’s soul hiding?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"L-Ludhadan Cave...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Magic Missile was more effective than any mental spell. The stronger the opponent’s pride, the more they were affected.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was enough to open Tallos’ mouth, despite his deep loyalty to Amoract.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay. I will take your trivial life in exchange for that answer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tallos begged.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wasn’t begging for his life.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wanted something separate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“P-Please kill me with advanced magic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He would be too embarrassed if he was killed with Magic Missile. Tallos didn’t want such a situation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid nodded at Tallos, who was desperately asking for advanced magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Fireball.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This dog ㅅ...!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tallos’ curse didn’t last long. He was swallowed by flames that were as hot as hellfire and turned to ashes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have defeated Amoract’s agent, Tallos.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[2,620,090,770 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A Dark Rune has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Wow...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid confirmed that Braham was still level 545 in the status window.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This meant that Grid was the one who levelled up, not Braham.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘S-Such profit...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members would be shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid raised his level and received an unidentified rune just for accepting Braham’s soul!&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was feeling thrilled by the unexpected gain when the reporters rushed towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Did you acquire a magician as a second class?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why is your Magic Missile so powerful? That was Magic Missile, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Your shield’s defense was beyond imagination! How high is your magic power?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The fireball seemed like hellfire! What’s the secret behind this great skill?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reporters looked at him with envy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their resentment towards Grid’s arrogant attitude disappeared.</span></p>
