 <p><span style="">Chapter 164</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Hell Gao, who didn’t move when the top three damage dealers of the guild attacked simultaneously...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Pushing him back with one shot?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is that attack power?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is that tail that defended against Hell Gao’s attack?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why is he still holding the pickaxe...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an unbelievable and monstrous sight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Silver Knights Guild, included Peak Sword, were confused at the sight of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I thought he was a tanker because of his high defense, but his attack power is actually higher?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were several classes with excellent balance. But balance-type classes had a chronic problem. It was that they didn’t excel in anything.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, both Grid’s attack power and defense were unreasonable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He must have a hidden class. In addition...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s words revolved around Peak Sword’s head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Item effect. Item effect. Item effect... Item...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘...It really is the power of his items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In Satisfy, items could be enhanced up to +10.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, the price of the enhancement stones was expensive, and the higher the enhancement value, the lower the probability of the enhancement succeeding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In addition, if the enhancement was successful, the enhancement value would be +1. But if it failed, it would be -3, so the chances of ordinary users owning high enhanced equipment was like picking stars from the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most rankers were using +7 items, while the +8 or higher items were for the rich or fortunate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, Peak Sword belatedly realized that Grid’s sword was surrounded by a deep orange light that was like the sunset.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a +8 enhanced item.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘So he is a high level hidden class, rich, and lucky?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid frowned at Peak Sword’s expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...What is your expression?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t a coincidence that a big shot came here.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword was alarmed and started to feel doubts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You look like a Chinese or Japanese person. Did the Sakura Guild send you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had the typical appearance of a Northeast Asian.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Korea and Mongolia were countries weak in Satisfy, he judged that a bigshot couldn’t be hiding among the Koreans or Mongols. Therefore, this person must be Chinese or Japanese.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the answer that came back was amazing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Sakura Guild? I didn’t even know there was such a guild. Above all, I am South Korean.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"South Korean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The guild members started murmuring.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"There is such an amazing person among the Koreans...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Apart from Yura and Peak Sword hyung-nim... South Korea has another prominent figure."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kya~~! As expected from South Korea!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Most of the members of the Silver Knights Guild were patriotic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were the type of people who always asked ‘Do you know Kimchi?’ when they met foreigners.&nbsp;</span><span style="">So they were glad to hear that Grid was Korean.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“We are Koreans like you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I realized it while watching you! The Korean’s game DNA is still great!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I am proud that a great person like you is a Korean citizen like us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Quiet!”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword calmed down his excited guild members and glared at Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"If you aren’t commissioned by the Sakura Guild, why did you come to disturb us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Disturb?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Chaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was shaken as he drew Hell Gao’s aggro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Disturb? Is what I did a disturbance? Rather, I helped you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What help? You barged in on another person’s raid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid felt angry at Peak Sword’s words. Then he threw down his pickaxe and grabbed Dainsleif with both hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ridiculous humans! I will burn you to the soul!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hell Gao waved his staff while shouting and a heat storm struck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid started dancing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Pagma’s Swordsmanship...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Become ashes!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuwaaaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The materials in the area were melted and a hot wind blew over Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Grid’s dance finished.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was truly an overwhelming sight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The big sword was surrounded by red and black and pierced Hell Gao’s heart with a huge momentum.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuheok...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There wasn’t one person who failed to notice that Hell Gao’s face shrouded in flames was disturbed for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hell Gao fell down and scattered blood like lava, while Grid spoke to the astonished Peak Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I’m sorry that I barged in on your raid but honestly, if it wasn’t for me, wouldn’t you guys be dead to that monster by now? The only reason I got involved was because that annoying bastard attacked me first. I didn’t actually do anything?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His words weren’t wrong.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But that didn’t mean Grid’s behavior could be rationalized.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I acknowledge that part. But the fact that you intruded doesn’t change. How can we proceed with the raid while you are watching? Would you be able to if you were us? What if you hit our backs while we are in the middle of the fight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid snorted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"If I wanted to hit your backs, I would’ve done it earlier. Isn't that right?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The guild was in trouble when Hell Gao appeared. But Grid was fine. At that time, the guild would’ve met a disaster if Grid had attacked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“U-Um...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was evidence that Grid wasn’t an enemy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he was still disturbing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had completely stabbed a wedge of doubt in Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"In the first place, I didn’t come here for that monster. Fire stones.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Grid placed Dainsleif back in his inventory. Then he picked up the pickaxe and headed towards a firestone again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I have no intention of interfering, so please ignore me and go on with the raid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kaaang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword no longer felt motivation as he looked at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'...He isn’t an opponent that can be overpowered, so let’s ignore him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They could deal with this when it was over.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword ignored Grid and started concentrating on the raid. Then the guild members quickly surrounded Hell Gao, who was on the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid glanced at them and clicked his tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Do you really think you can raid that monster? It’s useless.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The current Grid couldn’t measure Hell Gao’s combat strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'That monstrous bastard, he was hit by Kill and didn’t even lose one-tenth of his life.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hell Gao was a monster that Muller couldn’t seal perfectly, and he was very strong.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid speculated that he was a boss monster several degrees stronger than the Awakened Guardian of the Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He is a monster that I can’t win against, even if I take advantage of my invincible passive. It’s better to avoid him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s judgment was correct.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Most users didn’t know the details of the demon-related episodes yet, but Hellfire’s Master Hell Gao was the 9th strongest among the 33 great demons of Hell and had members of the demonkin like Balak as subordinates. It wasn’t good to associate with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Hurry.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kaaang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s pickaxe speed accelerated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He planned to use the time while the Silver Knights Guild was striking Hell Gao to mine the fire stones.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That behavior was the problem.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What was the reason why the fire stones always appeared with Hell Gao?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t a coincidence.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The fire stones were the source of Hell Gao’s power. Hell Gao needed the help of the fire stones to appear in the human world.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A human kept trying to mine it, so Hell Gao couldn’t leave it alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This damn human!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Hell Gao released a black fire that burned the Silver Knights Guild and headed towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Chaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The pavranium moved to protect Grid. However, it was impossible to completely block Hell Gao’s attack with the present pavranium, which was attached to the armor and restricted in action.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid experienced a flash of heat every time the staff was wielded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 2,930 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 3,190 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘How rotten... I’ve raised my fire resistance, but I’ve still received this much damage.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kaaang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid took a potion to restore his health and quickened the pace of his pickaxe. He tried to ignore the attacking Hell Gao behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Just a bit more...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Five more swings would be enough to obtain one fire stone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid patiently relied on only pavranium to defend and Hell Gao’s anger reached the peak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Stop right now!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Hell Gao’s body was covered with blame flames, increasing the heat.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Hell Gao’s attack power became stronger. The pavranium was hit by it and temporarily stiffened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is bad...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hell Gao’s staff aimed at Grid’s side just as there were three swings left to obtain the fire stone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid tried to defend with a shield but it was already too late.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that moment, Peak Sword came forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Draw Sword, string.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword stood 2m behind Hell Gao.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He pulled out the sword at his waist so quickly that it was difficult to follow with the eyes. Then there was a sharp flash and blood spurted from Hell Gao’s neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuooh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hell Gao’s gaze angrily returned to Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Insolent!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hell Gao approached Peak Sword and waved his staff.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Peak Sword placed his sword back in its sheath.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sheath Sword, breadth.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Just before Hell Gao’s staff fell towards Peak Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A powerful wave of sword energy exploded around Peak Sword, causing Hell Gao to retreat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword spoke to Grid with a grim expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You are Korean and helped us once. With this, the debt is paid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Subsequently, the Silver Knights Guild started their onslaught.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Die, you monster!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This time we’ll kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Silver Knights were a highly trained guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The qigong masters suppressed Hell Gao’s heat, while the damage dealers attacked Hell Gao without getting injured.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a pincer attack they could unfold due to the experience challenging Hell Gao, but the problem was that Hell Gao was too strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This doesn’t even itch!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hell Gao ridiculed before launching flames in every direction.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the inevitable fire AOE magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In order to suppress the force of this, the qigong masters controlled the mana in the air while the magicians built water barriers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The momentum of the flames wasn’t suppressed at all and directly evaporated all the water at the water barriers.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">This caused hot steam to occur.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword and the knights defended with their weapons or shields, while the qigong masters and magicians used magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, everyone except for Peak Sword turned into grey light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sword Peak realized it the moment he received more than 100 messages about his guild members’ deaths.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is impossible.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Hell Gao raid?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a pipe dream.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had been confident about the guild’s power over the last month, but they were just pests in front of Hell Gao.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It was my mistake for not accurately measuring Hell Gao’s strength...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He felt sorry for the guild members wiped out because of their foolish master.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the moment that Peak Sword lost hope in his dream of fostering enough Korean rankers to play a role in next years National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He flopped down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kukukuk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hell Gao emitted a hot breath as he laughed and approached. He aimed his staff at Peak Sword who lost all his men and all hope.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[A fire stone has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid finally obtained a fire stone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At the same time, the black flames around Hell Gao’s body noticeably weakened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">And.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttaak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 4,200 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword survived despite being hit by the staff.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Both Peak Sword and Hell Gao were shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Weaker?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t an illusion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hell Gao had rapidly weakened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">An awkward atmosphere flowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Transcended Link.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">20 blue and white energy blades flew and hit Hell Gao.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Blood spurted in every direction like boiling lava.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hell Gao let out a terrible scream of pain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he belated discovered the fire stone held in Grid’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You dare...! I will kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pisik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Can you do it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid laughed before squeezing the blue sword that was reminiscent of a predator of the sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword was surprised twice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The first reason was that he figured out Grid was Pagma’s Descendant who appeared in the battle of Bairan several months ago. The second reason for his surprise was the white light around the blue greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A +9 item?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Take this pickaxe.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid threw his pickaxe towards Peak Sword, whose mouth was gaping open. Then he explained to the puzzled Peak Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Hell Gao’s weakness is the fire stone. The more fire stones that are collected, the weaker he will be. So collect the fire stones while I block him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword’s expression darkened,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I understand what you're saying. But I didn’t acquire the mining skill. It will be hard for me...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Don’t worry. Anyone can mine with that pickaxe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid spoke confidently.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword was curious and checked the details of the pickaxe.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Fantastic Pickaxe]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Legendary</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 155/219 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 107</span></p>

 <p><span style="">* The chances of acquiring the highest grade minerals will increase by 5%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The skill ‘Intermediate Mining Technique’ Lv. 3 will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A pickaxe made by the legendary blacksmith G.</span></p>

 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 200 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 45</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why are you just watching?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hell Gao wasn’t a fool. He couldn’t let the humans touch the fire stones anymore, so he tried to get rid of the injured Peak Sword first.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid wouldn’t quietly let him do that.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He detached the pavranium from his armor and aimed at Hell Gao’s head with his fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Go."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chwachwachwachwachwachwa!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The combined pavranium separated into seven blade-like shapes. Then they spread out and attacked Hell Gao from different angles.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuooh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hell Gao missed Peak Sword. He lifted his staff and resisted the seven blades, but they couldn’t be destroyed no matter what.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No, what is this...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword thought it was absurd.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It felt like a feast of items kept appearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Item effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The words Grid said when he first appeared popped into Peak Sword’s head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Grid prompted him,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“What are you doing? Go and mine the fire stones.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah, y-yes... That... Yes...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 16th ranked Peak Sword, it was the first time he challenged mining since starting Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And it was the day that Hell Gao, the master of hellfire, met the strongest enemy after the great sword saint Muller.</span></p>
