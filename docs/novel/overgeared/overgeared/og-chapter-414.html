 <p><span style="">Chapter 414</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Bubat has been logged out! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Criticisms towards Bubat flooded in as he died.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Turkish people were disappointed by his pathetic ability that allowed Grid’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">There are a large number of allies, so it’s natural to tank while your allies deal damage to the enemies.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">What type of tanker challenges a person to a one-on-one battle?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Bubat lacks one-on-one experience.</span></i> <i><span style="">Seriously the worst.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Basically, Grid is the strongest.</span></i> <i><span style="">How did such a monster appear in a small and weak Satisfy country like South Korea?</span></i> <i><span style="">I’m sick because we have been grabbed by South Korea two years in a row.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">This year, the one with the lowest ranking seems to be Turkey.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Won’t Bubat lose his sponsors soon?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The logged out Bubat couldn’t raise his head. He was afraid to return to Turkey.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, Grid remained on the battlefield and was still admiring it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s a huge passive skill.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid confirmed the damage of Pinnacle and decided that it was possible to finish off Bubat with Pinnacle Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he was wrong.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pinnacle Kill did much less damage than expected.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was presumed that Bubat had a passive skill where ‘only a % of the maximum health’ was decreased by a strong blow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If his armor was unsealed, it would’ve taken much longer.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had the Blacksmith’s Eyes skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He could check the information of an item if he looked at it for three seconds. This could be a double-edged sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was because the item information window interfered with his field of view.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Anyway, Grid learned one thing through the Blacksmith’s Eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bubat’s armor was currently sealed and couldn’t perform at its full capabilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The undefeated king.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was he also one of the nine legends?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s expression wasn’t good as he moved.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He spent longer than expected dealing with Bondre and Bubat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I feel like my luck is really bad.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was one reason why Grid used the Holy Light set instead of the newly created equipment, including Three Layers and Lantier’s Cloak.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was hoping to trigger the 5 Joint Attacks skill attached to the Holy Light Gloves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">If 5 Joint Attacks was activated, Grid would be able to deal with the enemy faster because he could deal five times as much damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, the problem was that it wasn’t activated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Since he entered the Behen Archipelago until now, the number of times 5 Joint Attacks was activated had significantly decreased.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid felt like his odds when it came to games of luck was becoming worse.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I am angry.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He wanted to make an item that would increase his luck.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘...Eh? Isn’t this good?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was better than the good luck state in many ways. In an extreme example, if he wore items that increased luck, he could increase the chances of producing higher rated items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid thought such things while moving to save the Korean team. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At this moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t show any signs of nerves, despite the Korean team being in a crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He believed in his companions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reason why Grid decided on this high risk operation, which was to immediately attack the targets and attract the aggro of the enemies, was because he trusted in Yura and Peak Sword’s abilities.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">4 minutes after the commencement of the target processing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">While Grid was defeating Bondre and Bubat in succession, the Korean team was struggling against the allied teams.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Fire Wall!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Multi Shot."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The archer Jonghwa and the magician Sumin didn’t consider their mana, trying their best to tie up the feet of the enemies while the tailor Jinhee did his best to set up a protective tent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The tanker Kyunghoon used skills to slow down the enemies’ advance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But they were weak.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were at least 40 levels lower than the other players, making it impossible to endure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Shit, when is Grid coming?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Park Jonghwa said nervously.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had a negative impression of this plan from the beginning, so he couldn’t help grumbling. He fired his arrows relentlessly, but there wasn’t a single enemy who collapsed. His weak arrows couldn’t penetrate the enemies’ defenses.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rather, his wounds increased due to the counterattacks. His health had already fallen to a risky level. He would’ve died sooner if it wasn’t for the 50% reduced PvP damage patch.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sumin’s mana reached the bottom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I can’t use magic anymore...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shit! Hey, Jinhee! Haven’t you completed the tent yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I-I'm sorry. I think it will take 3 more minutes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This... Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ku tang tang tang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Kyunghoon barely blocked an attack with his shield and went flying.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The person who blew him away was Australia’s leading ranker, Luca.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Stop the senseless resistance. Aren’t you just tiring yourselves out in this attempt to buy time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Luca was 80th on the unified rankings and had a third advancement class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Korean team members couldn’t go against him. He faced them with cold eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The end.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Park Jonghwa thought with frustration.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Our goal is to win, not buy time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura was handling the targets with her rifle while being protected by her team members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This time, she was the one protecting her team members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Luca looked at her and laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I wondered what type of hidden class you got after disappearing from the rankings, but it was just a gunman?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Gunman, a hidden class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">One of their advantages was that they used a rifle, which had a longer attack distance and more powerful attacks than archers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had the highest attack power among physical damage dealers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But the weakness was clear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had low health and defense, and their evasion rate was ridiculously low.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They didn’t have as many utility skills as magicians. It was safe to say that once they allowed the enemies to approach, they would die.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">For Luca, a gunman was just good prey.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I don’t like the pretty faces of Asian people, so I will use this opportunity to trample on it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Luca grinned and rushed towards Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His speed was very fast. His defense and evasion was great, so he avoided any fatal blows from the few shots fired by Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yura!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The South Korean team was desperate. It was the same for all Koreans watching the game.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They didn’t want to see the goddess of Korea being trampled on.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Did their wish reach the sky?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura didn’t panic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She avoided Luca’s attack and cut at him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yes, it was a cut.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From a gunman.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Luca’s eyes widened as he felt terrible pain.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Draw Sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment that Peak Sword placed his hand on his sheath.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Ten team members jumping at him flinched back.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword normally seemed stupid, but his presence was different on the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Annihilate.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Flash!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was well known that Peak Sword had cut apart dozens of enemies during the Silver Knights war with Japan’s Sakura Guild over Cork Island.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That famous story was now being reproduced in the eyes of the world.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword felt the ultimate pleasure at his Draw Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">By using the shortest distance from the sheath to the attack point, the enemy couldn’t recognize it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh...?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kukukukukung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a flash and everyone in front of Peak Sword collapsed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The rankers felt a chill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 13,520 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 12,144 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 9,050 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 8,600....]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The pain came late.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘How can a ranged skill do so much damage...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The rankers suffered serious damage from the strikes and couldn’t believe it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Peak Sword wasn’t satisfied with his own attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Damn, the effect of the patch is too great.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The only advantage of his class with a long attack delay was the power of his strikes. It was worth it since one attack could deal a fatal blow to the enemies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, in the National Competition, Peak Sword couldn’t exert his original strength and the advantage of his class disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hit him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Let's go!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The wounded rankers of the allied teams rushed towards Peak Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were aware of the weakness of Peak Sword’s class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword couldn’t link an attack until the sword returned to the sheath, so their aim was this defenseless gap.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Peak Sword’s weapon was made by a legendary blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Ideal Longsword]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 308/308 &nbsp;Attack Power: 680</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Attack Speed: +21%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The skill ‘Wind Blast’ is generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The skill ‘Quick Movements’ is generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 310 or higher. Advanced Sword Mastery level 5 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The durability and attack power was lacking compared to the same unique-rated Iyarugt, but it couldn’t be denied that it was one of the best one-handed swords.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Furthermore, it was a longsword that maximized the advantages of Grid’s Ideal Dagger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a very suitable weapon for Peak Sword, whose attack speed was important.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Furthermore, Grid had prepared another gift for Peak Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The gift was a sheath.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Peak Sword’s Sheath]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* 20% increase in sword drawing speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* 40% increase in sword recovering speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a sheath that used one of the Water Clan King’s Tears that Euphemina obtained in the Siren Kingdom to attach Zednos’ wind magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A gust of wind occurred to increase the speed of Draw Sword. at the same time, a whirlwind would recover the sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“God Grid! I will surely become more overgeared!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword tearfully cried out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The faces of the rankers turned pale at the sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'That recovering speed...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Ridiculously fast!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The rankers didn’t step back, despite the sight before them exceeding common sense. To be precise, they couldn’t step back. It was already all or nothing with Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Die!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"A country weak in Satisfy, you should collapse quickly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">All types of weapons stabbed at Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The storm surrounded Peak Sword as there was once again a dazzling light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword was thrilled as he confirmed the enemies’ screams and collapse.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is the power of items!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Overcoming the limitations of his class with items... Peak Sword was excited and amazed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“T-The sky above the sky...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">While South Korea and the allied teams were fighting chaotically on one side of Tira, Kraugel was in full swing elsewhere.</span></p>
