 <p><span style="">Chapter 326</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">There were less than 400 students enrolled in the Young Ladies HIgh School.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the scale of the school was incredibly large.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A total area of 161,150 ㎡.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were two playgrounds, as well as an indoor and outdoor pool. It was fully equipped with training rooms, exhibition halls, gymnasiums, and various facilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was similar to the size of a university, so it was remarkable for a high school.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why was a high school like this created?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reason was the ideology of Kim Jeongsook, the founder of the school and chairman of the foundation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An affluent environment was needed to bring up a great lady!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was her philosophy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In fact, the Young Ladies High School was able to become one of the most prestigious schools after 50 years.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Many girls wanted to enter the Young Ladies High School due to the excellent facilities and beautiful landscape.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It meant that the Young Ladies High School’s large grounds was working for them.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The festival of the Young Ladies High School was in full swing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In this crowd, there were two men.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The people who completely covered their faces with large sunglasses and a mask were none other than Youngwoo and Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow, why is this school so big? I heard the rumors, but I didn’t expect it to be like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo went to a local university. It was a university that he could afford, and the size was very small. Compared to that, the Young Ladies High School was three times bigger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Isn’t this your sister’s school? But this is your first time seeing it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I always waited at the front gate. This is the first time I’ve seen inside.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I see... Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword frowned while conversing with Grid. He trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Takoyaki? Okonomiyaki? Yakisoba? Dammit! This isn’t Japan! Why are these dishes being sold at a Korean high school festival?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword was angry.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Many of the stalls lined up from the front gate of the school to the inside of the campus had signboards written in Japanese.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was like walking the streets of Hongdae, only to find a Japanese pub. It was hard to tell if this was Korea or Japan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The Korean people are very kind and generous! Our ancestors suffered during the Japanese occupation, but their descendants have forgiven Japan and accepted their culture! My goodness! Our tolerance is too great!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword was president of the Korean Patriotic Association and loved Korea very much. He tended to think too positively.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo clicked his tongue and looked around.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There are too many people.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo wasn’t interested in whether the street vendors sold Korean, Japanese, or Chinese food.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo was only worried about Sehee.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Kim Doohyun!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo was determined to stop Doohyun from reaching Sehee and using his position of world star on her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there was a problem.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was this great crowd.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was hard to take a step, because the crowd was much greater than he expected. It would take him 10 minutes to move 100 meters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Maybe many fans came because they heard Kim Doohyun was coming...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It happened when Youngwoo was busy thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hey there, handsome oppa.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One student approached them with a shy expression. It was a small student wearing an apron and cooking hat. She was very cute and pretty.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Huh, why did you call me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was reminded of Sehee when he saw the schoolgirl, so he was very kind and friendly. It didn’t match his usual appearance, so Peak Sword got goosebumps.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We have a new desert that our dessert club has released for this festival. Would you like to try it? It is only 3,000 won.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The schoolgirl waved her apron to tempt them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was active in soliciting street sales for the stall her club was operating.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo didn’t want to spend money. However, this person might be Sehee’s friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo finally nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, give me one."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hehe! Thank you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The schoolgirl dragged Youngwoo and Peak Sword to her stall.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the menu attached to the street stall was strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Kimchi ice cream? Kimchi cake?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He got an ominous feeling.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo turned pale, while Peak Sword’s eyes shone like lanterns.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh! These kids are the only ones! Making kimchi as a dessert so that it is more accessible to foreigners, it’s really amazing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...It is amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the first place, why did they need to force kimchi onto foreigners? In addition, wasn’t there any other food to represent Korea except for kimchi?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo couldn’t understand it at all.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he heard the voice of the schoolgirl holding a cup of kimchi ice cream.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Look. Didn’t I bring some people? I smiled once and they followed right after me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hehe, it seems like they are suckers for schoolgirls.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Please make your words more inaudible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo reminded himself of his sister and swallowed down his anger as he reached out for the two ice creams.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“8,000 won!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? Didn’t you say it was 3,000 won?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Two of them cost 8,000 won!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo looked at the smiling face of the schoolgirl and his expression darkened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kids were truly scary these days.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo sighed and flicked the girl’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Act moderately, you brat. Who do you think you are?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“H-Hik.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tears filled the high school girl’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo had a good skeletal frame and his strength was quite good from exercising for a while. He didn’t know how to control his strength.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo was confused when he saw the girl crying and stroked her forehead. It was an effort to relieve the pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"D-Don't cry. Then the price...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hnng.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The girl let out a strange sound as she was touched in the forehead.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her neck, ears and cheeks turned red while her legs loosened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo was horrified when he saw her cloudy eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘My damn dexterity...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was good that it was effective, but there was a time and place!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo didn’t want to be called a sexual harasser, so he hurriedly shouted towards Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Quickly pay the price!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh? Y-Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was the problem?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword couldn’t understand the situation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wasn’t he the one who wanted to buy the ice cream in the first place? He paid 8,000 won and followed behind Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ohhhhhh!" This is a real delicacy! The sweet kimchi melts on the tongue! Foreigners will love it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Eat everything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo passed his ice cream to the thrilled Peak Sword. Then he opened up his phone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He checked the text message that he received from Yerim one hour ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[At this festival, Sehee and I are working at a haunted house *^0^* I am a sexy ♥ ghost]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cough...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A photo was attached to the words.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yerim was wearing a uniform that revealed her white thighs and part of her chest, not looking suitable for her age.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is obviously a virgin ghost.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were no male ghosts.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Well, it was still nice to see.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he was concerned and uncomfortable when he thought of his sister dressing like this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kim Doohyun was sure to target her!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo nervously tried to find a way through the crowd when he was reminded of something.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘My dexterity.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He made thousands of items in Satisfy and pleasured Irene, training his dexterity.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It reached the point where he decided to use these techniques in real life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It will turn out okay. I’ve figured out the trick after peeling garlic every night.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was being used against schoolgirls? This wasn’t what Youngwoo intended at the time.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttuduk!</span></i> <i><span style="">Dduk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo opened his hands and told Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Follow along well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How was he going to make it through the crowd?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword looked puzzled while eating the ice cream.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hnng!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hat!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kyaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Whenever Grid’s hands lightly touched the waist or back of a woman obstructing their way, the woman would make a strange sound and sit down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘W-What is this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was like Moses’ miracle was being reproduced.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The women sat down and opened the path whenever Youngwoo moved, so this phenomenon could only be described as a miracle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“T-Truly God Grid...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He didn’t know the principle behind it, but God Grid was really great.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword followed proudly behind Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The festival was held for a total of three days, with an average of 10,000 visitors during the festival.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It went beyond the concept of a high school festival, and also played a large economic role.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was intentional marketing when the Young Ladies High School festival was often mentioned in the news.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I am very pleased that Doohyun-ssi has decided to attend our festival.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The principle of the Young Ladies High School, Lee Cheongsun, welcomed Kim Doohyun enthusiastically.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Every year at the festival, she spent a lot of money to invite idols. However, Kim Doohyun decided to attend the festival for no attendance fee, despite being a world star.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to this, Lee Cheongsun was very pleased. She would be highly evaluated by the board of directors.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It’s nothing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kim Doohyun started to check the festival’s schedule.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He only checked the events related to Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Satisfy pet contest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Satisfy swimming competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Satisfy fighting competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Did Grid decide to participate in any events?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After the short meeting, Doohyun asked the question he really wanted to know.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Principle Lee Cheongsun’s eyes darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"He isn’t participating in any events. I sent him a request to attend the festival, but he rejected it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doohyun was embarrassed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he was Grid, he would’ve wanted to raise his sister’s status by attending events at the school, so it was surprising that he wasn’t.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Priorities need to be separated... Indeed, Grid’s nature is suitable to be Noe’s master. I have to learn from him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doohyun misunderstood and asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ruby... No, did Miss Sehee decide to participate in any events?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Look here. The fighting competition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was surprising.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He expected her to participate in the pet contest or swimming competition, but it was the fighting competition?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Anyway, this was the schedule. He would naturally approach Sehee and then get to know Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doohyun made up his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I &nbsp;also want to participate in the fighting competition. Ah, the pet contest...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doohyun enjoyed Satisfy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">On days when he wasn’t busy, it wasn’t unusual for him to play with his pet dog or play Satisfy. He had mentioned it a few times in interviews.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most people would think he was just doing something he liked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘How cute will the kids in the pet contest be?'</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Dugun dugun.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">His heart beat in anticipation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Doohyun’s face was much more attractive than usual. Principle Lee Cheongsun, who was 60 years old this year, couldn’t help feeling attracted.</span></p>
