 <p><span style="">“Linked Kill Wave.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kukukukung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A thunderous sound burst from Grid’s sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the strongest skill, which cast Kill eight times continuously and attached the features of Wave to it, Linked Kill Wave.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The momentum and strength was legendary.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The new skill fusion has succeeded.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your intelligence has increased by 10 due to the successful fusion of a new skill.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Linked Kill Wave is added to the list of Pagma’s Swordsmanship techniques.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Linked Kill Wave]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Performs three sword dances simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Summons eight consecutive Kill attacks that inflicts 1,500% attack power, chasing all objects within a 2m radius.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The targets hit will have all speeds reduced by 50%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* This skill doesn’t share a cooldown with Link, Kill, and Wave.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Mana Cost: 2,000</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 20 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a targeted skill that dealt up to 12,000% damage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Depending on the number of targets, it could be used as a single or wide area skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The three combination skill was several times stronger than the two combination skill, and the utilization was also high. It was truly a legendary skill.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The fierce momentum of Linked Wave Kill shot towards the clone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At first glance, it seemed to be Grid’s victory.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But what about the clone?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Just as Grid summoned Randy to deal with Linked Kill Wave, the clone could use the same method.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kyaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The clone’s Randy was hit by Linked Kill Wave instead, turning him to grey.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s eyes looked all over the place.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Where?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Randy’s ‘Change Locations with the Copied Target’ was similar to Teleport.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Depending on where Randy was when switching positions with the target, he could aim for the enemy’s blind spot.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid nervously looked around with the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A menacing aura of hatred and killing intent filled the air.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The clone was using Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid determined that it was difficult to avoid or defend against and used a skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Freely Move.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the skill attached to the title ‘Secret Hero.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were limits to the range of use, and the cooldown time was one hour. However, it was a top dashing skill that allowed him to avoid all non-targeting skills until he reached his target.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Suuk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">He avoided Kill and at the same time, leapt towards the clone and used Pinnacle.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Blood spurted from the clone’s chest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the clone didn’t shrink back.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pinnacle had the advantage of being a targeted skill, but the power was less than Kill. It was difficult to inflict death on the clone who was armed with all types of items.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid defended against the clone’s counterattack.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Since both sides had equal stats, no one was overwhelmed in a frontal battle. A tense contest began.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kikik!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kkikikik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid exchanged blows with Grid’s Greatsword and provoked the clone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why don’t you use Pinnacle Kill? Won’t it be hard to beat me without that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The clone didn’t say anything.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The clone was Grid, but it capabilities were confined. The clone was a puppet doll without feelings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reason for the clone’s existence was to kill Grid, so it had no thoughts or comments.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Magic Missile."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Magic Missile."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid and the clone looked at each other through interlocking swords and fired Magic Missiles, both of them flying back with damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This time, we did it simultaneously.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was satisfied.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Previously, he hadn’t been able to use Magic Missile first and was one-sidedly hit.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pa pa pa pat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Four golden hands appeared behind the clone’s back.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the copied God Hands.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were armed with the Ideal Dagger, the Doppelganger’s Greatsword, Failure, and Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid also summoned the God Hands.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was truly spectacular.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Four golden hands holding weapons were behind Grid and the clone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Someone who could use five weapons at the same time. It was a nonsensical fraudulent character from the point of view of an ordinary person.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘How can I take advantage of God Hands in this situation?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reason Grid didn’t take out the God Hands was because it wasn’t useful.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What would happen if he took out the God Hands?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The clone would just use his God Hands to neutralize it, and it would eventually become a one-on-one match again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Cheook!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Did the clone want to prove Grid’s thoughts wrong?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The clone started to actively make use of the God Hands.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Hwiririk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Wheel formation?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The God Hands formed a circular shape and rotated, wielding the weapons one after another at Grid’s God Hands.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rise and fall. Rise and fall.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The effect of the wheel formation, which didn’t have any breaks between attacks, was amazing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s God Hands were completely overwhelmed and made obsolete.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is possible!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The commands that Grid gave to the God Hands were simple.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was classified as attack, defense and waiting.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He only gave detailed commands when he wanted them to grab onto something.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because Grid didn’t have the ability to concentrate while giving more complex commands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Think about it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Focusing on battle while giving complex commands to four God Hands?&nbsp;</span><span style="">An ordinary person couldn’t do it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, the clone was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had the same stats as Grid, but was optimized for battle. Since he only existed to hurt Grid, his concentration was extremely excellent.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The clone’s God Hands kept rotating.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s God Hands were attacked with no time difference and they stiffened in order, then the clone’s God Hands flew towards Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Of course, the God Hands couldn’t threaten Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The wheel formation?&nbsp;</span><span style="">How funny.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The God Hands only had level 2 intermediate Sword Mastery, so Grid was able to shake them off with no difficulty.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the problem was the time spent in the process.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The clone approached while Grid was dealing with the God Hands and used Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Link.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pipit!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pipipipipit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ku...ack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Blood splattered from Grid’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If the God Hands hadn’t lost their stiffness and flown over to defend him, Grid would’ve suffered unimaginable damage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid fired Magic Missile and retreated in order to drink a health potion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, there was no time to drink a potion because the clone’s God Hands attacked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Chaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was busy blocking the strikes of the God Hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Strong.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The difference in basic judgment ability and control was too great, despite the clone having the same stats and items.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ssik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A smile appeared on Grid’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was happy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He realized that he still had room to grow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have to try and improve the control of the God Hands.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After learning a new skill combination, now he could see the usefulness of the God Hands.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid grinned with joy as he commanded the God Hands to capture the fake ones.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At this time, the clone started to deploy Pinnacle Kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I must look.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s concentration became extremely high.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kkuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A stronger force was added to the God Hands holding the fakes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was testament to the fact that Grid’s order to ‘hold’ the God Hands was more elaborate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Pinnacle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The clone’s sword moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Pinnacle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid showed an extreme concentration as he followed the actions of the clone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The curved orbit of Pinnacle changed to a straight line.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid did the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The new skill fusion has succeeded.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your intelligence has increased by 10 due to the successful fusion of a new skill.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Pinnacle Kill is added to the list of Pagma’s Swordsmanship techniques.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Pinnacle Kill]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Performs two sword dances simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Deals 2,000% of your attack power to a specified target.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It changes the trajectory of the sword in the middle, making it hard to deal with.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* This skill doesn’t share a cooldown with Pinnacle and Kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Mana Cost: 2,000</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Health Consumed by Skill: 4,500</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 5 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ack...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the same time, blood poured from the nose and mouth of Grid and the clone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At the same time, both of them lost half their health.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They quickly raised their swords and made different choices.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The clone immediately used Linked Kill, while Grid summoned Noe to slow down the clone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The best demonic beast of hell has emerged! Nyahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe laughed as he appeared after a long time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But this laughter didn’t last long.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because Noe was hit by the clone’s Linked Kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kyaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe’s fur bristled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He got fresh air after a long time, but was surprised at instantly suffering a crisis.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But who was Noe?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The greatest demonic beast of hell, a memphis.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had the best speed in hell and the skill to minimize physical damage, Fluidization.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe barely escaped the second Linked Kill by using Fluidization.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The guy with a cute mouth barely escaped! Then he opened his mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the manifestation of the worst skill, Soul Ingestion, which take away half of the highest stats of the target.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe swallowed up the clone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The effect of Soul Ingestion will increase your strength by 1,408 for the next minute.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Power boiled up inside him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid paused as he was about to use Linked Kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Will the clone also be able to summon Noe?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now that his strength temporarily rose to 4,224, what if the clone summoned Noe and used Soul Ingestion?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The clone’s strength would increase dramatically.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid visualized the worst case scenario and couldn’t easily attacked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Stupid master! What nyang? Attack this guy! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe moved forward to deal a blow to the clone instead of his hesitating master.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But despite the use of Fluidization, it was difficult to deal a fatal blow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid heard Noe’s voice and rushed forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Linked Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was confused.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The clone didn’t resist the attack and allowed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why didn’t the clone summon Noe?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Did he read the question in Grid’s heart?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sticks admired Noe while explaining.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"A memphis is the most perfect creature after a dragon, except for their personality. Even the mysterious Behen Archipelago can’t reproduce a memphis.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If he had known this earlier, he would’ve summoned Noe from the beginning.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, if he did that, he might not have learned Linked Kill Wave and Pinnacle Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid smiled positively and opened up the distance as much as possible.</span></p>
