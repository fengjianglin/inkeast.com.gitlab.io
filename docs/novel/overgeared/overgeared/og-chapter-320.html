 <p><span style="">Chapter 320</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">What should he do if he encountered someone?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The nervous Youngwoo shot a movie for three minutes while taking out the trash bags.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He looked around every time he took a step, and occasionally took a low crawling posture. He hid behind a telephone pole whenever car lights approached.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was a former sergeant of the Republic of Korea army and was a reservist.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to this, he was able to return home safely after taking out the trash.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sigh... It was good that I went into the army.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had struggled during his days of active duty, but the things he learned during the army were really worthwhile. First of all, the army was a sacred duty.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo didn’t think it was a waste of time to go into the army. Rather, he took pride in it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His mother, who was peeling garlic in the living room, looked at him with confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why are you wearing a mask and sunglasses at night?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I have to do this because of a false accusation. I have to consider my body, so have Sehee take out the trash for a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Are you insane? False accusation? Consider your body?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His mother had a concerned expression on his face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo didn’t want his mother to be concerned and changed the topic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s a joke, a joke. I’ll help you with the garlic.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pak!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pa pa pa pat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo peeled the garlic at a great speed. It was a level that transcended the skill of his mother, who had been peeling garlic for 30 years.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His mother was astonished when she saw how quickly the white flesh of the garlic was revealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘My son is also talented!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo hadn’t done well since he was a child. He didn’t reveal any talents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">His mother always took it to heart. She felt sorry that her son had no talent, and she also felt guilty.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But now he had her ability to peel garlic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was thrilled that her son’s talent was belatedly discovered. It was to the point of tears. But he wasn’t particularly happy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">After dinner, Grid accessed Satisfy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He went to visit Irene as always.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She would give birth in 50 days, so Grid was motivated to whisper endearments to her and to maintain a faithful attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Dear husband, have a good day today.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjuk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Irene’s lips touching his cheek was softer and more thrilling than anything else in the world.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then a notification window flashed in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The child in the belly has felt the true love of the couple, increasing all stats by 1.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It happened for the first time in a while. It had been 10 days The rise in the child’s stats was constantly being repeated in a certain period of time. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A good start!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The road was clear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The confident Grid ran to the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“We greet the great sun of Reidan, Duke Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The young blacksmiths greeted him in unison. Khan also laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid responded to them, then closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Concentrate.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t delay. He recalled the structure of the hand that he had memorized and immediately triggered the creation skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Item Creation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[What item do you want to create?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Will it work?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Item Creation wasn’t an almighty skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A simple example was that Grid couldn’t create accessories.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid could only create items that were suitable for blacksmiths to produce.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Gulp.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid gulped nervously and replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hands. I want to create hands.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[...]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was silent for a while.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The system didn’t have a reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Is it impossible?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the worst case scenario.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moment Grid was going to frown with disappointment,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[It is hands, not gauntlets?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The notification window was different from usual. It was a more organic question.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Something is coming!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid sensed this was a prelude to a special event and nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right! I want to create hands! Hands based on mine!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[It is possible if you set the material as pavranium.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His morale started to rise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was delighted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He shouted with excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will set the material as pavranium!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttiring~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A cheerful sound was heard, and he couldn’t imagine what happened next.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have had the same idea as the legendary blacksmith Pagma.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The third class quest ‘What Pagma couldn’t Achieve’ has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[What Pagma couldn’t Achieve]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Difficulty: Class Quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">300 years ago, the legendary blacksmith created the strongest mineral called pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pavranium is a mineral with a transcendent performance, even above the god mineral adamantium. It is said that it &nbsp;would’ve never been completed without the knowledge of Great Magician Braham.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pagma was inspired.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was his desire to make something that even transcended the gods using the pavranium.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there was a clear limit to the quantity of pavranium, so Pagma had to think about how to use the pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At this time, he came up with the ‘God Hand.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Several golden hands that could demonstrate a dexterity equivalent to the legendary blacksmith!&nbsp;</span><span style="">With the God Hands, Pagma believed he could produce items in an area that he had never reached.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, he was unable to make the God Hands.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Human life was finite and Pagma was already old.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now you have reached the same idea as Pagma, so create and produce the God Hands.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Transcend the foundation set by Pagma by achieving the goal that Pagma couldn’t reach.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Conditions: Fully produce hands made of pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Reward: One of the hidden pieces of Pagma’s Descendant, ‘Sealed Abilities’ will open.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is as Braham said!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pagma existed 300 years ago. In addition, he was dying at that point.&nbsp;</span><span style="">So how did he appear in history 100 years ago?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid gradually started to accept Pagma’s existence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Perhaps a ghost... No, it’s useless to think about it now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was something he would naturally discover during the progression of his story quests.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid shook his head and focused on the challenge ahead of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I’ll do it!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was filled with a burning motivation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was confident after memorizing the shape and structure of a hand for three hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Please design the God Hand.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A blank blueprint appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid drew the structure he learned and a form that resembled his own hand. As a result, he was able to design a quality hand that exceeded his knowledge due to the Item Creation skill’s compensation effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[’Design: God Hand’ has been acquired!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">God Hand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The name itself was tremendous. The performance was obviously great just based on the name.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The blissful Grid smelted the pavranium. Then he used the Legendary Blacksmith’s Hammer to forge it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid focused silently. He didn’t let anything obstruct him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was quiet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">For Grid, the only things that existed in the world at present were the pavranium, the anvil, and the hammer. There was nothing else.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttaang - ttang -!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The hammer and Grid were no longer separate existences. They were fully joined. The hammer was Grid and Grid was the hammer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The body and hammer moved as one.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The pavranium gradually took the shape of the God Hands. The complex and delicate structure was recreated. A clear sound rang out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan and the young blacksmiths were impressed as they watched the golden hands being completed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your extreme concentration has activated the Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath has increased the effectiveness of your production items.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the end of a long work, Grid finally returned to reality. His eyes widened as he confirmed the result.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There is no possibility that I will lose today.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro didn’t doubt it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s level was beyond his expectations, but it still wasn’t a match for Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I’m sorry towards My Lord.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was growing quickly. But that was it. Grid hadn’t yet become a suitable candidate for the title of legend.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There is still a sky between you and me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A person’s skills couldn’t transcend that gap overnight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro recalled the battle from the day before and was confident that he could win against Grid today without any injuries.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk!</span></i> <i><span style="">Puk puk puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pa pa pa pat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">As Piaro was thinking, his hands moved without any rest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He quickly dug out the vegetables in no time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris and the Five Captains were amazed at the sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I want such a farmer in our territory!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was Chris’ desperate wish.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pedro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The territory ruled by the Giant Guild was different from the past.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Everything was trampled by the golem army, so they were currently in the process of rebuilding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Of course, the fields were also a mess, and it was impossible to produce food.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But what if they obtained a Piaro?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pedro’s crops would get better every quarter and the Giant Guild’s finances would rise. People would become motivated after getting food and the rate of the reconstruction would increase by several times.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sigh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris could only sigh.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was envious of Grid, who had a great number of named NPCs like Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Um, I should end it here today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro rose from his spot. He finished work three hours earlier than usual.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Are you going already? What about the sparring?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was Chris who talked to Piaro with extreme respect. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I have something important to do today. After finishing the field work, we will spar at night. I’ll see you later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The dirt-stained Piaro left the fields.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It must be huge if that old man, who is crazy about farming, left.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Maybe something happened with Overgeared?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Five Captains’ guesses were reasonable. Piaro usually cherished working in the fields. What happened that would make him leave early?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Follow him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris felt curious and followed Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro’s insight was so high that they had to be a considerable distance behind, but they were able to easily follow him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because Reidan’s population was low.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris and the Five Captains followed Piaro to a large smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were confused at the sight of Piaro confronting Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was armed with two greatswords and had a grim expression on his face, like he was planning to fight Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is there a feud between the two?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If so, was this a chance to recruit Piaro?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris was inwardly cheering with delight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This idiot doesn’t understand who he is facing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The other captains scoffed, except for Zirkan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid couldn’t beat Piaro, who defeated even them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Five Captains predicted that Grid would be killed with a hand plow in 10 seconds. They believed it was a natural result.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Because we were beaten!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After reaching the third advancement, the Five Captains were stronger than ever.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were aware of the level of Grid’s skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But what was the truth?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Five Captains watched the sight unfold before their eyes and couldn’t close their mouths.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris was also shocked. </span></p>
