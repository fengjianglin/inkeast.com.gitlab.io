 <p><span style="">Chapter 218</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style=""> "Lauel, Piaro, and Bland will help in the fields while I am in the smithy. Thank them for their help.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No, who are they?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel wanted Grid to introduce the two men.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But rather than introducing them, Grid spoke to the two men and asked them to work. Lauel thought it was absurd.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Then I’m going.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel called again, but Grid didn’t look back and left.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because it wouldn’t be fun to reveal Piaro’s identity immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'He will experience it directly. He will feel astonishment, admiration, and reverence. There are only a few name-grade NPCs in Satisfy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid imagined Lauel and the Overgeared members’ reactions after grasping Piaro’s identity as a great swordsman.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro would teach the Overgeared members and they would become more powerful.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘So insensitive.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel faced Piaro and Bland after Grid left.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He started awkwardly for a moment before observing the two people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He looked at the middle-aged Piaro standing next to Bland. Piaro was wearing dirty clothes that couldn’t even be used as rags, and a horrible stench came from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He was called Bland so he must be Earl Ashur’s son...’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel easily understood Bland’s identity, but the problem was Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘Who is this person? His physique is good but his condition is too bad.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had mentioned that he was accompanied by someone when he took Earl Ashur’s son as a hostage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he didn’t say who it was.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Disappointing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel hoped that Grid would bring someone with enormous talent to help, but did he just bring a slave over?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'He wasted nine days to bring someone like this here...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel was deeply disappointed. He wanted to make Grid aware of his position.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel didn’t let his inner emotions show as he as greeted the two people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I am Lauel, Grid’s chief of staff. I’m proficient in handling people. Can I hear your introductions?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel was active in the golem invasion and grew further on his way to the west, so he was now level 287.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was first in the qigong master rankings, but he introduced himself as ‘proficient in handling people.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I am Bland de Ian, the youngest son of Earl Ashur. I know a bit of magic and have some skill in the sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had poor magic ability compared to his father. In addition, his swordsmanship was at a baby’s level compared to Grid and Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, Bland introduced himself as a beginner despite having a high level.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro was even worse,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I am Piaro. I have nothing to introduce other than my name. I know how to use the sword, but I am still lacking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He hadn’t achieved the level of a sword saint yet, and thus, Piaro introduced himself as an average swordsman.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There is a reason why Grid gave them field work: they just aren’t useful anywhere else.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel had no expectations of Piaro and Bland’s fighting power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Well, a beggar is better than a freeloader.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He wasn’t very inspired, but Lauel nodded and handed rakes to the two men.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Use this to get rid of foreign matter in the ground such as stones, then prepare the land for planting seeds.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel was sure that they wouldn’t do the work properly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bland was a noble and wouldn’t want to work hard in the fields, while the slave Piaro was probably just hoping for a meal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Um, this is the farming equipment used by the common people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I never thought that I would hold a tool like this in my entire life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is also an experience.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will keep that in mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro and Bland talked amongst themselves, but Lauel showed no interest in their conversation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel pointed to the vast land as they marvelled over the rakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Clear this piece of land by the end of the day. If you don’t know how to do it, please ask the people nearby. If you can’t do it, then take a break. I don’t intend to force you to work.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Most of the 20,551 people of Reiden were engaged in clearing the wilderness. It was safe to assume that all those with the physical strength, regardless of age and sex, were working.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the efficiency fell too much, due to the lack of farming equipment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Putting together the farming equipment owned by the people and the ones currently produced by Khan, there was only around 3,000 tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">It meant that among the thousands of people working, only 3,000 were actually efficient. The rest of the people could only pick up the stones by hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In this situation, Lauel wasn’t certain that he should give the tools to Bland and Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He deliberately gave an absurd quota to Piaro and Bland.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wanted them to give up quickly so that the precious farming equipment wasn’t wasted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I gave them 10 times more work than the others, so they will give up quickly.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel left the two people and got to work.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dragon Claws.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Once Lauel used his skill, five sharp pillars rose from the ground before disappearing. Then around 50 pyeong of land was overturned at once (1 pyeong= around 32 square feet).&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel scraped all the foreign matter that emerged from the ground with the rake, before laying down the ground again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel was pleased.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Clearing 50 pyeong in an instant. He immediately moved to another place and repeated the same thing. He was doing the job of hundreds alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bland watched him silently before exclaiming.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Magic can be applied to clear the land quickly. I should give it a try.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bland was about to use magic when Piaro restrained him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why use magic for something that doesn’t need it? Do you want to miss this golden opportunity to do physical exercise?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bland realized his mistake and said,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I was too short-sighted.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Look over there.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro pointed to the people working hard and sweating.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"We must learn from them. New movements will be acquired and this will nourish your swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro and Bland started to observe the common people. They thoroughly grasped how to clear the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"How about it? Isn’t this training?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right. It places a severe burden on the waist, shoulders and knees. This was the first time my body has been so overworked.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This wasn’t exercise but labor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was new for Piaro and Bland, who were nobles.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They repeatedly moved their rakes with their disciplined bodies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an incredibly fast speed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Both of them had good physical skills and picked up the tricks from the ordinary people, so they finished Lauel’s ridiculous quota in just one and a half hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Lauel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘They are finally here.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel had been working hard using his skill and rake, so he was satisfied when he heard Piaro’s voice,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Was it tough? You must’ve suffered a lot. Then, go rest. Oh, please return the rakes as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro spoke to Lauel who didn’t look back at him,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why should we rest? I am here to report that we have finished our work. Is there anything more we can do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel doubted his ears and turned towards Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro was now completely covered in dirt. It was proof that he had been working hard.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But clearing a 500 pyeong sized land in just two hours?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel couldn’t believe it as he asked,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If you don’t mind, can I go and check it myself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro wasn’t offended. It was natural since this was the first time he did it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The usually calm Lauel let out a cry of surprise.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The 500 pyeong sized land that he entrusted to both Piaro and Bland really had been cleared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What type of magic was used?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel couldn’t close his mouth and Piaro prompted him,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Then, please give us the next task.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah, yes...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a lot of wilderness that needed to be cleared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel entrusted Piaro and Bland with another piece of land that was 500 pyeong. Then he watched both of them.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Buzz buzz.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The other Overgeared members quickly gathered in Lauel’s vicinity, all interested in the turmoil.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They folded their arms and watched Bland and Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The person who started work first was Bland.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Isn’t he quite good?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members let out sounds of admiration.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bland cleared the field 10 times faster than an average person, a speed comparable to when the Overgeared members used their skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members were able to predict that Bland’s strength and stamina were comparable to theirs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then what about the other person?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members focused on Piaro, who belatedly started after sufficient stretching.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then they were shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A professional farmer...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The speed at which Piaro cleared the field was 10 times faster than Bland.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t just a matter of good stamina.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had a perfect grasp of how to use the rake to overturn the ground more effectively.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His exquisite movements made the rake move through the ground like it was water. It was a godly skill that allowed all the foreign substances in the ground to be piled up in a corner.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hah...! Grid brought someone huge!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes. He brought a master of farming. With those skills, he is almost like a legendary farmer. We can’t be fooled by his appearance...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"But how did Grid know that we needed a farmer for Reidan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This Huroi! I am impressed with My Lord’s foresight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s transcendent senses detected the flow of water deep in the earth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He asked Lauel,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Does this place not have enough water connected to it right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right. We plan to connect more channels in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’ll take care of it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No matter how clever Lauel was, he couldn’t immediately understand Piaro’s remark.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel and the Overgeared members were feeling puzzled as Piaro pushed his rake deep into the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Suddenly, the earth started to shake as an intangible wave of energy was released.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"An earthquake all of a sudden...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel and the Overgeared members thought that a giant worm might pop up, while the residents were confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuwaaaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A sound echoed out from where Piaro was standing before a pillar of water exploded upwards, seemingly piercing the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wahhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The people cheered at the unbelievable sight while Lauel and the Overgeared members were shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was the gurgle of water as Piaro wiped the water and dirt off his face before saying,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is a good plot of land.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro was clever and talented, so he was the best at whatever he did.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the moment when the great swordsman became known as a legendary farmer and legendary feng shui person.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On this day, there was a festive atmosphere in Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A precious source of water had been found in the land that had been turned into a wilderness, so the people laughed, cried, and wept.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the same time.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“How sad, I can’t even rest and have to work immediately after being overworked in a week-long monster hunt...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid, Duke of the Eternal Kingdom and Lord of Reidan, was fiercely hammering in front of the roaring blast furnace.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His rank was the highest, but he was also the busiest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was normal.</span></p>
