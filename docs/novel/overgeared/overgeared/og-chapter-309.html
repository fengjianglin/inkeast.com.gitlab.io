 <p><span style="">Chapter 309</span></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">"The Violet Guild is famous for their excellent raid skills. A month ago, they raided the Rotten Horned Rayon. They couldn’t compete with Tallos’ strength, but you succeeded with just Magic Missile and Fireball. Please give us an explanation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The questions of the excited reporters continued.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was troubled because some of the questions were are sharp as knives.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Rumors might spread that I am a bugged user, or that the S.A. Group is supporting me from the rear.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Based on the experience he gained, Tallos was far more powerful than Pascal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was impossible for a user to kill him alone, especially with just basic magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was troubled by the suspicious reporters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I don’t think you understand me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham borrowed Grid’s mouth and started to chatter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I am a legend. I am omnipotent. Trivial beings like you can never imagine, let alone understand me. It is normal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reporters were shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At this moment, Grid was beyond arrogance...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chuunibyou">Chuunibyou</a>!’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was calling himself omnipotent with a serious expression? It was also in front of dozens of cameras!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid wanted to curl his hands in shame.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘How embarrassing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid used to be a chuunibyou. But at the age of 27, Grid met the chuunibyou Lauel and was able to overcome it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, the 28 year old Grid had a stigma towards being called a chuunibyou.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Braham, please act more moderately for me!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was thankful for gaining a level, but that was it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t know how to get rid of the mess that Braham had entangled him in.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As Grid was feeling troubled, Braham used Teleport and left the reporters behind.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“13 minutes ago in real time, the guild master of Overgeared, Grid, destroyed the First Servant of Yatan with Magic Missiles and Fireball.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Tallos, Yatan’s First Servant, is a fourth advancement black magician, and even Violet’s group failed in the raid. Grid killed him with basic magic, so his strength is beyond common sense...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“People all over the world are raising suspicions that Grid is a bugged player. The S.A. Group has issued an official position that this isn’t the case. However, the suspicions of users isn’t fading. There’s a conspiracy theory that there is some type of deal between Grid and the S.A. Group.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The international media covered the Grid incident.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Of course, the public opinion wasn’t good.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most people were suspicious of Grid’s overwhelming strength. There was a lot of speculation on SNS.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then the experts from various fields stabilized public opinion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid is likely doing a story-driven quest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Story-driven quest? Ah, you are talking about the ‘Bring Chocolate to the Mother Wolf’ type of quest?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Correct. A typical quest that occurs only when the user meets certain conditions. A story-driven quest is often to ‘experience something.’ A typical example is ‘Bring Chocolate to the Mother Wolf’ quest that most of us would’ve experienced in the early days.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bring chocolate to the mother wolf.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a quest acquired at level 8.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The user who accepted the quest wouldn’t be able to control their body, as they turned into a young wolf and brought chocolate to the mother wolf. The user’s role was just to observe the story of the wolf and appreciate it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid’s appearance and tone are different from usual. The fact that he also easily handled a named boss is proof that it isn’t Grid. It is likely that he is experiencing something very special.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That’s right. However, who is that special being?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">South Korea, the United States, France, Canada, Russia, China, Japan and so on.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The international experts came up with a common thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Braham Eshwald.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The legendary great magician.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After that, the portal sites around the world became dominated by articles about Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The legendary blacksmith, Grid! He is experiencing what is it like to be a legendary great magician!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Is a great magician the second class that Grid will acquire?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The arrogance of a talented and handsome man is charming? Women all over the world are raving over the white haired Grid!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Grid’s arrogant way of talking is trending on SNS... It’s likely to become a social problem.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The popularity of Grid in Japan, the origin of chuunibyou, is huge! Is this the advent of the 5th Korean wave?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The number of Grid’s fan club members have doubled in 3 hours... The advertisements are soaring.]</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It would’ve become a mess by now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid sighed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was afraid of the aftermath of Braham’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I saw the reporters’ faces. Their reactions were disgust.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He could easily imagine how they would write the articles.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid chuunibyou, Grid is arrogant, Grid is bugged, Grid is crazy, and so on.&nbsp;</span><span style="">All types of malicious articles would spread on the Internet, and he would gain millions of anti-fans.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I am probably taking over the real time search words...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was afraid to log out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Knowing his bad luck, he might be chased around the streets.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Should I hire bodyguards?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How long would his suffering last?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had no idea of the actual situation and was feeling frustration, while Braham scoffed as he moved through the Ludhadan Cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Amoract, you are as careful as Mother said.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The level of the veil placed over the cave was considerable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘But it isn’t at a level to mislead me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid asked as Braham moved deeper into the cave without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"By the way, who is Amoract?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why did he need to hide himself behind a representative?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Braham’s answer was simple and concise.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The great demon of conflict.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Great demon...! The First Servant of Yatan is a great demon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was completely shocked by the unexpected answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Surely you don’t mean to fight a great demon right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The Amoract here isn’t in a perfect state. It’s just a part of Amoract’s soul, so there’s no need to feel scared. A soul fragment is helpless against me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A great demon wasn’t his opponent. It was like he was declaring that a great demon wasn’t tough.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The deepest part of the dark cave.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was a white soul floating above an altar in the center of a large space.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You came.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soul greeted Braham. The response was as if it had been waiting for Braham.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Braham borrowed Grid’s mouth and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Amoract, you were aware that I would look for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Of course. I know you need the blessing of the gods to get rid of your mortality.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If my guess is correct, you’re going to listen to my demands?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[That’s right.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kukukuk, Marie Rose must be pretty annoying to Yatan.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Marie Rose?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a familiar name to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A vampire duke who showed absolute dignity.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A chill went down Grid’s spine as he recalled her existence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If she’s somewhere in the vampire cities...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It would’ve been impossible to obtain all the pavranium.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was fortunate that he accepted Braham’s soul to complete the quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[God Yatan favors you, regardless of Marie Rose. Always remember this.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"He isn’t a god.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[...Be careful with your mouth.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Amoract’s sweet voice hardened. It was a level of intimidation that made Grid’s chest tighten.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Braham wasn’t agitated at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Shouldn’t you step foot on this land before trying to intimidate me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[It isn’t about intimidation, but manners.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I won’t show courtesy to Yatan. I don’t serve him anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Anymore?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Did this mean Braham once served Yatan?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had doubts, but it wasn’t a question that could be resolved at this time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Braham ordered Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Take out the pavranium.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have temporarily gained control of your body.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The notification window popped up and Grid regained his freedom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Now I got a little taste.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t pleasant to give up control of his body to others.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid felt peace of mind as he summoned Lifael’s Spear. Then Braham commanded Amoract.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Now give it Yatan’s blessing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[I don’t like it but... Okay. This is the will of God Yatan.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Amoract’s white soul grew bigger and bigger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then after a short period of time, a dark beam fell from the ceiling.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Lifae’s Spear was struck by the dark light and shook.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the notification windows were updated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[God Yatan’s blessing has fallen on the pavranium.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Pavranium has gained the ability to increase magic power.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Goddess Rebecca’s blessing boosted recovery speed, God Dominion’s blessing increased attack power and God Judar’s blessing increased defense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">These blessings were always applied to Grid, who was the owner of the pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had been expecting a lot from God Yatan’s blessing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the magic power buff was disappointing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Magic power wasn’t very important since Grid couldn’t just magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No, no.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Given that he would learn one spell from Braham, it wasn’t so bad that his magic power increased.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid thought about it positively, while Braham was feeling thrilled. Their souls were assimilated so Grid could feel his intense joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Finally...! The time has finally come!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The resurrection that he had been desiring for hundreds of years.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The excited Braham shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Now Pagma's Descendant! Make the Vessel of the Soul!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham’s dubious elements weren’t important to Grid right now.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid just wanted the enormous rewards from Braham.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid stripped a small amount of pavranium from Lifael’s Spear and made a small bowl.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a bowl that seemed somewhat rough, but the craftsmanship of the maker could be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kukukuk! Kuahahaha!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham’s soul left Grid’s body and moved to the Vessel of the Soul.</span></p>
