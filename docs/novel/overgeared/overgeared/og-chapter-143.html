 <p><span style="">Chapter 143</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">?????</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The combat power displayed above the Awakened Guardian of the Forest’s head was made of only question marks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If this were Grid from a few months back, he wouldn’t have been able to guess why and probably would’ve thought it as a bug and grumbled about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, now he was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After many incidents, Grid had calmed and matured almost to the point of unfamiliarity.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His thinking power finally belonged to the category of normal people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is this implying that its combat power is too high for my insight?’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ah, is my scouting broken? &nbsp;What’s with your immeasurable combat strength?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was reminded of a scene from an old manhwa.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His insight had worked on the pope, so this meant that the guardian in front of him was stronger than the pope.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“How rotten... I came here to play but I met a strong enemy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had defeated the pope and obtained the legendary battle gear set, so he was much stronger than before.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had planned to easily defeat the Guardian of the Forest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then what was this awakening mode?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid wasn’t aware of why the Guardian of the Forest awakened and why it was at this time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he didn’t panic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He thought about it calmly and positively.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It will be a tough fight, but I think that it will work out well. Doesn’t it seem like the guardian will give a lot of blue orichalcum?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The ash grey forest couldn’t dim the light of the blue orichalcum on the awakened guardian’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he could obtain all those blue orichalcum, wouldn’t he be able to make two Failures?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will collect it!’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid wanted to take out a pickaxe. However, he needed to first neutralize the guardian.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘I can’t be too excited or I might miss the jackpot. Let’s not attack carelessly and wait for a chance.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was a greatsword lover.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Except for the Ideal Dagger that he made for a quest, he had always used a greatsword since starting Satisfy until now.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was confident that he had a higher understanding of a greatsword than most users did.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">All out power! Deadly blows!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Phew.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid grasped Dainsleif tightly and took deep breaths.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He waited for a moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The awakened guardian stared at Grid, then a red light flashed in its eyes. It made a posture like a sprinter, then quickly narrowed the distance towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid timed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘One. Two. Now!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was perfect timing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As soon as the awakened guardian ran into Dainsleif’s attack range, Grid released all his tensed muscles.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">An explosive sword strike!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dainsleif caused a dark red afterglow as it accurately struck the guardian’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 5,700 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The awakened guardian’s health gauge was reduced around 1/100.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was convinced.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Just like the size is several times smaller than the original, its defense and health are reduced as well.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Monster types could be divided into the main categories of: &nbsp;attack, defense, support, and balance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">While it was possible to classify them in more detail depending on species, attributes, skill, etc, these were just the basics.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Guardian of the Forest was a typical defensive monster. As a peak golem, it possessed both abnormally high defense and health.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, the Awakened Guardian of the Forest was undoubtedly an offensive monster.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was obvious that it was an aggressive monster when its health was reduced by 1/100 by a single blow, as well as the fact that it killed a knight instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The advantages are its fast speed and high attack power.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was a good thing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid could exert overwhelming attack power, so he found it more comfortable to deal with offensive types compared to defense types.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was possible to take care of the opponent quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will kill you in an instant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The awakened guardian was stronger than the pope?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was also stronger than the pope.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s eyes were filled with confidence. But he still remained calm.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His head was cold while his chest was hot.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t move first. He waited for another chance, just like before.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Indeed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As an offensive type monster, the awakened guardian was aggressive. It didn’t learn and aimed for a frontal attack again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Now!'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid calculated the perfect timing for a counter.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He swung Dainsleif the moment the awakened guardian entered his range of attack.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">This time, it was a vertical slash.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The heavier blow fell upon the guardian’s shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 6,380 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kik.</span></i> <i><span style="">Kkikikik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The awakened guardian was hit and let out a strange noise. It paused for a moment before heading directly to him again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Hehe, you idiot. Is your IQ in the single digit~?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, Grid believed that his IQ was in the double digits!&nbsp;</span><span style="">He prepared for the third counter.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He once again swung Dainsleif with proper timing. But this time, there was a completely different result.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The same move no longer worked. The awakened guard avoided the attack by moving its upper body the moment Grid struck. Then it moved around Dainsleif towards Grid’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The same stupid lunge was a fake?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A chill went down Grid’s spine.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A monster using a trick!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the guardian rotated, gathering the centrifugal force before kicked Grid’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have been hit by a lethal blow!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 13,090 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuheok...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This wasn’t a skill. It was just a kick. In other words, a simple blow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Except, that “simple blow” made him instantly lose a third of his health.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was twice the damage that Grid could deal with his critical attacks. Considering Grid was also equipped with legendary equipment, it was a stunning sight to behold.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The effect of Doran’s Ring has been activated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The option of the Holy Light Armor has been activated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[19,635 health has been restored.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Damn bastard!” </span></p>
 <p><span style="">The broken nose bone was restored and the nosebleed disappeared without a trace.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid’s anger didn’t fade.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Falling for a monster’s tricks? Grid didn’t expect to be so stupid!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Grid fired Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Link.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pipit!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pipipipipi-!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">17 swords of light covered the awakened guardian’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it didn’t do much damage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The awakened guardian surprised him by avoiding nine of the strikes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Fast!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid panicked as the guardian leapt into the air like a martial artist and evaded. Then it flew above Grid’s head and its heel descended.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid hurriedly defended.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[The durability of +5 Dainsleif (Reproduction) has been reduced by 37.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘As expected from the blue orichalcum!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dainsleif was made of black iron, one of the finest minerals, and the durability hadn’t been damaged until now!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Except for adamantium, its body was composed of blue orichalcum, which was known as one of the best minerals.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’ll kill you! I will tear your body to shreds! Blacksmith's Rage!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t shrink back. Rather, the momentum around him became stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Blacksmith’s Rage has been activated. Your attack power and attack speed will increase significantly for 20 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Chaeeeeeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The onslaught of the excited Grid began.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The awakened guardian defended by crossing its arms.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s attack speed after Blacksmith’s Rage was used was so fast that the guardian couldn’t counterattack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid kept up this momentum.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Wave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was impossible for the awakened guardian to defeat against the waves being emitted in every direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 10,300 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The target’s attack speed has reduced.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The awakened guardian stumbled like its body suddenly became heavier. It quickly corrected its posture but it was already too late.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid accumulated a lot of combat experience and he wasn’t going to miss this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuoooooh-!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A powerful killing intent filled and suppressed the air.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Romeo and the soldiers watching the battle from the bushes were scared, urinated or fainted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The awakened guardian also flinched in response.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It perceived great danger from the black energy around Grid’s greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The awakened guardian struck the ground with its feet. Then the earth suddenly started to vibrate.&nbsp;</span><span style="">One of the AOE skills possessed by the Guardian of the Forest could also be used in its awakened form.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was immune to status conditions, but what about when the entire earth was shaking?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He lost his balance. The subtle collapse of his posture dropped the accuracy of Kill significantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your attack has missed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Damn!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His strongest move had missed?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was shaken. Then the guardian, who avoided Kill, started to fight back as it struck Grid’s body with both fists.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The number of blows was higher than Link.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The fists that could even crush steel slammed into Grid. It was the sight of a full-scale beating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“V-Viscount Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soldiers screamed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The volcanic ash blown by the wind pressure interfered with their sight, but they thought that Grid was being turned into a rag.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We have to help. Our savior... He will die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jude jumped to his feet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Romeo stopped him before he could go forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Viscount Grid is safe! We will just interfere!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Romeo’s words were true.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At first glance, Grid seemed to be standing firmly on the ground. He never collapsed, despite being hit by the awakened guardian’s strike dozens of times.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Meanwhile, the awakened guardian stopped punching. It seemed to think Grid was dead.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, reality was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Golden discs were flashing from within the ashes?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The golden discs appeared in front of the guardian.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kikik!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The awakened guardian belatedly noticed that it had been the golden discs that it had been hitting so far.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It nervously kicked out at the discs.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then it flinched again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It kicked with all its power, but the golden discs floating in the air didn’t even move.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...You.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The two golden discs swirled and moved in different directions. Then it was revealed that Grid didn’t receive even one wound.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Did you avoid my attack using such a shallow method? Are you pretending to be a smart golem? Huh? Damn bastard.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Float.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s body rose in the air.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This wasn’t a temporary rise.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the ‘Fly’ magic attached to Braham’s Boots.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Romeo and the soldiers were in a daze.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Heok! The viscount can use magic?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I don't know!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Romeo was confused.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He heard from Earl Steim that Grid was Pagma’s Descendant, so how could he use magic?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was also senior magic!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Does that mean Pagma could use magic? Or is Pagma’s Descendant an existence that transcends Pagma...!’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a disturbance from the side and the awakened guard jumped as high as possible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It had planned to grab a hold of Grid before he escaped. But the attempt failed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The height that the guardian could jump was 4m. Grid had already flown above 5m.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid scoffed,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Try to trigger another earthquake, you stupid bastard. It is useless to trigger an earthquake when I’m in the sky."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A person in the sky had an advantage over those on the ground!&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the grey sky, Grid started dancing among the volcanic ash that was like snow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s sword dance usually lasted from 1.5 to 3 seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But this sword dance lasted two times longer than that.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was natural.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was because he was using two sword dances in succession.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Transcend, Link.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The new skill fusion has succeeded.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Fusion skill ‘Transcended Link’ has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your intelligence has increased by 10 due to the successful fusion of a new skill.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Transcended Link]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A sword dance that transcends imagination and is more dazzling than a butterfly’s wings.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You will temporarily be in a transcended linked state.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A total of 20 strikes will be launched, dealing 150% attack power with each hit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Every time a target is hit, they will be stiff for 0.1 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* This skill doesn’t share a cooldown with Transcend and Link.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Mana Cost: 1,600</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 15 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was simple.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If he switched to a ranged mode with Transcend to double his attack power, then used Link, the original 800% attack power of Link would be doubled by the ranged attack. He thought it would be effective, so he connected the two skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, the actual result was a skill fusion and its power was beyond imagination.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwakwakwakwakwakwakwakwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The deepest part of the Grey Forest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was an outpouring of black energy swords in the sky of forest where the Guardian of the Forest had lived for hundreds of years.</span></p>
