 <p><span style="">Chapter 210</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Most of the magic formulas used by magicians today were established by Braham.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to Braham, the science of magic was able to develop and the authority of magicians rose. For magicians, Braham was a teacher and object of respect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But what was the truth?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Braham’s achievements that people knew about actually belonged to Mumud.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The person who simplified complicated magic formulas, made it easier for training, and spread it into the world was Mumud, not Braham.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then why was Mumud unknown, and Braham praised by the world?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Braham was the only one who knew.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Golem’s Labyrinths.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You ignored my warning. Pagma's Descendant, you are the first person to make me so angry after Mumud.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham was furious at Grid, who didn’t respond to his message.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His 28 souls twisted like they were flames in front of the wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[I will make you regret it.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the past, Mumud was Braham’s best disciple.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Mumud’s talents grew day by day and would eventually transcend him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Braham couldn’t tolerate it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t let his top position be taken by his disciple, so he monitored Mumud’s every move.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s how the ‘Eyes of Surveillance’ magic was attached to Mumud’s Orb.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[I will find out your weakness.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had reproduced Mumud’s Orb for Euphemina, allowing him to be watched. The day would come when Grid would eventually move according to Braham’s will.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Deep in the forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You’re finally here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A man with matted hair was waiting when Grid logged in.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Great Swordsman Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was seated in front of a campfire and Grid greeted him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Good morning. Have you eaten?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s attitude towards Piaro was very friendly. It was much more favorable than when he dealt with beautiful people like Yura and Jishuka.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Piaro was unfriendly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I ate. Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s smile didn’t go away.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was happy at the thought of having the strongest swordsman as his colleague.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If Piaro becomes a sword saint...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He would have unsurpassed power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t need to be afraid of demons like Hell Gao anymore. Maybe he could try raiding a dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is enough for now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Strength, stamina, agility.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If these three combat related stats were combined, Piaro had higher stats than Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro also had the strongest skills as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was very reassuring to Grid. But there was one drawback.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘His appearance is deplorable.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It might be due to his sickness of the heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro looked so old that it was hard to believe he was 29 years old. It was more believable if he was 50 years old.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s a matter of style.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His shabby attire and shaggy hair made him look like a homeless person. He had a scruffy beard and he stank.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Appearance is important.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid once had the worst appearance, so he knew the importance of appearance better than anyone else.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wasn’t he despised by other people just because he was ugly or because of his clothes?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid determined that it wasn’t good to leave Piaro as he was and pulled clothes out of his inventory.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was noble clothing that he received from Irene.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was hesitant because it was an item worth 50 gold, but he closed his eyes and handed it to Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Put this on. And why don’t you cut or tie your hair up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro refused.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I don't care about my appearance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I'm embarrassed to go around with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was something his sister often said to him. Grid felt a flash of understanding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is how Sehee felt.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid smiled bitterly as Piaro responded bluntly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You have to endure it if you want me to come with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ah...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s nerves were sharp. Anger was the only thing that could be seen in both eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because he was obsessed with revenge.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As stated in the status window, Piaro was currently suffering from a sickness of the heart and lost his original nature.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid felt the need to take care of him. Rather than forcing or persuading him, Grid would let him do as he wanted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the best and smartest choice for Grid, who had little experience with building up relationships with people.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Grrr.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A pair of twin ogres appeared in front of the two people who had been walking for half a day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were powerful level 260 monsters, but they were nothing more than puppies in front of the legendary Grid and Great Swordsman Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It only took Piaro a matter of seconds.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeeeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid took around one minute to destroy his twin ogre.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro asked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I felt it when we fought the other day, but your basics are terrible. You can implement Pagma’s wonderful techniques, but you haven’t mastered the sword."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had been using a greatsword as a weapon since Satisfy began. He might not be the best, but he was confident that he knew the basics.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, considering his experience and level, it was true that he lacked skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid became aware of it because of Piaro and gave an excuse.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I don't care about swordsmanship. Anyway, I am armed with excellent weapons and armor. If I rely on my equipment, I can overpower my opponent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That is wrong for warriors. Moreover, it’s bad to just rely on equipment if your equipment isn’t suitable.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro pointed to Braham’s Boots.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“If you really want to rely on equipment, you should change those shoes first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The defense of Braham’s Boots were outstanding considering they had a level 240 limit. Moreover, it was light and comfortable to wear, speeding up movement speed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was nothing compared to Failure or the Holy Light set, but it was a worthy item because Fly was attached to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid sent him a glance stating ‘you don’t know anything,’ so Piaro explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The greatsword emphasizes power over swiftness. In order to put as much weight as possible behind your strikes, you should wear sturdy shoes that can withstand the weight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid wasn’t smart. If he heard an explanation when he wasn’t prepared in advance, he was slow to understand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro gave him a more direct explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If you wear heavy boots, it is easier to concentrate your weight and you can gain more power behind your strikes. So I recommend heavy boots.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘So... Wearing heavy boots will increase the attack power of the greatsword?’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was delighted after successfully interpreting it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘I found a hidden system!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid &nbsp;was thrilled about finding a hidden system that most people didn’t know about. Named NPCs could give all sorts of specific advice. His liking towards Piaro increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will be able to get ahead of others.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t know.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If a heavy weapon user was armed with heavy boots, the system would given additional attack power. This was already common sense to most users.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It showed that Grid was still ignorant when it came to overall game knowledge.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is this Patrian?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After a three day journey, Grid and Piaro arrived at Patrian.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The fortified city, Patrian.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a strategic point at the border of the Gauss Kingdom, while also establishing the boundary that separated the western and northern parts of the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In addition, it was Grid’s starting city.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I lived here for nearly a year...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid not only hunted countless orcs and goblins around Patrian, he also cleared all types of quests.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to that, he was able to maximize his affinity with all the residents of Patrian, and received Earl Ashur’s quest, where he eventually became Pagma’s Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That bastard Ashur...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid gritted his teeth as he once again recalled Earl Ashur. He was forced to become Pagma’s Descendant due to Earl Ashur, and he trembled as he recalled his days as a minus level.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘...I vowed that I would get revenge once I became stronger.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had been filled with fury towards Earl Ashur for a while.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But that was the past.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Due to his relationship with Earl Ashur, he ended up benefiting.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“We will stay here today and leave tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At this speed, they could arrive in Reidan in four days.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The relaxed Grid entered Patrian with Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that moment, Earl Ashur’s magic detected Grid’s presence.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He checked Grid’s identity through the magic spheres he installed throughout Patrian and rose to his feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“He isn’t afraid of this place...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Ashur had dreamt about getting revenge on Grid, after losing Pagma’s Rare Book in front of his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He immediately summoned his knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“We’re going hunting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a great opportunity to repay the grudge.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Ashur was overcome with joy, despite being aware of Grid’s importance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He knew that Grid had become a duke, but he didn’t care.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“This meal tastes terrible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Patrian was a fortified city, not a tourist one. Therefore, it didn’t have a system designed to care for outsiders. The accommodations they found didn’t have proper facilities.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro looked at Grid, who was complaining about the cheap inn’s poor meal, and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why are you hiding your identity?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid said he was a duke of the kingdom. If this was true, he should be treated with great hospitality by the owner of the city.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yet Grid hid his identity with a hat before entering the city. It was like he was a wanted person, rather than a duke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid explained to the suspicious Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"We are only staying overnight, and I don’t want to be bothered.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hrmm...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Well, Grid’s actions didn’t matter. Piaro only cared about his revenge.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro thought so and tilted his glass. It was cheap alcohol, but this was the first time he could drink in two years.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, the users were looking at Grid and Piaro with strange expressions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s a strange combination.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why are those two together?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was dressed in his beginners clothing to conceal his identity, while Piaro seemed like a beggar.&nbsp;</span><span style="">People recognized Grid as a beginner, and Piaro as a beggar NPC. They were puzzled about why an NPC would be with a beginner.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No matter how cheap the food here is, it would be somewhat burdensome for a beginner to afford... How can he buy drinks as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The smell is too much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Really annoying. What is that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The female users found the odor coming from Piaro annoying. The male users saw the female users’ reactions and came forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hey, Beggar. I don’t know why a poor person is trying to get drunk, but can you stop disturbing the other guests with your rancid smell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The ladies have lost their appetite because of you. Get lost.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the first place, users didn’t care about NPCs. It was natural for the treatment to be worse when the NPC was a beggar.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro ignored them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid didn’t care.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The two men weren’t worth dealing with, so he just enjoyed his food and drink.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The steamed lizardmen tails are good to eat. They’re similar to pig trotters.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What are pig trotters? I’ve tasted all types of delicacies in the empire, but I’ve never heard of such a dish.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It is delicious pig’s feet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hah~ the beggar is ignoring us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The level 109 Coke became angry at being ignored by the beggar and eventually committed a mistake.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His hand moved like he was about to do something.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro didn’t allow it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He spat out the bone of the lizardman tail that he was eating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eek.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 3,190 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Coke’s eyes widened as he screamed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because he was hit in the forehead by a bone and lost more than a third of his health.</span></p>
