 <p><span style="">Chapter 293</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Elfin Stone woke up!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then he found Grid’s party today.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had killed one human every day for the past three days.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, it was strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Isn’t there the same number as yesterday?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This time he wasn’t mistaken. He counted yesterday, so he knew the exact number.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The number of humans hadn’t decreased.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone questioned as he looked at Grid’s group.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was to find out if the person he thought he killed yesterday was alive or not.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But just as humans had difficulty distinguishing between beasts, vampires had difficulty distinguishing between humans.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Sniff sniff.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Sniff sniff!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone was unable to find Grid with his eyes, so he sniffed like a dog.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was looking for the smell of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'This guy!'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone’s gaze fixed on Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His air was rough, but he was a strong-looking fellow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In other words, he was definitely the one who Elfin Stone attacked yesterday.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, it wasn’t just yesterday, but the first and second day as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone’s eyes sank coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You, why are you still alive?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How did he survive Extreme Blood Transfusion for three days in a row?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He certainly wasn’t an ordinary guy. This was a good guy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It was a close call.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He almost missed a delicacy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t easy for him to realize that he almost destroyed good human blood.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was thankful for the human’s survival!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Should I try it once?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Step, step.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone felt a strong appeal from Grid and moved slowly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid shook nervously as Elfin Stone approached.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Your parents must’ve had a hard time after giving birth to you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Even the lowest of humans thought about their parents.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then what about the vampires who recognized themselves as superior to humans?&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, the True Blood considered their parent as a god.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Shizo Beriache.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was the one who gave them eternal life!&nbsp;</span><span style="">She wasn’t an existence that a mere human could disparage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This is the second time I have become so angry over the past 300 years!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The blood rose to Elfin Stone’s head. His face distorted in a terrible manner and he shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will feed on all of you today!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuwooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone released his overwhelming magic power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It hadn’t reached the level of a great demon, but it was several times stronger than the best rated demonkin.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was slightly above Hell Gao after his flesh was destroyed by Muller.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid and Peak Sword speculated from among the astonished party members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had fought with Hell Gao, so they could more accurately assess Elfin Stone’s strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is bad!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hell Gao had the fire stones weakness, but Elfin Stone was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid observed him with the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch, but he couldn’t grasp any weak points.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In other words, he was one of the high ranking bosses.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Shit!'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi’s aggro was too much.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He stimulated Elfin Stone more than necessary.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He knew he would be severely beaten up one day because he mentioned the parents, but...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why is it today?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid lamented, while Jishuka tried to encourage the party members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is fine! There’s a chance to win!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The first reason they were afraid of Elfin Stone was his attack the moment he appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a level of surprise they couldn’t cope with, and they had to assume that one person would die.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now the situation had changed. Elfin Stone was in front of them, so there was no need to fear a surprise attack.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If they built a good formation, there was a chance...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The group had to shake their heads when Elfin Stone showed a formidable appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Blood Field!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puhahahak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Magic power stretched out around Elfin Stone and dominated the land in a 30m radius.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s party was within it. To be precise, the party was adversely affected except for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your blood is influenced by Blood Field.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[153 health will be transferred to Earl Elfin Stone per second.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[All healing effects will be reduced by 80%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The people with the lowest health in the party were Jishuka, Zednos and Faker.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Archers, magicians and assassins all had around 20,000~30,000 health.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Losing 153 health per second was a huge pressure on them. They would lost two-thirds of their life in just two minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Furthermore, this health would also restore Elfin Stone?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It meant that Elfin Stone recovered 1,400 health per second.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Such a scam.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Fighting here means defeat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The party tried to escape from the area of Blood Field.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Elfin Stone wasn’t standing still.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Blood Requiem."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone swung both arms.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was reminiscent of the elegant actions of a conductor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then pillars of blood fell over the party members’ heads.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Blood Requiem!&nbsp;</span><span style="">It didn’t matter how many people were in the group.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Elfin Stone’s unique skill that attacked all enemies inside the Blood Field.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The damage was at least 10,000!&nbsp;</span><span style="">The wide area skill had incredible power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuack, how do we defeat that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I'm going crazy."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members coughed up blood and took potions to restore their health.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the 80% reduction in healing effects meant the potions weren’t effective.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid urgently summoned Noe and Randy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He planned to have Noe eat Elfin Stone’s stats and have Randy copy some of Elfin Stone’s skills to increase the odds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Noe and Randy couldn’t play a role.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I can’t swallow the souls of noble True Blood vampires... I tried to swallow, but the curse of blood turned on me, nyang...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe’s short legs twisted and he flopped down.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was depressed that he couldn’t help Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Randy also an apologetic expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I can’t copy that target.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Didn’t you copy Pagma? Is Elfin Stone stronger than Pagma?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That wasn’t the case.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was the racial limitation and physiology that couldn’t be overcome.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The True Blood vampires were a superior species to doppelgangers, so it was impossible to copy them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Dammit.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The trump cards he believed in had disappeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a desperate situation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone summoned something while Grid was feeling frustrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Iyarugt.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Yakult?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The pronunciation was similar to the 200 won drink that Grid enjoyed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it wasn’t a weapon that could be made fun of.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From the handle to the blade, it was a smooth strip of red.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone’s slightly curved sword was made of blood stone and was so sharp it could cut anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Blood stone!&nbsp;</span><span style="">If adamantium represented the world of the gods, blood stone was a mineral that represented hell.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Adamantium occasionally appeared in the human world because the gods loved humanity, but blood stones were different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There had been little present throughout the history of the human world, so it was an unfamiliar mineral to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It felt a lot different from Pagma’s words. If it wasn’t Pagma, what blacksmith could make this type of sword?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was fascinated by the beautiful appearance and rational structure of Iyarugt, when he suddenly recalled the ‘Third Piece of ???’.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was because the color of the unidentified fragment was similar to the color of Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone’s white robes flapped amidst the bloody magic power as he declared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"There has only been one being who survived Iyarugt. And there will be no one else in the future."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone’s first target was Huroi.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword defended against the blood red sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was possible to predict the behavior.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone’s eyes curved up slightly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was somewhat surprised that a human managed to defend against his sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But that was it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword recovered the sword that confronted Iyarugt, exposing a one second gap when it was put back in the sheath.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ku...heok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The red sword moved through this gap and struck Peak Sword’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is like Iyarugt is...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was obvious that it was an ego sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The ego sword showed its owner the best route.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword was able to tell.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone’s movements weren’t optimized for swordsmanship, making it difficult to predict the sword.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone was wielding the sword at Peak Sword again when a spear aimed at his side.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Pon’s Mach Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But even that wasn’t a big threat to Elfin Stone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Ordinary vampires could only turn all of their body into smoke, but Elfin Stone could change certain parts of his body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His waist turned into black smoke and Pon’s spear missed, then he swung his arm to counter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“How the hell do we kill him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon grabbed his wounded chest and exclaimed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the meantime, the other party members started the offensive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Flaming arrows, unpredictable kicks, swift daggers and powerful storms.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Everything covered Elfin Stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Not even Elfin Stone could neutralize all these attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members standards were too high.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, there was no fatal damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘We will be wiped out if this continues.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At a time when everyone was certain, Grid thought of a way to break from this situation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was only possible because it was Grid.</span></p>
