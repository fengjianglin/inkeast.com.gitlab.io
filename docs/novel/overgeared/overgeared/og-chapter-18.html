 <p><span style="">Chapter 18</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">I melted iron ore and jaffa together, mixing them in the right proportions. Then, I poured the molten iron into the mold. Then, after 40 minutes, I pounded it into the shape of a wire.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">I poured a bucket of water on the wire.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chiiiik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A loud sound was heard as the scorching wire cooled rapidly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Quenching. This process increased the hardness and strength of the metal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Smith seemed disappointed for the first time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You even know about quenching?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes. I have studied various production methods. I am a person who is always prepared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Uhh, I don’t know what you studied, but is this the limit of self-study? Why are you using quenching when making the arrowhead? I’m not sure if you know, but if you quench the metal, it becomes harder and less durable. The moment the arrow strikes the enemy, instead of piercing the enemy, the arrowhead might break in the enemy’s armor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That was right, but I had a special plan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I'll also use tempering.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tempering involved reheating the quenched metal and then gradually lowering it in order to decrease the metal’s brittleness. It was adding a flourish to the production method, which could strengthen the metal in the end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, it would take a lot of time to do all of this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was labor that I didn’t like!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Smith frowned as he felt the same way.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Do you intend to make the arrows all night? I don’t know why you would spend so much time making the arrows. Those who buy arrows consider them as a one-off consumable, so why are you so devoted to making the consumable item?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reason for increasing the amount of labor was simple.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I replied while reheating the quenched wire and hammering at it,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If I make it a bit better, I can sell it for a more expensive price.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Smith understood once he heard my words and no longer interfered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I made the arrowheads by repeatedly quenching, forging, and tempering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">How much time passed by?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was tired and sore, but the heat from the smithy was even more painful. My awkward hammering skills steadily improved over time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your persistence has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your dexterity has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My growing stats really made everything feel worthwhile. I was willing to do anything to raise my stats.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...This.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dammit! It was labor in the game! But it was also fun!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will become addicted to labor one day!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Would a day come when I enjoyed labor in reality as well?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a big deal. I might end up with osteoporosis in my later years of life.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">I complained but still immersed myself in the actions. The wire was slowly converted into an arrowhead as my hammering and my skills became more sophisticated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hoo. Hoo.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I took short breaths. My arms were numb and my skin was hot, but I endured it. My concentration increased as my stamina fell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Patience skill has been activated. Concentration, stamina, and defense will rise to the extremes for one hour.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Suddenly, the weariness in my body disappeared and I felt refreshed. This was similar to the vigor I felt whenever I ate cereal with milk.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ohhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I alternated between the hammer and metals, producing the arrowheads.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The effect of my increased concentration was noticeable in the arrowheads. It might’ve been because I made it myself, but the arrowheads were really beautiful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was happy. Sweating in front of the fire gave me a sense of fulfillment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'This isn’t mere labor. Rather, it is akin to art.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In reality, I had no talent so I felt no pleasure no matter what I did. I had to work my guts off just to fall behind.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now I had talent. It was a talent that could only be shown in Satisfy, but it was enough.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A harmony with the hammer!&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a moment when I felt stability and contentment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath has increased the effectiveness of your production items]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lv. 1</span></p>
 <p><span style="">When you are concentrating on making an item, the will of Pagma’s Descendant will fill the production item.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">All stats of a production item will increase by 5%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There is a rare chance of giving special features to your production items.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">&nbsp;Then 100 arrows were completed!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Special Jaffa Arrow]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Attack Power: 35~42</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An arrow made by a craftsman with great skill and potential but lacking in experience and reputation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Due to the effect of combining jaffa with steel, it has extremely high penetration and ignores some of the enemy’s defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Has a certain chance of ignoring the enemy’s defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 0.1&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[An epic rated item was produced, so all stats have permanently risen by +4 and reputation throughout the continent has risen by +80.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Quest success!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Affinity with Smith has risen to the maximum.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Experience has risen by 300.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was no time to rejoice over the quest’s success and my level up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Epic rated arrow?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weren’t arrows unconditionally a normal rating?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I’ve never heard of an epic rated arrow.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was filled with an indescribable sense of emptiness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Epic rated consumables... An epic rating appeared when I created arrows...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If it was a costly item like a sword or armor, then I would’ve made a big profit. But arrows were cheap and considered consumables, so the profit of an epic rated arrow was limited.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was overcome with bad emotions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Dammit! He should’ve told me to make either sword or armor!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I started to hate Smith, who recommended the Jaffa Arrow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">When I looked at the arrow I made, the short feeling of admiration turned into anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You haven’t gone through an apprenticeship yet you are already making something so great! Ideal arrows! This is the first time that I’ve considered an arrow to be beautiful! You are definitely Pagma’s reincarnation! Ahh! You must be tired of my surprise by now! You are great! Amazing! Wonderful!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I regained my spirit at Smith's words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yes, the first item I made had an epic rating. I didn’t even fail. This fact was enough for me to rejoice and be thankful.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a result of making the epic rated items, all of my stats increased by 4 and my reputation increased.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In addition, the performance of the arrows was amazing. Were there any existing arrows whose attack power exceeded 40?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Plus, there was a special option.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘One arrow is better than a level 20 hand weapon.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Arrows were less profitable than other equipment items due to their nature, but this great performance meant that I would definitely get some money.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I was a little confused because something bigger than I planned emerged.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I had the Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship skill. Due to the effect, the abilities of all my items increased by 10%.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In others words, the basic attack power of a Jaffa Arrow was 20~26, but the ones I created would be 22~28.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From a buyer’s point of view, they would rather buy the Jaffa Arrows from me rather than the general Jaffa Arrows.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But they would be reluctant to pay more.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why? It didn’t make sense to pay more money just for a slight increase in attack power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">So I used quenching, forging, and tempering as a way to maximize the effects of my skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I expected that a fairly good arrow would emerge from a 10% increase in performance plus a more elaborate production process.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then the finished arrows had a better performance than my expectations due to the breath skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I made Jaffa Arrows that had 15 more attack power than existing Jaffa Arrows, and it also had the option of completely ignoring the enemy’s defense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A high-level user would purchase the Jaffa Arrows I made, no matter how expensive they were. It was well worth it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pu~~~~~~ hahahahat!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The superior stats and skills possessed by Pagma’s Descendant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The 40 stat points obtained through the minus levels!&nbsp;</span><span style="">My stats also increased from making epic rated items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Finally, the arrows that could be sold at an expensive price.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I could be certain that today was the best day of my life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It is better than my birthday.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Besides, there was only my little sister who remembered my birthday. It was annoying to hear on my birthday things like ‘Are you sitting alone at home again?’ or ‘Don’t you have any friends?’ This year, I should say those words on my sister’s birthday.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Therefore, it was natural to be one hundred times happier today compared to my embarrassing and lonely birthdays.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Smith watched me laughing like a madman and handed over the 100 completed Jaffa Arrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I originally promised you half of this... but I can’t take such wonderful things. I want you to take all of them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The effect of maximum affinity!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wasn’t this a beautiful favor?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My heart thumped. Smith seemed just like my grandfather so I couldn’t help embracing him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You have shown me great kindness! It was a short meeting but I will never forget you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tears dripped from Smith’s eyes as he hugged me.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Are you leaving already? That’s too bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“We might meet again someday if we’re lucky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I don’t want you to leave...”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Smith glanced at me with a flushed face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Like a male peacock opening its colorful tail feathers to seduce a female, he tried to attract me using hammers, tongs, and the solid muscles of his upper body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This man, he had the smell of a widower so he must’ve been alone for a long time. Maybe he was so lonely that he became gay after his affinity towards me reached the maximum...?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, he might’ve been gay from the beginning.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His dignity decreased in front of his affection. I straightened and let go.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Then I’m going now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I grabbed the 100 epic arrows and hurriedly moved away. However, due to the 100% reduction in movement speed, I couldn’t leave the blacksmith quickly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Smith approached me and hugged me from behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I can see that you also don’t want to separate from me! You are thinking of me in that passionate heart of yours. I’m reluctant to give up this affection. I won’t forget you until the day I lay in my coffin! No, I will think of you, even in my coffin!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This damn person. Stop speaking such terrible words!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Just like with Doran, the excess weight caused a misunderstanding again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I barely got away from Smith made a vow to sell my arrows, find a warehouse, and move to another village as soon as possible.</span></p>
