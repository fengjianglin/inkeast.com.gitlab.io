 <p><span style="">Chapter 344</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He is already tired.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid played a big role on the battlefield, but Lauel wasn’t satisfied. Honestly, it was below expectations.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I wanted him to show that he wasn’t lacking anything.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The ability to read and respond to the enemy’s movements, ability to utilize the terrain, the timing to use skills and take potions, the abilities of the items, etc.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The current Grid wasn’t bad overall, but it wasn’t enough to compare with the high rankers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This wasn’t meant to disparage him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The most appropriate expression was not the best or the worst.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s more exciting to see Yura’s skills. Grid is still lacking. First of all, he has poor control over his stamina and mana.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had to bear that in mind at all times.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The power of legendary skills was excellent, but they consumed a lot of resources.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Every time he is a crisis, he has a habit of relying on Wave and Restraint. It is a fatal weakness against those who can avoid non-targeted skills. I don’t know why he uses Magic Missile so much.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That wasn’t all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The God Hands have a mere artificial intelligence. There are attacks that the God Hands can’t cope with right now... For example, what if they are attacked by a superior attack?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Among the rankers, there were those who were called ‘supreme.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a simple example, Kraugel and Agnus had something in common. A way to strike at them couldn’t be found.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then what about Grid?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were still a lot of gaps.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As far as Lauel could see, Yura would surpass Grid as soon as she reached level 300.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘For sure...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was steadily growing and would continue to do so.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel trusted him, but he still couldn’t help feeling worried.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because every human had a limit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘But.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It didn’t matter if Grid reached the limits of his talent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He can overcome it with items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had the skill to create legendary items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was possible to create completely new types of items, making the possibilities endless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will help you make more creative items than typical items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel thought while looking at the battlefield and commanding the soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unlike his attitude, his vision captured the movements of Prince Ren.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“He’s finally leaving the battlefield.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The knights blocked Grid, while the northern troops and Reidan troops were busy dealing with the soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No one noticed that the enemy, Prince Ren, was running away.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This will make him easier to capture.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel opened the list of Reidan’s soldiers and arranged them in order of level.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he named 13 soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Arm yourselves with this and follow me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soldiers that Lauel pointed out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had all reached the level 160 required for the Mass Production Grid Set.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s impossible! This is ridiculous!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Prince Ren had an excruciating headache.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moon shining down on the cold desert didn’t cool the boiling heat in his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Using power to overcome the difference in numbers and detecting all my strategies!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was far beyond what Prince Ren assumed. A person that shouldn’t be turned into an enemy. Despite the loss of his royal dignity, he had to admit this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Patrian horses running through the desert sand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Prince Ren held the reins tightly as pain, anger, regret, and despair dominated his mind.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The defeat today might’ve completely destroyed the foundation of the 1st Prince. He was feeling frustrating when a group appeared behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel and the 13 soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Prince Ren! If you don’t want to die, surrender right now! Stop if you want to live!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Would you stop if you were me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Prince Ren thought scoffed at Lauel’s nonsensical words and spurred the horse on.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel sighed and beckoned to the soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shoot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Shoot a bow while riding on a horse?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Reidan soldiers were baffled. They were novices in riding horses, so shooting on horseback was a long time away.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel shouted as they hesitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Trust in the power of items!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Items...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Common NPCs didn’t know the concept of being overgeared, but the soldiers of Reidan were different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their superiors had sat them down and told them about being overgeared and the power of items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They pulled out their bows while their horses ran.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel was the same.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then a notification window popped up in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have let go of the horse’s reins! Danger! The risk of falling from the horse will increase by 60%!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Mass Produced Grid’s Gaiters have attached to the stirrups. The risk of falling has decreased significantly.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He made it properly!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The skills of elite soldiers included horseback riding.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it took a considerable amount of time to train them to wield a sword or shoot arrows on a running horse.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, the desert terrain of Reidan made it harder for beginners to learn.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel was worried about this and made a request to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Solve it with items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s response to this was the Mass Produced Grid’s Gaiters.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was made in a form where the gaiters could be attached to the stirrups.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was the disadvantage of being uncomfortable when getting off the horse, but...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘We will get used to it!’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kirik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">On a running horse!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel and 13 soldiers pulled back their bowstrings!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Prince Ren was shocked by the sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Soldiers have learned the skill of fighting on horseback?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was difficult for even knights to learn!&nbsp;</span><span style="">A smile appeared on Lauel’s face as he saw Prince Ren’s expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Reidan’s soldiers, you are the loyal subordinates of Duke Grid! Place your anger in the sharp arrowheads! Pass on the arrows of regret and despair towards the head of the enemy who dared invade Reidan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 13 soldiers got goosebumps at Lauel’s horrific shout.&nbsp;</span>But they were the soldiers who endured Piaro and Asmophel’s hell training, so they calmed their minds and fired the bow in an unwavering manner.</p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pa pa pa pat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Protect the prince!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As the heir, Prince Ren’s importance was very high in the Eternal Kingdom. He was constantly guarded by members of the Silver Dragons.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Daluka’s Clothes were turned off, and the five Silver Dragons following the prince revealed themselves, breaking the 14 arrows with their daggers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The silver color in the darkness was very sharp.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘They are strong!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Panic appeared on the soldiers’ faces. Their skills weren’t at the level to deal with high level assassins.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Lauel was still smiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Noe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the best demonic beast in hell.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Throughout this war, he had been asleep on Lauel’s chest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had ordered that he escort Lauel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A black cat with small demon wings!&nbsp;</span><span style="">His chubby body flew to the assassins and swung his sharp claws.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Nya nya nya nya nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Heok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Keok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Silver Dragons were strong.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t easy for Noe, who was only in the early 200’s, to easily overpower them. The daggers focused on blocking Noe’s attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Noe had a secret technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kyong!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe’s mouth stretched wide open.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The agility of the Silver Dragons was swallowed by Noe.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I’m much better compared to my previous life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Qi was focused on Lauel’s fingertips.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the Dragon’s Claws sprang up from the ground and fatally injured the weakened Silver Dragons.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"U-Unbelievable!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Silver Dragons were easily subdued!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is that crazy cat?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Prince Ren increased the speed of his horse. But Noe’s movement speed far exceeded it after taking the agility of the Silver Dragons.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The cat’s paws struck the back of Prince Ren’s head and knocked him down.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the shame of a lifetime.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The Reidan army’s military barracks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The 1st Prince Ren, who abandoned his army and retreated, and the soldiers who were captured.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You guys dare!? Don’t you know who I am?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Royalty. Ren, who was first in the line of succession, recognized himself as a holy presence.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wasn’t it too insulting to be caught by soldiers and dragged around like a dog?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would rather die than bear this shame.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid read the anger and resentment filling those stubborn eyes and scoffed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This totally crazy bastard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He might be a prisoner, but wasn’t he still a prince of the Eternal Kingdom?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He should be treated with a minimum of courtesy, not dragged around and forced to kneel like a dog!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“E-Ek? Duke Grid! You! How can you say such words?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s easy. Aren’t you really crazy? First, you’re the one who invaded my territory, but you want to blame me? What is with this impertinent attitude?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Don’t talk nonsense!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaduduk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Prince Ren coughed up blood. It felt like something was broken.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid sighed,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“You don’t know your mistake.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the temperament of the strong.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were accustomed to trampling on others and living their own way. They were unaware of their own faults.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It was the same with Lee Junho and Choi Chansung.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had been bullied by them for a long time, so he was well aware of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“People like you don’t change easily. It’s the same for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s current personality was mostly shaped by what he experienced.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had been submissive and trampled on for most of his life, giving him an obsession to pay back any grudges and a tendency for violence. His basic tendencies still hadn’t changed, even with his life improving.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Lower your eyes.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t treat the other person in a special manner just because he was a prince.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He forced Prince Ren to bow his head and made an immediate decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You are sentenced to death."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a commotion in the surroundings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was a captivity law in the West Continent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a common law that lasted for hundreds of years that prisoners couldn’t be harmed if they were nobility or royalty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The fact that Grid would violate this law astonished Prince Ren and the royal army.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel sent Grid a whisper.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Hold on.</span></i> <i><span style="">If you kill Prince Ren, Reidan will become independent and have a completely hostile relationship with the Eternal Kingdom.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Then let’s be independent.</span></i> <i><span style="">Won’t I be king anyway?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It’s premature.</span></i> <i><span style="">If Reidan becomes independent from Eternal right now, there’s a possibility that Marquis Steim’s northern territory will be taken while it is isolated, and Reidan is likely to become the empire’s prey.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Hmm.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s understanding was low. But he paid attention to what the other person said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I don’t know...</span></i> <i><span style="">Then what should I do?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Be magnanimous and spare him.</span></i> <i><span style="">Anyway, Prince Ren is responsible for this war and he has completely lost his foundation.</span></i> <i><span style="">By sending him back alive, you can make him build up forces loyal to you, killing two birds with one stone.</span></i> <i><span style="">More forces will support you and Reidan can establish a greater presence in the Eternal Kingdom.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-But I already declared that I wouldn’t send the invaders back alive.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I’m telling you to reverse the decision.</span></i> <i><span style="">You won’t lose any dignity.</span></i> <i><span style="">No, many users will admire your wise choice.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">That...</span></i> <i><span style="">Really?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Reversing the decision.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid didn’t particularly like it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">You, you aren’t planning to stab me in the back later right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It will never happen, as long as you are ruling above me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-...</span><i><span style="">I will work hard, even if you’re scary.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Huhuhut!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The smiling chuunibyou Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The fact that he would never commit betrayal, Grid knew this better than anyone else.</span></p>
