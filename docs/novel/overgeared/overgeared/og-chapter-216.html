 <p><span style="">Chapter 216</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Nine days ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members utilized the excellent transportation method of carriages and arrived in Reidan ahead of Grid, but they tasted huge disappointment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The best city in the west, Reidan!&nbsp;</span><span style="">According to the map, it was the second largest city of the Eternal Kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members were full of expectations, but they were baffled because it looked more like a ruin.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What happened here?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow, there is nothing big in the city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The shops are closed, the doors broken and the poor are on the street...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The rice fields are like a wasteland.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"In the first place, doesn’t the population seem too small?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi, Lauel, and Faker remained calm while the guild members were making a disturbance. They looked over Reidan because bringing up its information.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Name: Reidan</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Size: Big City</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ruler: Grid (Duke of the Eternal Kingdom. Master of the Overgeared Guild)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Administrator: Arik (C-grade administrative ability)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The higher the administrative ability of the administrator, the higher the overall development of the estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Affiliation: The Eternal Kingdom</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Population: NPCs - 20,551. Players - 0.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Troops: Knights - 2 (Huroi, Lauel).</span></p>
 <p><span style="">&nbsp; &nbsp; Soldiers - 141</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Security: 5/100</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The state of security is the worst. It isn’t unusual if the people turn into a mob straight away. Gangsters and monsters will often pop up near the village.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Security will increase hourly in proportion to the number of soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* People jobs and food for a policing activity is not available, even if the police do not rise.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Internal Affairs: 169/4,500</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Increasing the number of shopping malls, public cultural facilities and buildings will increase the internal affairs number.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Foreign Affairs: The Butin Barony in the Saharan Empire.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Forces hostile to the ruler: Yatan Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Forces hostile to your affiliated groups: Gauss Kingdom, Luvia Principality.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Specialties: None.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Distinguished Figure: None.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The situation isn't as good as I expected."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It seems like it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">While moving from Winston to Reidan, the guild members were attracted to the monsters of the west and devoted themselves to hunting. They waited for monsters to attack the moving carriage, then quickly hunted them for experience. Therefore, they thought the west was a blessed land.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Huroi, Lauel, and Faker thought that the strong monsters in the west were a negative point.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The monsters were so strong that the accessibility of general users was low, and the area would be difficult to manage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now the reality they faced was worse than their expectations.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A city that can accommodate over 500,000 people only has a population of 20,000...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Furthermore, there are no users.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The biggest priority right now is to pay the people raise the security level.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared Guild currently had 5 million gold in funds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">5 million gold.&nbsp;</span><span style="">While that amount of gold might sound large for a single person, it wasn’t enough to fund a big city.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Not only that, 5 million gold didn’t even seem like enough to develop an empty, desolate city.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now they had to pay expenses to raise the goodwill of the people?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was it even possible to produce food in this city in the first place? It wasn’t possible to even make barley bread. It was inevitable that they would have to import ingredients, but merchants were aware of the situation and wouldn’t come to Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Considering the transportation cost...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel calculated that he had to set a minimum of 3 silver for one meal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If it was 20,000 people, he would have to pay 600 gold. This was one meal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was ridiculous to spend hundreds of thousands of gold on meals until a fundamental solution was set up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Lauel couldn’t alienate the people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Did he feel compassion when seeing their skinny selves?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That was irrelevant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">People were the national power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He needed to restore them first, then there would be a rise in security and labor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was no other choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"After making the people useful, set them to clearing the fields.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"But doesn’t the lord have to give permission?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi was cautious.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He knew that restoring the people was the most pressing issue, but he wondered if Grid would understand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid would wonder why they were wasting money on people’s meals.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi spoke to the worried Lauel,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“South Korean doesn’t give up on making hot pepper paste just because of worms. &nbsp;That is a saying in South Korea.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the right choice, even if it was against Grid’s will.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was Chief Lauel’s conviction to grow the Overgeared Guild. Hoewever, the saying was too provocative.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi thought about the saying that Lauel mentioned and became indignant,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Don’t compare My Lord to measly worms!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ah no, that's not what I meant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel sweated profusely as he tried to soothe Huroi.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, Faker disappeared from next to the two men, moving through the yellow dust before arriving at the castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why didn’t you move quickly after hearing that the new lord’s men had arrived? Your greeting is late!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“T-That... I was afraid that I would be stoned by the people if I left the castle and that made me late.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Pathetic guy. You are armed with sword and armor, but are afraid of rocks? What a worthless person. Tsk tsk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A fat, middle-aged man hurried to the entrance of the castle with his soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This greasy man’s name was Arik, the administrator of Reidan. He was a baronet and often received treatment as a noble.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker pointed his dagger at Arik without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hiik!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Arik exclaimed as he saw the shadows in the yellow dust.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"W-Who are you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker replied in a cold voice,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“A person with a lot of questions for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What...? Kiyaaack~!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was in an instant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Faker and Arik disappeared into the yellow dust like they weren’t there in the first place.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Administrator Arik?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The stunned soldiers looked around, but they couldn’t find any traces of Arik.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">'This is a normal level?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bland had watched Grid training under Piaro for the past three days.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bland originally saw Grid as very strong. Grid would become much stronger under Piaro’s teachings and would have no education.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, Piaro evaluated Grid as ordinary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was satisfied that he wasn’t worse compared to others.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bland couldn’t believe it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘Why are his skills so bad and dull? Doesn’t he have great skills?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the difference in perspective.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From Bland’s point of view, Earl Steim and Phoenix were the strongest swordsmen until he met Piaro, but Grid seemed to have a lot of talent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, Grid compared his abilities to the top rankers and boss monsters, and decided this was good.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then what about Piaro?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He evaluated Grid’s ability as ‘poor in comparison to his amount of power.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The conclusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Puhahat! Now I can easily hunt monsters in the west without having to rely on skills!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is just the basics. Only the lousy people rely solely on skills. You still have a long way to go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Wouldn’t it be better to keep practicing steadily? Continue teaching me in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I refuse. It is unlikely that your skills will improve, even if I keep teaching you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don't give up so easily. It isn’t that hard, is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This is a realistic analysis, not one based on any emotions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was strong.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was true that he was lacking control skills compared to top rankers, but from a normal point of view, he was beyond the average level.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the monsters in the west were so strong that his limits started to show.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hap!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now Grid had perfectly adapted to the strange terrain of the desert.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He ran on the sand with light footsteps and freely wielded Failure, causing the monsters of the west to collapse.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a result, Grid reached level 275 and finally arrived in Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This is your city?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The scale of Reidan that came into view was huge.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The exterior walls weren’t very high or well-maintained, but they spectacularly stretched out along the horizon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is a huge city comparable to the capital of a kingdom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid smiled at Piaro’s admiring words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It is the second biggest city in the Eternal Kingdom after Reinhardt.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was filled with anticipation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He imagined hundreds of thousands of people in Reidan greeting him with confetti.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid prompted Bland and Piaro and increased the pace.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he was confused as he found people working on clearing the land.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Are they refugees?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The people were skinny, dressed in poor clothes and looked like refugees.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid wondered why they were doing field work in Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘They seem to be slaves.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He wondered if the people of Reidan hired slaved to work on the farmland.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid tsked at the thought.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘They might be slaves but they should be properly fed. What unscrupulous employers.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The people of Reidan didn’t seem to have a good mentality.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, their mentality had nothing to do with Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘They are just my taxes.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Lululula.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid looked at the nearest entrance to the city and hummed with a happy heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He imagined a fanfare and hundreds of thousands of people welcoming him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid witnessed a bizarre sight and stopped walking.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members were working among the tens of thousands of slaves?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘W-What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid saw the Overgeared members sweating hard as they worked and stopped humming.&nbsp;</span><span style="">An ominous thought struck him before Regas saw him and ran over with a bright smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You finally came!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas’ solid upper body was stained with sweat and dust. He looked like a worker in a coal mine so Grid asked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What are you doing right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"As you can see, we are clearing the fields with the people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"... With the people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Where were the people?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid only saw the Overgeared members and the slaves.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I greet My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi came running.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was also sweaty.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid saw the rake in his hand and asked again,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“What are you doing right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi had the same answer as Regas,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"We are clearing the fields with the people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No, that isn’t it. The people...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel rushed over at that time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Why were you so late?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel berated with a scruffy appearance as well. He also held farming equipment in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You didn’t respond to my whispers, so I had to start the guild members on the urgent tasks. First of all, we are joining forces with the people to connect the waterways and plant the fields, so we will be able to produce simple food in a few months.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid finally perceived reality. Then he desperately asked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Where are the people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Can’t you see them?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel turned his gaze to the fields.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel’s finger was pointing to the people on the fields, the thin ones who Grid thought were slaves.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"They are your people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“... Ah, why me?” </span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the moment when Grid’s expectations collapsed.</span></p>
