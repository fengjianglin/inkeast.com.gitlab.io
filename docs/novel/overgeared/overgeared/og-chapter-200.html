 <p><i><span style="">Kuaaaaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a flash of light from the ancient weapon and a powerful explosion occurred. Everything within a radius of 15m was destroyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oppa!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee became pale as she witnessed Grid being swept up in the explosion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s health in the party window was at the very minimum.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“My Lord!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi and Lauel had only seen Grid’s invincible appearance. Grid dying in battle? They never even imagined it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The two people filled with severe confusion and the panicked Euphemina ran towards Grid. On the other hand, Grid was relieved and surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ouch... Why did an explosion occur all of a sudden? I have a headache.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid questioned it. He grumbled as he rose from his spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Exactly one.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He only had one point of health left.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to this one point, he didn’t die. It truly was like a miracle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The excited Huroi shouted,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"The heavens helped you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel was relieved.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"It is hard to believe that you survived that explosion. What type of defense do you have?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It isn’t higher than most people. It is the power of items?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid spoke with a smile, but he was inwardly uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I lost my insurance.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reason why Grid could be confident in battle every time was because he believed in his invincible passive. Compared to ordinary users, he had two lives.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now that he lost his invincible passive, he was forced to cower.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The cooldown of the invincible passive is one day...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid decided that he should be cautious. Then he asked Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“The first one didn’t explode. Then why did the second ancient weapon explode? What is the rule?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It is hard to guess accurately with only two examples. The best we can do now is fight with the assumption that the 10 remaining ancient weapons will explode after death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That means we need to leave immediately after killing...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was looking troubled when the golems started to gather from all directions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the worst situation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The golems scattered throughout Reinhardt all started targeting Grid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were 800 of them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s group had destroyed a lot, but there were still many of them left. It was a life or death crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It seems that you drew the aggro after successively killing the ancient weapons. Euphemina, have you duplicated Heal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Unfortunately, I haven’t. The Rebecca priests are so precious that I didn’t have many opportunities to duplicate Heal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Retreat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid needed time to recover. Huroi and Lauel tried to get him to escape, but the soul dolls’ speed was too fast.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kyaak!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjeejeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi barely prevented the onslaught from the soul dolls and sat down after being stabbed. It was difficult for him to deal with the soul dolls with his skills. He barely managed to survive thanks to the protection of his drake.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel was also vulnerable when it came to close combat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina tried to support the two, but it was no use because of the Anti-magic Shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the end, Grid had only one way out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the past, he would’ve saved his life by running away alone. However, now he had no thoughts of throwing away his companions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Support me from the rear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had been sitting in order to speed up his recovery, but now he stood up. Then he stepped out in front of the part and took the finest potion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[7,500 health has been be restored.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Che.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If he combined all his items and titles, Grid’s health was close to 60,000. The recovery amount of 7,500 wasn’t great.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid became aware of the danger of allowing attacks and his movements became very passive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t help sweating as 100 soul dolls and 700 old golems came at him. He defended with the pavranium while waiting for the cooldown time of the potion to run out.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The 10 ancient weapons in different locations fired their rays of magic power, further pushing Grid on the defensive.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Protect Viscount Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The northern troops from Winston tried to help Grid’s party. But it didn’t help much. The casualties kept increasing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid felt regret.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I should’ve worn Doran’s Ring in advance.'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had become better at using Doran’s Ring in battle. He wore Doran’s Ring the moment the enemy used a powerful skill in order to maximize the recovery effect.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he didn’t wear Doran’s Ring in battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was too overconfident.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a result, he couldn’t cope with the sudden explosion of the ancient weapon and couldn’t use Doran’s Ring to restore his health. So now he was in a crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oppa...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was dealing with the golems with a low amount of health.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was visibly struggling to Sehee.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I want to help.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee didn’t want to see her brother being harassed. She also didn’t want to ignore the soldiers dying for her brother.&nbsp;</span><span style="">More power was needed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will become a Saintess.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Immediately after the announcement that she could become a Saintess, a golden exclamation mark appeared on one side.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unlike her brother, Sehee immediately realized what this exclamation mark was.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If I click on this, I can go through the process of becoming a Saintess?’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttalkak.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee touched the exclamation mark.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the warm voice of a woman started to flow into her brain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Saintess must be a role model for everyone. If you become the Saintess, you are obliged to do 50 or more good works every month. If you violate this rule, you will be deprived of your status and won’t be able to become a Saintess again.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[It isn’t possible for a Saintess to acquire any skills other than class specific skills.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A Saintess can only use class specific weapons.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Do you still want to become a Saintess after knowing these facts?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Swaahh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">After answering, Sehee’s body started to shine with a warm golden light.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The notification windows flashed before her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have become the growth type hidden class, a Saintess.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A Saintess class starts at the epic rating. You must meet certain conditions in order to raise the rating.]</span></p>

 <p><span style="">[Congratulations! You are a unique existence in Satisfy. Your great power to heal others without borrowing from divine power is backed by a strong sense of responsibility.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee wasn’t a fool. She equipped the Wooden Staff and quickly discovered what skills could help her brother.</span></p>

 <p><span style="">She needed to use the Hope skill to help her brother. She was lacking mana at level 1, so Hope and Sacrifice were the only skills she could use.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sehee was determined to reach Grid, but Jude restrained her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ruby. Sexy Schoolgirl. You shouldn’t go to that dangerous place. You must be safe. It is Viscount Grid’s command.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee saw that Jude was a simple person and easily convinced him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Do you think that our lives are more important than the life of Viscount Grid? We aren’t the ones in danger right now, it’s Grid. If we don’t help him, he might lose his life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"... Viscount Grid is more important.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jude grabbed the black greatsword with both hands. Then he ran 150m to the place where Grid was located, mercilessly breaking through the old golems and soul dolls.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kiyaaaaak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">After Grid’s nurturing, Jude’s strength was now at 2,080.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohhhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Among the top rankers, it was extremely rare to have a strength exceeding 2,000. In addition, the power of the +8 Dainsleif that Jude wielded with all his power was comparable to Grid’s offensive power, making it difficult for the old golems and soul dolls to endure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the end, Sehee was able to approach Grid safely thanks to Jude.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sehee?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t hurt Oppa!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee used the Hope skill and a warm light surrounded Grid’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[20% of your total health has been restored.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The option effect of the Holy Light Armor has increased the power of recovery magic by 300%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[35,580 health has been restored.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the moment when the strongest healer and the best armor evoked a massive synergy effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"... Percentage heal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was astonished.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His sister was a beginner, but then she suddenly became a Saintess and could use a healing skill?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee shouted while he was confused,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Oppa, aren’t you the best? Go and smash these bad guys!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The best?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was the pathetic person who did nothing for 28 years and worried his family.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was thrilled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Thank you, Satisfy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He became the legendary Pagma's Descendant in Satisfy and was able to change his life.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The worst person turned into the best.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Without Satisfy, I would still be living a trivial life...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At this moment, Grid was able to completely remove his shame at his pathetic past self and he felt his blood boiling. Aura sprang up around him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He felt stronger than when he received Huroi’s Morale Boost buff.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to Sehee’s heal, he recovered 40,000 health. Therefore, he started his sword dance with confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship! Wave!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Roaaaaar!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Hundreds of blue-white waves of energy spread all over the place.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The golems directly attacked by him suffered great damage and suffered a slow debuff at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there were many more golems unaffected.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kiyaaak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The attacks of the soul dolls randomly struck Grid’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid didn’t shrink back.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He kept attacking as he was being hit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had the strong healer called Sehee behind him, so he was able to use his combat style that required no control to destroy the soul dolls.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 3,300 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 20,900 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 2,930 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 44,200 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 3,080 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Failure’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘5 Joint Attacks’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 101,500 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have destroyed a soul doll.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[15% of your total health has been restored.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The option effect of the Holy Light Armor has increased the power of recovery magic by 300%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[26,685 health has been restored.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sehee! You're really the best! The best! Puhat! Puhahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This synergy between brother and sister was truly good.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid couldn’t stop laughing. His momentum increased as he fought.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now Sehee was level 13. She got a lot of experience in return for using healing on the level 270 Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi, Lauel and Euphemina were speechless at the sight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A class that could only use heals from level 1? Yet the amount of healing was so enormous? Didn’t this rival the heals of high level priests?&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, Euphemina received a great shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have failed to observe the target’s skill.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have failed to observe the target’s skill.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have failed to observe the target’s skill.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It has been a very long time since she failed to observe Grid and Agnus’ skills.</span></p>
