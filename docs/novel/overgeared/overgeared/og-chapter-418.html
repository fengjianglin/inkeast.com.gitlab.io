 <p><span style="">[Spiral Quick Fire Bow]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Attack Power: 215~249 &nbsp;&nbsp;Firing Speed: +17%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Accuracy: -30%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Every time you shot an arrow, the firing speed will increase by 0.5%. This effect will only be applied up to 50%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* It is difficult to control the trajectory of the arrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* If you hit the ‘desired target,’ you will gain additional Bow Mastery experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A bow made by the legendary blacksmith Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The structure of the bow and arrow is unusual. It is difficult to predict the trajectory of an arrow the user even hit rate is very poor.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kkirik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid took out the bow that he made after much suffering.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then a notification window appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The effect of Beginner Weapons Mastery Lv. 8 is higher than the effect of Beginner Bow Mastery Lv. 3.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The passive Weapons Mastery skill is applied.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid learned Bow Mastery much faster than Weapons Mastery.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the level of Weapons Mastery was much higher than Bow Mastery because Grid’s main weapon was a sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Weapons Mastery accumulated experience with any type of weapon, while Bow Mastery only gained experience when using a bow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘When I use the bow, both Weapons Mastery and Bow Mastery increases. If the level of the two masteries is similar someday, I will start to see the advantage of Bow Mastery.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Paang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Unless they were some combat specialized class, more ordinary users only learned one type of mastery.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Blacksmiths didn’t have any mastery skill at all.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was a blacksmith, yet he possessed Weapons Mastery, Bow Mastery, and Magic Mastery.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had endless potential.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 H-He is really shooting a bow! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One arrow left Grid’s bowstring.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The spectators looked on as it moved in a zigzag, the movements hard to predict.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the moment that the dignity of the legendary Pagma’s Descendant class was howed to the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was confident.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I’m no longer someone you can ignore.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had lived a life where he wasn’t acknowledged by people. He had always been despised for his lack of talent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now it was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, it was a game where Grid broke the prejudices of the people who knew him and became the best.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Grid has accurately hit the target!!! 』 </span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Firing speed has increased by 1%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The arrow has hit the desired target. Additional Bow Mastery experienced has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kkirik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid pulled the bowstring again with calm eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As the stagnant score of South Korea started moving again...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your arrow has missed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your arrow has missed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your arrow...]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...This is rotten.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Indeed, his luck was bad.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It happened when Grid saw that the arrows were flying in a different direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The situation is turned upside down! The United States has surpassed South Korea’s score! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Russia and Canada are also close to South Korea’s score! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The other countries are finally fully engaged in the target processing, but South Korea has only three survivors. They will keep falling behind. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Hah... Regas and Seuron are still fighting. I want to express my sympathies to the people of Britain and Argentina. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 To the people of China and Japan... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is there nothing I can do?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s heart weakened for the first time in a while.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had been trying so hard for the past year, so he felt frustrated because he couldn’t achieve his desired result.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘...No, it isn’t over yet.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid bit his lip and firmed up his heart. The bowstring was pulled close to his red lips.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was extremely focused when there was a new change on the battlefield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The scores of the US and Russia stopped.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">{Shit! East cliff! Check it! }</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{U-Uhh? What? Why isn’t magic working?}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{There’s a reason. Haven’t you heard the rumor that it is impossible to hit him with non-targeted skills?}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{I thought it was an exaggerated rumor.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{An exaggeration? There is never any exaggeration when describing him. Rather, it’s too lacking.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Economies, industrial, science, culture, arts, military, academics, sports, etc.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The United States had always been the leader in every field. There was nothing comparable to the largest and strongest country in the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was natural that the United States would hold the title of the strongest in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the strongest United States was currently in turmoil.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was due to only one person.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The sky above the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Kraugel...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel’s face distorted as he clung to the top of the mountain and looked at the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s my mistake.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It happened the moment he was convinced that Kraugel would target South Korea’s Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘We should’ve adjusted the pace of our scoring until Kraugel had a direct conflict with South Korea.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But that didn’t happen.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The United States overtook South Korea’s score before Yura was attacked, causing Kraugel to switch targets.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kraugel was only aiming for gold.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From his point of view, it was natural for him to target the most threatening country.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh... My health...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were some rules in the 2nd National Competition’s PvP field.&nbsp;</span><span style="">First, damage was reduced by 50%.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Second, various recovery potions and buff potions couldn’t be taken.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Third, pets couldn’t be summoned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">These were measures to ensure that the participants fought purely with their combat abilities, and to allow the viewers to watch entertaining scenes for a longer time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was why Zibal still wasn’t fully functional after receiving a large injury from Pon’s Rail Spear. Only two-thirds of his health had recovered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How could they deal with the monster called Kraugel in this state?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a very regrettable thing for Zibal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he couldn’t stay still.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel restrained him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You should try to recover a bit more. If you rush it, you will just be hurt worse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Healers were rare and precious in this game.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He realized it again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, the value of Pope Damian and the Rebecca Church, which could train healers, was more important. He needed to be turned into a perfect ally.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In this dire situation, Lauel was still thinking about Overgeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Russia is approaching through the western path. All personnel, except for Skull, should prepare to face the enemy. I will stop Kraugel in the east with Skull.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The United State’s power was certainly unique. They completely overwhelmed Spain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It should be relatively easy to deal with Russia if Kraugel’s feet were tied up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel believed so and used Dragon’s Stretch to cause a landslide.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel confirmed that most of the US rankers moved away, used White Light Steps to avoid the 8th ranked Skull and came face to face with Lauel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Indeed. He always targets the head.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Smart people were always a target.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel predicted that Kraugel would aim for him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the reason why he made Zibal keep recovering here.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Zibal! Let’s see if your hands can reach the sky!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m ranked 2nd! I’m the only person qualified to crack the sky!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal received Lauel’s provocation and jumped up to face Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had shown excellent skills in hunting and boss raids, but nothing in PvP.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t participate in the 1st National Competition’s PvP event, so he had to prove himself now.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reason he neglected PvP was because he wasn’t interested, not because he was weak!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kraugelllllll!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal screamed and pulled out a grey rod.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the emergence of the ego weapon made by the 1st ranked blacksmith, Panmir, who used the techniques learned from the dwarf city Talima.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The grey rod was 1m in length and soared into the sky. The length quickly grew to 3m in an instant and aimed for Kraugel’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Suuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment that Kraugel avoided it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pakak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The end of the grey rod turned at a right angle and hit Kraugel’s temple. Kraugel couldn’t overcome the shock and fell down.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuuuuong.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"...This is items.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel never imagined that Zibal could do this much.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, the world was in great disorder.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 T-The sky above the sky...! The sky above the sky!!! 』&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 He fell!!! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 It’s because of Zibal! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were skeptical of his abilities since he was assassinated by Tarma who was logged out by Grid in 3 seconds, but he truly was the 2nd rank.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The rumor that he had a close fight with the crazy farmer of Reidan wasn’t a lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Waaahhhhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Zibal! Zibal! Zibal!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Americans cheered and stomped their feet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A stir filled the Stade de France National Stadium.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I am Zibal! I am the most powerful American!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal shouted excitedly. Kraugel responded by slowly raising his body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His condition wasn’t good.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was it due to the injury from Zibal?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No. Kraugel’s defense wasn’t so poor that Zibal’s blow would cause a big injury.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel was just tired.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It had been 30 minutes since the target processing started and he had wiped out more than 10 countries alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His stamina was low and as a result, his concentration dropped, and his movements became less stable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It’s very unfortunate that it isn’t Grid, but this is a chance to break down the sky in front of the whole world...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel finished casting Dragon Stretch and reached out towards Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The 8th ranked Skull had climbed the cliff and was aiming for Kraugel’s back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Just rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel proposed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kurururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Dragon Stretch crumbled the floor around Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Open Arms!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skull continuous hit Kruagel’s back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will wash away the stain on my reputation today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal controlled the grey rod and aimed it at Kraugel’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel faced strong skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was sweating so much it was like raindrops, but he remembered his sick mother.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A deep desire filled his black eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He struggled and endured because he only wished for his mother’s recovery.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Super Sensitivity.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kakiing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The strongest skill that only a person who obtained the title of great swordsman could use was activated and the owner moved between Zibal, Lauel, and Skull.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">America’s strongest players were shattered by the combination of a speed that couldn’t be followed with the eyes, an attack that seemed beyond cognitive ability, and the hard to match destructive power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At this moment, Kraugel was invincible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was a truth that nobody in the world could argue against.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The sky that Grid wanted to reach was endlessly high.</span></p>
