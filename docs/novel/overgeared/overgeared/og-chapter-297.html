 <p><span style="">Chapter 287</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“What will happen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Three men were sitting side by side in a spacious living room that was like a playground.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What was the identity of those enjoying the cool soju and spicy chicken feet while wearing 3D glasses?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were Chairman Lim Cheolho, Director Yoon Sangmin, and Team Leader Ashley Tosun.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were major figures in the company.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reason why these busy people gathered in Lim Cheolho’s mansion wasn’t for a simple drinking party.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the big screen, Grid’s party would soon encounter Elfin Stone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Could they really succeed in the Elfin Stone raid?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The three people wanted to check it out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was a debate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“In order to raid Elfin Stone, at least three third advancement healers are needed in the party.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The top priority was to neutralize Elfin Stone’s Blood Field.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Elfin Stone took only 1.8 seconds to deploy Blood Field.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was difficult to block it from being activated, so it needed to be offset with continuous healing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A eight person party with no healers wouldn’t be able to raid Elfin Stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The father of vampires, Team Leader Ashley, was confident.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I don’t know what would’ve happened if Huroi was alive, but the possibility of Grid’s current party successfully raiding Elfin Stone is zero.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi was able to maximize the attack power of the party members while maintaining aggro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Ashley thought that Grid was stupid for sacrificing someone so important to the party.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Lim Cheolho gave a different opinion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the first place, Grid’s party would’ve been wiped out if they hadn’t sacrificed Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"In addition, the strength of Pagma's Descendant is far above what was originally planned. One of the five people who can cause miracles in Satisfy is Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid wasn’t the only special one in the party.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka, Peak Sword, Pon, Regas, Faker, Vantner and Zednos.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had excellent control and senses, demonstrating a strength that was beyond the concept of levels and classes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Wouldn’t they have the power to beat Elfin Stone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yoon Sangmin ate a chicken feet and speculated carefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I agree with both of you. But to be honest, I don’t think Grid’s party can succeed in this raid. The influence of Blood Field is too strong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the past, Yoon Sangmin cursed Grid for being stupid and frustrating.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was resentful that someone so stupid took one of the nine legendary classes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now he was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He watched the changes and growth of Grid that took place over a year, and now supported Grid. His wife didn’t know it, but he was a great member of Grid’s fan club.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, even Yoon Sangmin was skeptical about this raid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lim Cheolho’s lips, which were swollen due to eating spicy chicken feet, curved in a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Then my odds will rise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The leaders of the world’s largest corporation gathered to bet on Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They seemed to have a lot of free time, but this wasn’t the case. They weren’t wasting time watching Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was a special existence.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They didn’t want to miss the biography of a person who grew up through Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The former 5th ranked Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was the world’s best female ranker who suddenly lost her ranking four months ago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What was the reason?&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was still a big issue and caused curiosity among countless people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel and the Overgeared members were exposed to the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Demon Slayer...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura joined Overgeared with the authority of the lord’s agent, Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The guild members weren’t familiar with her class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As many people guessed, she obtained a hidden class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was also a legendary hidden class!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel and the Overgeared members were thrilled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Demon Slayer class was written in gold, just like Pagma’s Descendant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there was something odd.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘According to Grid, legendary classes get their level reset to level 1?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, Yura was currently level 203.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It meant she went from level 1 to level 203 in just four months.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A typical user. No, it was three times faster than the growth rate of the strongest rankers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s amazing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She was someone who maintained the 5th ranking as a black magician that was hard to raise.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Acquiring a legendary class was like growing wings on her back.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She used her innate talents, effort and the know-how she accumulated as the 5th ranked user to raise her level at a speed that exceeded common sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel and the Overgeared members were amazed, while Yura watched Reidan Castle’s resurrection point.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I was told Youngwoo-ssi would appear soon.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She heard about what happened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The group of eight encountered a boss that was impossible to raid and would be wiped out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I don’t think so.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura was always watching Grid. She looked at all the stories related to him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Taking into account Grid’s growth and the features of a legendary class...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Youngwoo-ssi can produce results that others can’t imagine.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura knew about Grid’s past.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had gone through all types of hardships due to a lack of natural talents and bad fortune.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had lived an unhappy life for 26 out of his 27 years and suffered countless wounds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura wanted him to no longer feel despair. She simply wanted him to be happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will share my good luck. So please come back safely with a bright expression.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura’s true heart was shown when Grid was in trouble.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone slept for 23 hours and his condition was the best.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The day before, he tortured the human who dared insult Shizo Beriache and was able to get a good rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Today I should work harder than usual.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were thousands of familiars who roamed the underground city that was Elfin Stone’s home.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They became Elfin Stone’s eyes and ears when he was awake.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone knew that Grid’s group had slaughtered the vampires in the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The city will be completely destroyed in the near future if this is left alone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone didn’t care about the deaths of the ordinary vampires. He could always raise more.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the True Blood vampires were different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Only Shizo Beriache and her immediate family could create them. They were precious resources. It was troublesome to lose them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have to eat two people from today onwards.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He would keep the black haired man alive until the end.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would leave the most delicious food to last.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'He sold out his companion, but in the moment when he accepts death, will he feel despair?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was fun to imagine the people crying.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Elfin Stone maximized his outward appearance by changing into a white tailcoat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He strolled out of his mansion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His destination was the location of Grid’s party.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Which one should I eat?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the thick darkness.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone’s red eyes burned as he sniffed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was to distinguish between the members of Grid’s party.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would hunt Pon and Regas today.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'It is better to get rid of those two first.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In fact, the assassin called Faker was the most annoying.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Regas and Pon were a little bit stronger than Faker. Their physical strength was good, so it would be annoying if they were left alive for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If he took care of them first, he could enjoy the slow hunt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Then I am going.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Sururuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone turned into black smoke and completely assimilated with the darkness.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He approached Grid like lightning, at a speed that far exceeded Faker’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Now! Give me your fresh blood!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Humans were truly inferior.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No one noticed that he was approaching above their heads.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This stupidity was funny.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Elfin Stone ridiculed them and used Extreme Blood Transfusion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His target was Pon.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puhahahak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A blood curtain stretched out towards Pon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now Pon would be destroyed and his health would become Elfin Stone’s food.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was normal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’ve been waiting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The black haired man called Grid!&nbsp;</span><span style="">The man behind Pon was staring at him?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A human noticed my approach? This has never happened before.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He didn’t know what was happening. But it was too late.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Extreme Blood Transfusion was already used and Pon would soon die.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was Elfin Stone’s unshakable faith.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid broke that faith.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Just like the other bosses that Grid hunted, Elfin Stone was forced to feel confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Revolve.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an unbelievable sight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Extreme Blood Transfusion heading towards Pon was caught by Grid’s greatsword and turned back towards Elfin Stone?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Heok!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Extreme Blood Transfusion was the strongest magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t avoid being wounded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone turned pale and hurriedly tried to turn to smoke.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was neutralized by the golden spear that stabbed his side.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this...?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puhahahak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The blood curtain swallowed up Elfin Stone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This process happened in a short amount of time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">All the Overgeared members nervously waiting for Elfin Stone to appear were surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid suddenly moved and Elfin Stone fell wounded from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Cough! Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone vomited blood on the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The face beautiful enough to captivate a man was distorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The angry and confused Elfin Stone immediately got up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The terrible notification windows popped up in front of the Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The master of the 13th city, Vampire Earl Elfin Stone has appeared.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A strong evil influence is making your magic power turbid. All types of spells and skills aren’t available.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A vampire’s gaze will subdue lower species. Your body is subjected to a strong oppression.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members were helpless.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At least two to three skills were sealed and all speeds reduced, so their minds and bodies felt very heavy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid was fine.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a resistance only given to legendary classes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was able to exert his strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Blood Field!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone sealed some of the powers of the humans with his evil influence, and he didn’t miss this gap to use a skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, he attempted to use it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was before Blood Field was completed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid rushed at a speed comparable to the assassin called Faker and stabbed his blue greatsword at Elfin Stone’s heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His magic power flowed backwards and Blood Field was stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This guy, he wasn’t affected by the evil influence?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid gazed calmly at the disbelieving Elfin Stone. It was a cold look.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“My share ends here. After this, it’s Huroi’s share.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the past, Grid found it difficult to control his emotions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His personality was immature and he lacked social skills, often making him go on a rampage when he was angry, sad or happy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now it was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The experience of sacrificing his close friend made Grid fully aware of what it meant to be ‘on top.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now he was able to stay calm, despite being filled with anger and a desire for vengeance.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pit!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pipipipipit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Link.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The sword was wielded dozens of times without a time difference in an unshaken and sophisticated manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuaaaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On this day, Elfin Stone screamed for the second time since he had been born.</span></p>
