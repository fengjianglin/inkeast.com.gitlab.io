 <p><span style="">Chapter 237</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had a lot of experience with items enhancement. Grid had done a lot of enhancement compared to the other users of Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid took advantage of his passive skill that ‘increased the probability of enhancement’ to enhance the guild members’ items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There’s no trick to enhancement.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Enhancement wasn’t affected by stats such as dexterity.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Superstitions such as enhancing at certain times, or repairing the item first before enhancement were useless.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The success was purely based on luck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a truth he had learned from countless enhancements.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Umm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid looked at the dozens of enhancement stones in his inventory.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was extremely nervous. He was more nervous than when he went to see his first love, Ahyoung.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I need either the greatsword or the boots to reach at least +7...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Would he be successful?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Would his hair loss return if he received damage from this?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a matter of money, so he was bound to be more sensitive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">God, Buddha, goddess Rebecca, etc.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid prayed earnestly to the gods that existed in the game and reality, then started the enhancement with trembling hands.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The discussion on the mine development and alchemy investment funding was over.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The results were positive because Lauel and Rabbit were in agreement.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the Overgeared members who left the meeting room weren’t happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We’re going to suffer over the next few months.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Vantner grumbled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had a mission to destroy the monsters around the path from Reidan to Alzar Mountain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wouldn’t the monsters just respawn if they were killed? At least 10 giant worm nests needed to be destroyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 17 Overgeared members working with Vantner sighed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Pon envied them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'It’s better than me...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon was commanded to identity all the dungeons and boss monsters in the west. It was a mission to investigate which hunting ground would give them the most money.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was in charge, since it was a highly difficult mission.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas, who received the mission with him, smiled and spoke. “It’s interesting. Let's take this opportunity to challenge a two person raid.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Regas’ dream to grow stronger through struggling.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pon had to be with this ignorant guy whose brain was made up of muscles. He could see a rocky path in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel encouraged them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Our roles are important while Grid is away. Let’s take responsibility by raising our levels and developing the city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid is going to the Saharan Empire?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, he says there is an important quest from Piaro.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The empire... I hope that Grid doesn’t encounter any bumps in the road.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The world was wide and there were a lot of monsters. And most of the monsters were in the empire.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The spacious fields of Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro was standing where wheat had started to grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Looking at his sweaty appearance, he really was like a farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Bland and the workers saw a welcome face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Duke Grid is coming here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The eyes of all the workers turned to one side at once.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was really the lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">People cheered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hooray Duke Grid! Hooray Duke Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The people of Reidan had one mindset.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They cheered every time they saw Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t because someone forced them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The people were just absolutely loyal to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The enhancement was good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A blue energy was rising like a haze from Grid’s boots.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s smile wasn’t because Piaro noticed quickly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was able to strengthen both the Doppelganger’s Greatsword and Grid’s Boots to +8.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was lucky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In this event, his knowledge of Pagma’s Swordsmanship increased, he got a doppelganger for a pet, and he found a yellow mithril mine.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Everything was going well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid wanted to maintain this momentum.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I think that now is the time to get your revenge. I will head to the empire.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His eyes were determined.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro felt a strong trust in Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I believe you can get the job done.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A quest has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The True Traitor of the Red Knights]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Difficulty Level: SS</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Asmophel dared to rendezvous with the empress and was caught by Piaro. Piaro and his men were framed and branded as traitors.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Due to that, he lost his men and had to flee. Now Piaro has no intention of forgiving Asmophel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, it is virtually impossible for Piaro to get revenge himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro has made you his agent of revenge.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Conditions: Kill Asmophel, the former vice captain of the Red Knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Reward: Piaro’s affinity will reach the peak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Failure: Level -6.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Would you like to accept the quest?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It has changed in many ways.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the past when Grid was a beginner, the level of difficulty for this quest was S-grade. And the quest rewards were the title of ‘Agent of Revenge’ and Piaro’s sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now the difficulty had been raised and the rewards changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a phenomenon that occurred when his relationship with Piaro improved and Piaro’s heart stabilized.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What will happen if my affinity with Piaro reaches the maximum?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was it possible he would teach Grid his sword techniques?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘That won’t happen.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s swordsmanship belonged to his family. It wouldn’t be easy to teach others.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid thought about it differently.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Will he become my subordinate?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s power was beyond imagination.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If Grid could obtain Piaro as a subordinate, it would be like obtaining a group of men.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was filled with great expectations and accepted the quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Believe in me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro saw his confidence and warned him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I’ve said it before, but the empire is full of strong people. The process to approach Asmophel was difficult, so be cautious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid answered well, but he wasn’t particularly nervous.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro spoke again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Don’t trust your techniques. The two sword technique isn’t something that can be completely handled with such a short amount of training.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had practiced dual wielding on the way back from the doppelganger raid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid nodded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Don’t worry, I know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid replied like this, but his inner intentions were different.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Right now I’m lacking, but that will change over time.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His destination was the capital of the empire, Titan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It would take at least 20 days to arrive. If he practiced steadily on the way, he would be able to use the two sword style sufficiently.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was possible because Piaro trained him well in the basics.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The empire was the center of the world.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was natural for the empire to be the master of the continent, and it was right for kingdoms outside the empire to obey them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a very arrogant and selfish thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But no kingdom could condemn them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The power of the Saharan Empire was overwhelming.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This is the village of the Ul Clan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The master of the White Wolf Guild, Veradin, was a baron of the empire.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He received an order from Earl Zebra to subjugate the immigrants, and he finally found the base of the enemy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the accomplishment at the end of a one week journey.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Veradin was cautious.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“How many enemies?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kiki, a sniper used the Hawk’s Eyes skill and reported.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“1,050 people. More than half of them are women and young children.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It meant that less than 500 people could fight properly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Veradin was relieved.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There’s no need for tactics. Rush from the front and wipe them out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kiki’s reaction was unsure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"No matter how I think about it, this isn’t something that people should do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Ul Clan were ordinary humans rather than monsters.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were a poor clan because they weren’t designated as citizens of the empire.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a pity, because they were once a flourishing nation until they were deprived of their land by the empire. The few remaining people chose to hide in the most remote areas.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kiki was unwilling to kill them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Veradin rebuked her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“They’re just NPCs. Don’t be shaken by unnecessary sentiments.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If they killed the Ul Clan, their contribution to the empire would increase by 12 per person.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Veradin wanted to build a foundation to become a viscount by performing this quest perfectly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kiki sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sigh... I wish a golem army would arrive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the story about the golem invasion that took place in the Eternal Kingdom several months ago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Naturally, Grid’s name emerged.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That Grid brat was really lucky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right. He happened to become a duke in one shot by killing the golem army that invaded the kingdom by chance."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah! I’m envious! If we belonged to the Eternal Kingdom, we would’ve been able to defeat the golems and occupied a duke’s seat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As the guild members started talking about unnecessary things, Veradin scolded them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Focus on the mission.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The guild members restored their posture.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unlike Kiki, they didn’t show any resistance to hunting the Ul Clan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Weren’t NPCs just a lump of graphics and artificial intelligence?&nbsp;</span><span style="">They resembled people, but weren’t actually people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was easy to kill them. It was nothing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Veradin confirmed that the guild members were emanating a fighting spirit and ordered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Trample them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Waaaaahhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Except for Kiki, 24 guild members went down the mountain together.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a tremendous speed. They didn’t slow down despite the rugged rocks. The Ul Clan discovered them along the way and fired arrows and magic from the watchtower. However, it was useless. They avoided or defended against all attacks and quickly reached the goal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Get lost!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Thanks for the contribution~”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an unbelievable situation where only 24 people wiped out 1,000 people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The small village soon turned into a hell.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a one-sided massacre.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"P-Please, my only daughter...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Just die quietly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">People begged, but the White Wolf guild members had no mercy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The women, children, and elderly were murdered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the cruel killing didn’t last long.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m not the boy detective, so why do incidents happen everywhere I go? Well, I got a quest and it isn’t too bad...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The White Wolf members were confused.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because a user, not an NPC, emerged from one corner of the village.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Who is that person?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was wearing a broad-brimmed hat so his appearance and ID couldn’t be determined.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The White Wolf members asked the man.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Me?"&nbsp;</span><span style="">The man held a jade greatsword in his hand and replied,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“This time I am the Apostle of Justice.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Veradin’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The same man appeared behind Veradin’s ally and stabbed him?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A clone...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t a normal clone. It was the first time he saw a clone that could exert such power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A high level user!’</span></p>
