 <p><span style="">Chapter 83</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The remaining time for the quest was two hours!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then I finished the plating for one shield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The information of the finished item popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Divine Shield]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Rare</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 360/360 &nbsp;Defense: 189 &nbsp;Magic Resistance: 150</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* There is a rare chance of completely resisting dark spells.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An item made by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but his experience and reputation is somewhat lacking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to the power of Cassus, a priest of the Rebecca Church, it shines with the divine power of the goddess of light. Due to its strength against dark magic, all followers of demons and the Yatan Church will suffer when facing this shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 190 or higher. More than 500 strength. More than 1,000 divine power. A member of the Rebecca Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 800&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A rare rated item was produced, so all stats have permanently risen by +2 and reputation throughout the continent has risen by +30.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“T-This is shit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The first final product was a rare rated shield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was hoping for it to have at least the epic rating, so I was beyond frustrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...One of my hopes has disappeared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I invested almost all my fortune in making these two shields. If the next shield was rare rated and this quest failed, it would be hard for me to break even.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As I shook from the anger that I couldn’t endure, Cassus spoke. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The other one will be finished with good results.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I exclaimed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I thought you said that praying would have a clear effect! But what is this? Does a god really exist?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Cassus didn’t say anything, despite being the target of my venting. There was no change in his expression, but he seemed to think I was being absurd. I had been stuck with him for the last two days, so it was possible to read his expressionless face to a certain extent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah...I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I shouldn’t blame the innocent Cassus. It was just my dirty luck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I apologized and carefully finished plating the remaining shield. Then...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Perfect Divine Shield]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Legendary</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 680/680 &nbsp;Defense: 370 &nbsp;Magic Resistance: 280</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* There is a high chance of completely resisting dark spells.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The skill ‘Divine Light’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The skill ‘Divine Favor’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An item made by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but his experience and reputation is somewhat lacking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to the power of Cassus, a priest of the Rebecca Church, it shines with the divine power of the goddess of light. Due to its strength against dark magic, all followers of demons and the Yatan Church will suffer when facing this shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 190 or higher. More than 500 strength. More than 1,000 divine power. A member of the Rebecca Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 800&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[An legendary rated item was produced, so all stats have permanently risen by +25 and reputation throughout the continent has risen by +1,000.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“K-Keok!” </span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was so surprised that my breath was blocked for a moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Cassus’ pallid face smiled for the first time as he looked closely at the shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Congratulations."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His pale skin and eyes gave off a bad impression when he was emotionless, but he looked good when he smiled like this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I felt some appreciation towards Cassus for the first time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is all thanks to your prayers!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It is Goddess Rebecca’s divine favor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes! That's right! Goddess Rebecca, hooray! Hooray! Hooray!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Goddess Rebecca is eternal. Don’t cheer for her like that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Ah, yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Now, let’s return to the administrator.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Understood!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I placed the shields in my inventory and rushed off quickly, filled with a desire to show the shields to the administrator as quickly as possible. However, Cassus didn’t lag behind my speed, despite only seeming like he was walking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is he walking so fast because his legs are long?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">We arrived at the administrator’s office as I was thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You came.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The administrator who always greeted me energetically was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘His face doesn’t look good. Did he have a fight with his wife? But his depressed mood will be gone the moment he sees this!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I handed the legendary Divine Shield to the administrator.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Now, how about this? Isn’t it impressive? No, isn’t it amazing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The administrator didn’t say anything. He just looked closely at the Divine Shield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Heh, he was struck speechless.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Last time I made a legendary sword, and now it was a legendary shield!&nbsp;</span><span style="">He must be wondering if it was possible for such a great blacksmith to exist in the world, while also being confused over whether this was a dream or not.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Even I am wondering if this is a dream.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As the number of items that I made increased, I couldn’t help getting a feeling.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In order to create high rated items, it was necessary to have good luck, quality materials, time invested, and effort.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The first item I made in Bairan Village were the epic rated Special Jaffa Arrows, so I thought it was easy to make an epic rated item.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But what was the truth? I was mistaken.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Since I made a unique rated dagger in a short time period during the item making game with Euphemina, I thought it was easy to make unique rated items for a while.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But what was the truth? I was once again mistaken.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Making a legendary item is like winning the lottery.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Once I concluded that, I suddenly remembered Cassus’ prayer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Maybe the prayer really did have an effect.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was sincerely grateful for his hard work in praying for the two days that I made the items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I turned my gaze towards Cassus. He was once again expressionless, but I didn’t feel uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I smiled at Cassus. Then his expression stiffened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Do you have any complaints towards me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was my smiling face that strange?&nbsp;</span><span style="">One day, I would have to practice smiling in front of a mirror.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was seriously considering it when the administrator opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Good work.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huh? What was this boring reaction? Didn’t he originally make a fuss?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was the one who made a fuss when I first came with the Sword of Self-transcendence, so why was he so calm this time?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">While I was surprised by the unexpected reaction, the administrator said to me.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I will determine the value as soon as possible. You should go back for today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Didn’t you price the Sword of Self-transcendence immediately? Why do I have to go back empty handed today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There is a financial crisis due to the recent war. I will set a price after meeting with the lady.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Hrmm, okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was convinced and extended a hand towards the administrator.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The administrator asked with confusion,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“This hand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What?&nbsp;</span><span style="">I pointed to the Divine Shield in the administrator’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That, give it to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The administrator frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Why do I need to give it back?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was wrong with this old man today? Did he take the wrong medication?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Isn’t it natural to return the item to the owner?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Owner? Are you the owner of this shield?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Then whose is it if it isn’t mine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You...what are you saying? The owner of this shield is someone we can’t go against...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The administrator’s face reddened. He seemed sincerely angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Someone we can’t go against? Is he talking about Lady Irene? Anyway, money hasn’t been paid yet, so isn’t this shield mine? I am exercising ownership over my property, so why is he so angry?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As I was feeling strange towards the administrator,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Guards! Come and capture this person!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The guards outside the administrator’s office were summoned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Four guards armed with armor and spears rushed into the office. Then hesitated when they saw I was the target, but eventually followed orders and seized me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was frustrated and offended.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“What are you doing right now? Why are you capturing an innocent person? Isn’t this misconduct?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The administrator held the shield tightly and exclaimed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Shut up! I treated you well due to your accomplishments in the past, yet you dare to go beyond your means!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Excuse me? It is common sense. Who is the one in the wrong right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But the administrator didn’t bother talking to me anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Lock him in the castle’s dungeon right now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? Y-You crazy person!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment that the administrator was about to leave the office with the Divine Shield...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wait there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Cassus blocked the administrator’s way. Then he drew a cross over the administrator’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Light of Purification.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chwaaaaak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A brilliant light flashed through the office.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The light wasn’t intense enough to hurt my eyes. Rather, the light gave off a restful feeling.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the administrator looked around with surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh? What is this situation? What is everybody doing here? Grid, why are the guards capturing you? Eh? What is this shield? Why am I holding something like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Did the administrator already have dementia, despite only being middle-aged?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The administrator was crying out with confusion. Then he suddenly staggered and fell down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A-Administrator?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As the guards rushed to support him, Cassus approached me and said.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Indeed, the administrator was brainwashed by the Yatan Church.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Brainwashed?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Didn’t it say from the beginning? Only members of the Rebecca Church can handle the Divine Shield. There is no one in Winston who can use the Divine Shield. Even if the Divine Shield is owned, it is impossible for Winston to use it to defend against the Yatan Church. So why did the administrator ask you to create the Divine Shield?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Come to think of it...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I was suspicious from the time the administrator asked the Rebecca Church to send a priest to make the Divine Shield. If the administrator was really trying to defend Winston using the Divine Shield, he would’ve asked not just for help to make it, but the support of a paladin to use the shield.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I see. I made a small mistake. So I was suspected.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One of the four guards supporting the fallen administrator muttered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Cassus’ gaze fell on the guard as a dark energy erupted from the guard’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then after a while, the darkness was lifted and the young guard became an old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I panicked and the rest of the guards were shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-Who are you? Where did Roy go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Their companion suddenly turned into an old man.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The old man waved his hand like the guards were annoying.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then black nails suddenly appeared in the air, killing the guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Cassus saw him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Dirty infidel, you dare to commit murder in front of a priest of Rebecca?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The old man laughed at Cassus while picking up the Divine Shield that the administrator had dropped.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“From my point of view, you are the dirty infidel.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Before the old man finished talking!&nbsp;</span><span style="">An explosion occurred and the wall of the office broke. A girl appeared from among the dust.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘Isabel’ was written in green above her head, and she was a pretty girl in an embroidered blue dress, making her seem reminiscent of a heroine from a manhwa.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then Cassus rebuked Isabel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Why did you go through the wall when there is a door?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Isabel gave a refreshing laugh.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Isn’t this cooler?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was going on now? What the hell was going on?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">I couldn’t understand the situation. Then Isabel raised a hand. A gold circle appeared in the air and a white spear emerged from it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The old man was shocked as he saw it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Lifael’s Spear...? D-Don’t tell me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What does the Yatan Church want with the Divine Shield?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Isabel smiled while holding the white spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Unbelievable! Why is Rebecca's Daughter here...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The old man was forced to run away from Isabel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shall we play?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Isabel licked the spear before chasing after the old man, with Cassus following her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was left alone in the office.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What is this? No, wait...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Something flashed through my head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hey, this crazy geezer! My shield!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I belatedly realized that the old man took my Divine Shield and rushed out of the office.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Isabel and Cassus were at the end of the corridor. I thought I would be able to chase the old man if I followed them, but I couldn’t keep up. Their running speed was on a different level from the general public.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I am going to miss them!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I squeezed out all my strength and ran.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">But in the end, I completely lost Isabel and Cassus.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pant... pant.. where? Which way did they go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Winston Castle was very large. There were hundreds of rooms.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I came to a point where it was impossible to figure out which direction Isabel and Cassus went in.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh...! It would be good if there were witnesses!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I wandered around the third floor of Winston Castle.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As I walked down the corridors, I waited for a new notification window to appear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What notification window was I waiting for?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Of course, it was the new quest notification window!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I invested huge amounts of materials into the le.gen.da.ry. shield, so there should be a quest to retrieve the shield from the old man!&nbsp;</span><span style="">But...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Five minutes later,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">10 minutes later,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">30 minutes passed and a new quest information window didn’t pop up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This really stinks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Random quests were always foisted on me, so why didn’t the desired quest appear in this situation?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shit! Shit! Is this a lie? Eh?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was it so easy to lose a legendary item that I made? Wouldn’t it sell for hundreds of millions of won?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No way...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was robbed of a legendary item!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Uncontrollable anger bubbled up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Uwaaaaaah! Gimme my shield, you @ ~ # $! &nbsp;I could pay off half my debt if I sold that, you #$!~^ jerks!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My shout contained all my heartbreak.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But my cry only echoed in the void.</span></p>
