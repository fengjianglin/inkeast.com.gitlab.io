 <p><span style="">Chapter 146</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid returned!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As soon as she heard the news, Jishuka rushed to Khan’s smithy from Winston Castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is he in a very angry state?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She imagined that Grid would be very frustrated by the Awakened Guardian of the Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘In the future, he should pay attention to the guild community.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She judged that it was a perfect opportunity to teach Grid about refusing even the basic communications and to fix his habit of doing personal actions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But what was this?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Jishuka? Why are you here?"&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had a bright expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why isn’t he depressed about failing the raid due to lack of information?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka was surprised by his unexpected appearance and asked,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Did you do the Guardian of the Forest raid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“How did you know? That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Were you successful?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Of course.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid replied like it was no big deal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'What? Did the Guardian of the Forest not awaken?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid complained to the bewildered Jishuka,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“But why did the guardian awaken? I suffered because it was a bit too strong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka was at a loss for words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He really beat the Awakened Guardian of the Forest? With no more than two knights and 100 soldiers?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It seemed like a lie.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka dubiously opened the guild information window. Then she checked Grid’s level.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had been level 180 just yesterday, and now he was level 200.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The fact that he succeeded in the Awakened Guardian of the Forest raid wasn’t false.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s outrageous.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She knew that the legendary class, Pagma’s Descendant was fraudulent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Apart from having a legendary blacksmith skill, Grid could demonstrate a level of combat similar to rare combat classes and could wear any equipment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Just that.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That alone was a scam.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the fraudulent legendary class was more than her imagination.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Isn’t one Grid bigger than the sum of all our guild members?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She calculated that it was impossible to defeat the awakened guardian with the current power of the Tzedakah Guild. But Grid succeeded in the raid alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka was mistaken.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Reality was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reason that Grid could take care of the awakened guardian relatively easily was thanks to pavranium and Braham’s Boots.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was able to win because he blocked the guardian’s attacks with the pavranium, then he attacked the defenseless guardian from the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What if Grid fought against the entire guild?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t shield himself from all the attacks with just two pieces of pavranium, and he wouldn’t be able to defend against firepower in the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was the five seconds of invulnerability, but that couldn’t last long against so many people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Tzedakah Guild were powerful and composed of a variety of classes, allowing them various tactical combinations. It would be too much for Grid alone to overwhelm the Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Jishuka didn’t know the details and misunderstood Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is beyond a balance collapse. Isn’t it at the level of a bug?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She started to worry.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were some spies from the Yatan Church in Bairan Village.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She didn’t know when there would be a massive raid from the Yatan Church in retaliation for defeating Malacus.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was it okay to let Grid’s power be used as just a blacksmith in this situation?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka felt greedy for Grid’s combat ability.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid, do you want to migrate to Bairan…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Jishuka.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The two people spoke at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid wasn’t interested in what Jishuka had to say. He didn’t give her a chance to speak as he continued.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“If there isn’t anything special, can you go? I personally have something to do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was the guild’s blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was obliged to produce their items. But he kept doing personal activities.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka felt like shouting, but she suddenly changed her mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There were no conditions when he joined and I promised him freedom, so maybe he will leave if I push too much?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka bent over slightly. She slightly emphasized her chest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She had grasped from the beginning that Grid was vulnerable to large breasts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will make him out of his mind first.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She thought it would be simple to make Grid dazed, but he didn’t even blink.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had lost his virginity, so breasts didn’t affect him as much as before.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? You aren’t going?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh? Y-Yes. I’m going.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka turned red with embarrassment before his reaction was too cold. She covered her chest with both hands and ran away from the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Bah, what is this? Was he better as an idiot?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Two months ago, Grid was stupid, stingy, and easy to handle. But now that his personality had changed, he was hard to deal with.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It made her sad.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Just because you have become a little big? Idiot!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka walked down the street and angrily kicked a flower pot.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was a beautiful and famous celebrity, and she acted in public, so rumors spread in minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were even articles on the Internet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Tzedakah’s guild master creating a disturbance on the street.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[According to the testimony of a witness, a man is believed to have broken her heart.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[(Column) Jishuka is sexy even when angry! Let’s explore her charms!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Jishuka’s love is the martial artist Regas?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Jishuka has received a Hollywood love call...]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The day was filled with gossip about one of Satisfy’s two beauties, Jishuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, Grid was inside Khan’s smithy and didn’t know what was happening out in the world.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wasted time due to Jishuka’s arrival, so he quickly moved towards the furnace.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he took out the hammer he had been using for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Unknown Blacksmith’s Hammer]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 350/350 &nbsp;Attack Power: 70~80&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Odds of Making a Rare Rated Item: +17%&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Odds of Making an Epic Rated Item: +7%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A blacksmith’s hammer made by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but his experience and reputation is somewhat lacking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This is a hammer produced by the craftsman himself, so it isn’t suitable for other blacksmiths to use.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Conditions of Use: Pagma’s Descendant</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 80</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'This is lacking.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Currently, he had 17 blue orichalcum. He only had one chance to produce Failure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid wanted to raise his odds as much as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Failure is a supreme weapon. I have to finish it with the highest rating.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid wanted to complete Failure with a legendary rating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Failure]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Unique ~ Legendary</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Failure was an item that was guaranteed to have a unique rating when produced.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The basic performance was fraudulent, so a unique rating didn’t change the fact that it was an absolute weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, human greed was endless!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid would feel like it was lacking if he completed it with a unique rating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I’ll finish it with a legendary rating.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was the key to making a legendary rated item?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had produced thousands of items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He always did his best. He invested at least 20 hours into making one item.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the experience of obtaining satisfactory results was small enough to fit in one hand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He only made three legendary items, while normal and rare rated items emerged like a factory.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have to increase the chances of making legendary items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What did he need to do?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was to make a legendary rated hammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Let's make a hammer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It had been a long time since Grid used blacksmith tools instead of a greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Once started, the flames in the furnace never turned off.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid also didn’t stop his hammering.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid solely devoted himself to the task, regardless of whether it was day or not.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Due to the heat from the fire and Grid’s enthusiasm, it seemed like Khan’s smithy was on the brink of an explosion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"There will be no guests.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan was concerned about disturbing Grid’s concentration, so he locked the doors of the smithy. Then he did his best to assist Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Time passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The five hammers that Grid produced were rated normal, rare, epic, rare and rare.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was frustrated by the repeated failures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, his mentality had matured and tried his best to the end without shaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then on the fifth day.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The item he wanted finally came.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Legendary Blacksmith’s Hammer]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Legendary</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 550/550 &nbsp;Attack Power: 130~150</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Odds of Making a Rare Rated Item: +30%&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Odds of Making an Epic Rated Item: +20%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Odds of Making a Unique Rated Item: +8%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Odds of Making a Legendary Rated Item: +1%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The amount of experience acquired for production related skills will increase.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A blacksmith’s hammer made by a craftsman with great skills and potential, and is accumulating his experience and reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This is a hammer produced by the craftsman himself, so it isn’t suitable for other blacksmiths to use.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Conditions of Use: Pagma’s Descendant</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 50</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[An legendary rated item was produced, so all stats have permanently risen by +25 and reputation throughout the continent has risen by +1,000.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the moment when Grid’s fourth legendary item was born after the Sword of Self-transcendence, Divine Shield, and Thorn of Deep Grievance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid frowned, rather than being pleased with the result that was obtained faster than expected.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It isn’t much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He couldn’t help being disappointed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The 20% chance of making epic items and 8% chance of making unique items were high enough that they couldn’t be ignored. He was pleased by this outcome.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he wasn’t pleased that the chance of making a legendary item only increased by 1%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I don’t think that a 1% increase will actually help... No, no. This is more than I expected.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid thought about it positively as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Considering the number of items he had made so far, his chances of making a legendary item had been less than 0.1%.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Having this increase by 1% would clearly have a great effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Based on simple calculations, one out of 100 items would be legendary rated, so wasn’t this good?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The probability had skyrocketed compared to the thousands he needed to make in the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s only the odds, but it’s a lot better than before.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t delay.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After five days of work, his concentration was at its peak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Now...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid held the Legendary Blacksmith’s Hammer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he started smelting the blue orichalcum.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">His skilled hammering was repeated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The blue orichalcum was delicately tempered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan was amazed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As Grid hammered, the form of a blue shark slowly appeared on the anvil.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was this hot smithy the cool sea? The shark was lively enough to give off the illusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is unbelievable.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The transparent shark-shaped greatsword was amazing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">To Khan, it was far more creative and practical than anything made by the dwarves.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s hammering didn’t stop until the sun fell and the moon rose and became faint again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Patience skill has been activated. Concentration, stamina and defense will rise to the extreme for one hour.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then when the chickens were crying at dawn.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath has increased the effectiveness of your production items]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had a rare bright smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Failure]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Legendary</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 1,090/1,090&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Attack Power: 1,040~2,166 &nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 80</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Agility +50</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* There is a low probability of blocking the enemy’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* There is a certain probability of activating the ‘5 Joint Attacks’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* There is a high probability of activating the ‘Cutting’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The skill ‘Bisect’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* There will be a fear effect if the enemy is more than 20 levels lower than the user.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Attack power +20% in dark places.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It’s a weapon designed by a legendary blacksmith. It’s a greatsword, but its cutting ability is excellent because of its unique shape. It resembles the predator of the sea, a shark, and gives fear to enemies. The small blades spiking from the sword will increase the defense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Blue orichalcum is used as a material. Its lightness means the attack speed doesn’t fall. Due to the nature of the blue orichalcum, it becomes stronger in the dark.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 300 or higher. More than 5,000 strength. Advanced Sword Mastery level 8 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 550&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pachichik!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pachichik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">On the lower edge of the wide sword, the name ‘Grid’ started to be written in cursive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the moment when the item that Grid first created as Pagma’s Descendant was revealed to the world.</span></p>
