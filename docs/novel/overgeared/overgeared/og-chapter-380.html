 <p><span style="">Chapter 380</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">"One of my men came across you in a hunting ground... The weapon you used at that time looks exactly like one of Grid’s weapons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was probably referring to Grid’s Greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In this chilly atmosphere, Chris responded nervously.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will say it again. In this world, aren’t there one or two items that resemble each other?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris tried to leave as planned, but Zibal grabbed his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This isn’t like you, Chris. Originally, wouldn’t you be angry when receiving an unfair accusation like this? Are you just laughing because what I said was the truth?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I've only ever responded in a gentlemanly manner.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris firmly shoved at Zibal’s hand on his shoulder.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris had high strength due to all his labor, so Zibal wasn’t able to cope with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Don’t push people with unfounded rumors.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris spat out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t shrink back, despite knowing that no one was on his side.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the dignity of the third ranked user.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the opponent was Zibal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He might’ve been killed in one blow by a crazy farmer, but his strength and influence among the users was absolute.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No matter how high Chris’ charisma, Zibal wasn’t affected at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“If you’re so confident, why don’t you share the details of your weapon with us?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ssik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal suggested with a bright smile.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t have anything to lose in this situation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If the weapon information was revealed and it was related to Grid, Zibal would be right. Otherwise, he could apologize if it was unrelated to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris faltered for a moment before acting wisely.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Please don’t go overboard, Zibal. Who would reveal the information of their item?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Items could be a person’s strength or weakness, so it was always a variable.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Disclosing a weapon’s information was no different from revealing a private part.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The masters of the seven guilds knew this better than anyone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They tried to deter Zibal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Zibal, please act moderately. Don’t make trouble when you are already struggling with Overgeared and the Blood Carnival.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, why are you suddenly doing this to Chris?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The flow started to change.&nbsp;</span>It happened when Chris was feeling relieved.</p>
 <p><span style="">"Do you use the same weapon as Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The master of the Golden Guild, Seuron, stood up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A combat specialized unique class, Soul Predator.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He might’ve been defeated by the crazy farmer during the Reidan invasion, but Seuron hadn’t fully adapted to his class at the time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But now it was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now Seuron would be able to fight the temporary and full-time farmers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I don’t want to obediently send away a person who might be the enemy of our alliance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Seuron spoke meaningful words and raised his Brutal Heavy Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After being defeated by the temporary farmer, he invested more than 10 million gold to increase it to a +9 weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His finances suffered quite a blow, but Seuron was satisfied. The gap between a +9 and a +8 weapon was large.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hey, Chris. Take out your weapon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Seuron’s goal was to be number one.&nbsp;</span><span style="">By default, he was aggressive so he didn’t want to miss a chance to kill a competitor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You don’t intend to bring it out obediently? Then I will make you take it out.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pa pa pa pat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Four spears appeared in thin air on Seuron’s left and right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the manifestation of the Soul Spears, which required a human or monster soul to be summoned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sueron accumulated the maximum number of souls through continuous hunting, so he was in the best condition.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The soul spears shone as they shot forward.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a very fast attack that was hard for Chris to deal with, because he invested most of his points in strength instead of agility.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Two spears pierced Chris’ body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Seuron used this time to approach Chris with the Brutal Heavy Sword while using Soul Shackles.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris stood at the crossroads of choice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Should he take out Grid’s Greatsword, or take out a second weapon to block it?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have no choice.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris had no intention of deepening the false accusation that he had an alliance with Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His guild would be damaged if he became hostile to these people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, Chris pulled out his secondary weapon.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hoh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Seuron’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He admired the fact that Chris struck the Soul Shackles and blocked his sword the moment he took out his weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Chris’ control is greater than rumored.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were slow and efficient movements. It allowed for the maximum effect with minimal movements.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris’ greatsword technique was truly brilliant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“But.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He wasn’t Seuron’s opponent.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Yiing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The sword that was engaged with Chris’ greatsword was reinforced with the effect of Soul Transference.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris’ strength became meaningless.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As the weapon’s attack power was enhanced, Chris started to be pushed back.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This game was truly about items. Chris realized again as he was pushed back a few steps.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Soul Arrows flew towards his head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris sensed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'It’s a combo!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If he was hit by continuous attacks, the probability of falling into a stiffened state was very high.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And top rankers were able to fully take advantage of that moment of stiffness.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris prepared for pain and suffering.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Suddenly, the arrows pouring down on him were shattered by a chain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hao intervened in the battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Seuron, don’t just do whatever you like.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were many crazy people in the world.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t unusual for someone to enjoy fighting like Seuron.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there was an appropriate line.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hao didn’t understand Zibal and Sueron, who were trying to make someone big like Chris into an enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hey Hao. Isn’t Chris suspicious? Look at the weapon that he brought out. It’s complete rubbish! Do you think that is his real weapon? He’s hiding his weapon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Let’s say Chris’ weapon and Grid’s weapon are the same. Is that solid proof that the two are colluding?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao asked logically and Seuron fell silent. Bubat also started to help Hao.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He shook a hand towards Seuron and Chris.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let them play. It isn’t bad to experience each other’s ability ahead of the National Competition. Isn’t it beneficial?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Seuron shook.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He already concluded that Chris was below him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That wasn’t all.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Everyone in this place thought so.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a very short fight, but it was true that Seuron completely overwhelmed Chris.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...I’m going if there isn’t anything else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris stepped back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It felt like he was a dog retreating with his tail down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"To think that he is 3rd in the rankings. How pathetic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Seuron laughed at Chris.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Seuron and everyone in this room couldn’t imagine it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris actually hid his skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There will be many opportunities in the future.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">And the best stage was only 40 days away.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris’ eyes filled with fighting spirit.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Weapons Mastery.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the ultimate mastery skill that gave extra damage no matter what weapon was equipped.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it wasn’t a miracle.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The extra damage that Weapons Mastery gave was low compared to the mastery skills optimized for only one weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Therefore, Grid was obsessed with the level of Bow Mastery.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If Weapons Mastery added 10% additional damage and Bow Mastery added 11% additional damage, the effect that Grid would gain when he was using a bow was Bow Mastery, not Weapons Mastery.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In other words, even if Grid later learned Weapons Mastery, Bow Mastery could be used to the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If I can give items an option that quickly increases the experience of the mastery skills...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How good would it be?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t intend to use the alchemy facility.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Alchemy gave random options and the success rate was low, so he couldn’t rely on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Khan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In this situation, Grid tried to get Khan’s advice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan’s was an advanced level 8 blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As well as being excellent in daily life, he had accumulated experience for decades, making him very knowledgeable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Have you ever heard of an item that can quickly increase the experience of mastery skills?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hrmm..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan’s family had been in the blacksmithing business for generations. Among his ancestors was Albatino, who inspired the legendary blacksmith Pagma.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan looked through his decades of knowledge and finally shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m sorry... I don’t know...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had always been a big help to Khan. He wanted to pay Grid back if he ever got the chance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now he couldn’t help Grid when he needed it, making Khan feel depressed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His shoulders were sagging when he had a thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Perhaps you should ask Piaro.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Piaro?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, shouldn’t he know how to train in weapons more efficiently? If you listen to him, you might gain an idea about how to add it to an item.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the power of infinite favorability.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan freely gave Grid advice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid gained great enlightenment and hugged Khan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Thank you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Haha! I’m happy to help!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The sight of the two people hugging was familiar to the blacksmiths of Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The blacksmiths just looked away, trying not to interfere in the relationship between Grid and Khan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, Lord was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Abubu...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lord was hammering in a corner of the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was happy to hear his father’s voice, only to get question marks above his head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lord couldn’t understand why his father was hugging someone other than his mother.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the darkness, Kasim whispered to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This is the friendship between men.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Woo...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He liked the sound of the word ‘friendship.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lord vowed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Someday, he would find himself wonderful friends.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Later, Lord would have the strongest colleagues.&nbsp;</span></p>
