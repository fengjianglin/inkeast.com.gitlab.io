 <p><span style="">Chapter 235</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a small book kept in a firmly locked box.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was someone’s diary.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The first few chapters were filled with crooked letters like a child had written it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Summer, Year 259 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I met a child who looked exactly like me in the forest on the way out of the village.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The person said hello! I also smiled and greeted the child.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Year 259...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"146 years ago."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a diary from a long time ago. It was remarkably well preserved without anything being erased.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid turned to the next chapter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Winter, Year 259 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I went to the forest for the first time in a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The child who looked exactly like me was wearing summer clothes. I took off my hat and scarf and gave it to the child, who laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Winter, Year 259 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I told my dad about the child in the forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My dad became angry. He said the child was a dangerous monster. He told me not to meet the child again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The child in this diary is the doppelganger?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Indeed."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Not all monsters were aggressive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were monsters that attacked humans first, and those that didn’t.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Doppelganger of the Mysterious Forest seemed to be a gentle monster in the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If this guy was like this, why did he attack us first?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid and the Overgeared members had questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Spring, Year 260 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dad said that child in the forest was dangerous, but he didn’t know.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I went to see her again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The child treasured the hat and scarf that I gave her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hello!” I greeted her. She replied with those words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">We promised to be friends.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Spring, Year 260 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I named my friend Randy. My name is Wendy and together, we’ll look like sisters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Autumn, Year 260 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Randy now speaks very well. She can follow everything that I say.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My good friend is smart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Winter, Year 260 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I played with Randy every day and was caught by my dad. Dad took out his bow, stating that he was going to kick Randy out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was scared and followed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My dad saw Randy’s greeting and couldn’t shoot the bow. Thank god.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Summer, Year 261 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My dad taught Randy how to use the bow. Now Randy is better at hunting than Dad.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to Randy, my family never goes hungry.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thank you Randy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But I like rabbit meat more than boar meat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The days in the diary flowed quickly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The young girl called Wendy spent her days pleasantly. Her father and her friend Randy gave her new experiences every day.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The feelings conveyed from the diary were happy, so the hearts of Grid and the Overgeared members became warm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Unfortunately, the contents of the diary started to enter a new phase.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was when Wendy’s handwriting started to mature.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Spring, Year 270 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There seems to be an amazing mine behind our house. The villagers gathered together to check it, before saying that they should report it to the lord of Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Spring, Year 270 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The lord visited with dozens of knights. He told my dad to guide him to the mine.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The sight of the lord watching me was somewhat unpleasant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Summer, Year 270 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Oh my god!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A gentleman more beautiful than me came to the mine. His dignified manner and fine skin was like a prince from a fairy tale.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The prince was concerned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The minds of humans are still too immature to bear this mineral.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is she talking about Pagma?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I was thinking the same thing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was sure of it after reading the contents of the diary.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As Rabbit guessed, there was a mine in this mountain, and the mineral there was so huge that Pagma had to pay attention to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Yellow mithril.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid kept reading the diary.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Autumn, Year 270 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The lord declared that he would develop the mine. Then he ordered me to pour him a drink.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As I was serving him, the lord kept touching my hips.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was uncomfortable, but refrained because he was the lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Autumn, Year 270 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The lord said he would make me his concubine.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What is a concubine?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">When I asked my father what that meant, he just shed tears.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Autumn, Year 270 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The villagers told me. There were one or two women who went to become the lord’s concubines, but they were all treated as playthings.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Everyone is worried about me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Scary...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Winter, Year 270 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I explained the matter to Randy, stating that I would need to leave home soon to become the lord’s concubine.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I don’t want to leave my father and Randy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I cried loudly and Randy patted my back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Randy is always nice. Winter with Randy wasn’t too cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Winter, Year 270 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It’s serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The lord tried to visit the mine, but was attacked by a monster in the Mysterious Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The identity of a monster is a doppelganger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Randy...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Spring, Year 271 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I heard that the angry lord organized an army to kill Randy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I’m worried about Randy and can’t sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Spring, Year 271 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As soon as dawn came, I went to Randy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Randy’s appearance was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She looked exactly the same as one of the lord’s knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I don’t like it. I will protect Wendy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Randy shouted at me to run away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No matter how I tried to persuade her, Randy wouldn’t step back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What if Randy was hurt?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was afraid and sad.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Since then...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In order to defend the girl called Wendy, the gentle doppelganger started attacking anyone who invaded the forest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had been fighting for 100 years.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The Guardian accessories were made by the doppelganger for this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What happened to Wendy in the end? Then how did the doppelganger take on Pagma’s appearance?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid and the Overgeared members became immersed in the diary.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Spring, Year 271 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It’s said that Randy defeated the army sent by the lord by herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It’s scary that many people died. But Randy was unharmed, so I was happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I went to Randy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Don’t worry. I’ll protect Wendy. Don’t worry, Wendy, don’t worry."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Randy repeatedly said the same thing while bleeding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She was seriously injured and couldn’t get up properly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I had been saving up herbs to treat Randy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Randy was impervious to the effects of the herbs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I will be with Randy tonight to look after her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Spring, Year 271 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A few days later, Randy’s wounds haven’t healed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">According to rumors, the lord is preparing a new army.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Please... Somebody please help Randy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Summer, Year 271 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was leaning on Randy’s shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Your killing originates from a noble heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The prince I saw last year appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Despite Randy swinging the sword, the prince hammered at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I yelled, but the prince didn’t stop. Randy’s body kept being hit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then something strange happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Randy’s wounds became better.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is this the concept of repair? The material that makes up the body of a doppelganger can be called a metal.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It seems so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It seemed like he could do it as well.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid thought before turning to the next chapter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Summer, Year 271 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This world is full of danger. Humans are threatened by monsters and are busy fighting among themselves, while the demons underground are helped by the Yatan Church.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The prince who called himself Pagma said difficult words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He smiled at me while patting Randy’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"There is a balance to be kept. If the present day Eternal Kingdom has the power to threaten the empire, it would cause great confusion. I will give you the right to use some of my strength, so you must defend this forest thoroughly. The consequence of that will result in Wendy’s safety.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Randy was smarter than me.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unlike me, Randy understood the words and nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then on this day.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Randy’s appearance changed into that of the beautiful prince.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Summer, Year 271 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Randy defeated the lord’s army.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This time, Randy wasn’t seriously injured.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thank god. But I was worried.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Randy’s atmosphere changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The warmth of his eyes felt a bit cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Winter, Year 271 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Randy continued to fight for the last few months.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The lord hired mercenaries after the army couldn’t defeat Randy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Randy warned me when I visited him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don't come here anymore. Wendy should stay with your dad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why...?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Aren’t we friends? Why are you rejecting me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I asked him and Randy explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m able to easily kill humans. And Wendy is a human. I... I’m scared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Randy looked lonely.&nbsp;</span><span style="">My heart hurts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Spring, Year 272 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I visited Randy today.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Randy acted as usual.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He told me to ‘Go back’ and then fell silent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t respond to any of my stories.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I’m sorry and scared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">More than anything, I am sorry.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Summer, Year 272 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Randy has killed many people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Are you okay?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was no answer from Randy. Now he didn’t even look at me. He just looked into the distance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He’s changing more and more.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Because of me...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Winter, Year 272 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My dad went to the village to sell leather and hasn’t returned for several days. I tried to visit the village, but Randy blocked my way.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He still didn’t speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Winter, Year 272 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I have to go to the village today!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I yelled at Randy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I spoke harshly when I said it wasn’t necessary for him to protect me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then Randy opened the way.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In retrospect, Randy looked very sad.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Winter, Year 272 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I arrived in the village and heard shocking news.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My dad was arrested by the lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His crime was conspiring with the doppelganger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The lord found out that my dad and I were close to Randy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It’s all my fault.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The sweet and pure Randy became covered in blood and my dad was suffering...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">All my fault.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Winter, Year 272 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The lord promised to release my father. Instead, I would become his concubine.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I have no other options.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Spring, Year 273 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I met Randy last night.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I couldn’t bear to tell him, who was trying to protect me, that I was leaving.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thank you, I’m sorry. And I can only say that I love you.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now I am leaving this house.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I will never be able to come back. However, I lied and told Randy I would be back after a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Today will be my last diary entry.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Poor Randy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner burst into tears.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unlike his rough appearance, he was very sensitive. Therefore, tears and snot were running down his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shit! Poor Randy! He struggled to protect Wendy, but in the end he couldn’t protect her! He didn’t even know that he couldn’t protect Wendy. &nbsp;Until now! For over 100 years, he has been waiting for Wendy to come back!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members were solemn.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They didn’t know the circumstances of the doppelganger and just thought he was a bad guy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid saw their depressed expressions and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Even if it wasn’t us, someday someone else would’ve done the same thing. It’s fortunate that we know how Randy was feeling due to this book.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a mature comment that they couldn’t believe.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“My Lord...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members comforted by Grid were impressed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They felt genuine respect for the ever-changing and growing Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid turned to the ‘real last chapter’ of the diary.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Summer, Year 286 of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The lord abandoned me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My soul and body that have become rags have finally found freedom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Mysterious Forest that I hadn’t returned to in 13 years.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Randy was waiting for me, looking just like he did in the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Randy...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were so many words I wanted to say.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I wanted to express my pain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But I didn’t want Randy’s heart to hurt, so I smiled as brightly as possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I’m back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the last chapter of the diary, small traces of blood could be seen.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It seemed like Wendy became sick while living the lonely life of the lord’s concubine.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“She died shortly after returning home. The doppelganger must not understand that humans have a different life-span and had been waiting until this day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Um...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid closed the diary.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then a notification window popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have learned a little more about the person called Pagma.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[There is a bond with Pagma. The growth rate of your skills will increase.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The legendary skills had the disadvantage that their effect and power were excellent, but the growth speed was slow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This would overcome that shortcoming.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was delighted by the unexpected harvest when the notification windows were renewed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have discovered the story of the Doppelganger of the Mysterious Forest.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Doppelganger of the Mysterious Forest that fell by your hands is now different from the past. Its intelligence, physical abilities and most of its memories have been degraded. But if you call it Randy, it will be delighted and follow you.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was an opportunity to get a new pet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid couldn’t resist.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will be your new friend.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttalkak.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid decided to put the diary back in its place. Then he ordered the Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"After confirming the mine, I will collect the doppelganger and return.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an expedition where he could obtain many things.</span></p>
