 <p><span style="">Chapter 154</span></p>

 <p><span style="">'This momentum...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Neberius was 123 years old this year. Thanks to receiving God Yatan’s blessing, he lived for a long time and had a lot of insights.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The covered man changed the battlefield with small actions?&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he was careless, he would receive a big injury.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Big injury? The slightest slip will kill me.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuwaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid descended to 10m above the ground and then accelerated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The air became turbulent and the earth shook.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A legendary class who had the strongest stats and evolved his skills to the highest level with his equipment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Neberius judged, ‘That strength is a scam. It isn’t possible.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Unfortunately, defense seemed impossible. He had the old body of a magician, so it was hard to avoid. Could he offset the power with a magic attack? He would have to consume a lot of magic power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were separate and wiser ways to deal with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have to neutralize it with gravity magic.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Neberius was a dark magician.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His ability to do magic wasn’t simply limited to attack and defense magic, so his quality was different from Malacus.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had the title of great magician and could use magic power of different attributes, as well as a wide variety of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Reverse Gravity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Neberius used the magic that best fit this current crisis.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment that Grid was about to sweep like a hawk snatching its prey...&nbsp;</span><span style="">He stopped in the air just before hitting Neberius with Kill. Then regardless of his will, he began to rise into the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the force of reversing gravity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shi...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid cursed as he floated like a balloon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His attack was judged as a MISS and the energy of Kill inside Failure was extinguished. Transcended Link and Kill, two of his strongest skills were consecutively neutralized so he couldn’t help feeling angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, Neberius and the building debris were also influenced by gravity and floated into the air. As if they were being sucked into a black hole, they quickly chased after Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The situation is reversed. Now it’s your turn to be attacked.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Neberius’ specialty was double casting.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He could complete two magic spells simultaneously with his mind and mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He triggered dark thunder balls and dark water balls.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pajik!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pajijik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Five spheres of electricity hit Grid’s body, affecting him from head to toe. Then three spheres of water exploded, damaging Grid and doubling the power of the electricity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid gave a terrible scream as his body was roasted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Neberius’ eyes sharpened as he observed Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘That divine armor resists dark magic but the probability isn’t 100%.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was lucky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Neberius felt relieved and eagerly started a magic rampage.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Hwaruruk!</span></i> <i><span style="">Chachak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Arrows of fire and ice were created in succession and flew towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It stinks.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was still dominated by Reverse Gravity and was unable to control his body in the air.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he compared his current state to a PC game, it was difficult to control because his directional keys seemed to be reversed?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 1,160 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 1,230 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The effect of the Holy Light Armor has been activated, resisting the dark magic.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 1,155 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Annoying.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had to allow the attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His Holy Light Armor alleviated 50% of magic damage and occasionally completely resisted the dark magic, but it was still a one-sided bombardment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Did he have to be a punching bag like this?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I don’t like it.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was already tired of the one-sided punching bag days of his past. Now he had to experience it again?&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘No more...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid rotated his body in the air and reversed his direction. Then he flew towards Neberius who was casting a magic spell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I won’t be one-sidedly hit anymore!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Reverse gravity?&nbsp;</span><span style="">That wasn’t a difficult problem when he thought about it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He controlled his body by thinking of the sky as the earth and the earth as the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His many combat experiences had improved the thinking ability of his brain and allowed him to quickly adjust to Reverse Gravity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You have no respect for the elderly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid who was falling towards the ground and Neberius who was flying into the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The collision of the two were inevitable since they were moving in a straight line.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Pagma’s Swordsmanship.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid accurately calculated the timing as he narrowed the distance to Neberius and triggered a skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Link!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was perfect timing. The moment that Neberius entered his attack range, the greatsword started to shine blue.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Neberius didn’t stay still. </span><i><span style="">Clack!</span></i><span style=""> He snapped his fingers and released Reverse Gravity.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Gravity returned to normal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Neberius and the building debris stopped flying up towards Grid, suddenly falling towards the ground instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid missed the target once again and Link only hit empty air.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the third skill that became useless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Damn old man!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid felt manipulated as he landed on the ground after Neberius.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Neberius had already finished completing a new spell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dark Storm.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the moment when the magic that Yura used to kill Grid and Doran, as well as shatter the Yatan Temple, was triggered.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Flinch.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid wanted to shrink back from the trauma but he instead swapped to the Divine Shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* There is a high chance of completely resisting dark spells.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an option present for both the legendary Divine Shield and the Holy Light Armor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This overlapping effect was the antithesis of dark magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Haha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Neberius thought it was so absurd that he laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This person was directly hit by Dark Storm, but he wasn’t affected at all? Instead, he was rushing forward.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Peng peng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">He tried to fire magic spells but Grid couldn’t be stopped.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The performance of the Divine Shield in front of him was better than any Divine Shield Neberius had ever seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What great craftsman produced it...? I can’t help feeling admiration. But it won’t do anything against these magic spells.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Neberius concentrated his magic power on the orb he had been holding in his hand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">An orb was a magician’s weapon and insurance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The orb could store magic that needed long casting time, and the magic would be immediately used when magic power was injected.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Neberius currently had two spells stored in the orb.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were the strongest spells that mixed three attributes, just like Dark Fire Storm that offset Grid’s Transcended Link.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What would happen if he trigger two of his best magic spells with no time difference?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Victory!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Neberius was sure of it as Grid emerged from the black storm.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had put away the shield and was holding the greatsword with both hands?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Stupid!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Neberius smiled with satisfaction and poured magic power into his orb.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Dark Thunder Explosion!]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a strong explosion that blended darkness and thunder in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Neberius could summon powerful magic again straight after Dark Storm?&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was Grid’s first battle with a magician who knew how to use an orb properly, so he received huge damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 14,300 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was this much damage, even with the Holy Light Armor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was surprised but didn’t shrink back.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was determined not to miss the gap where Neberius would be exhausted by the aftermath of the powerful magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Neberius still had one spell stored in his orb.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dark Stone Blizzard!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Again?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sharp stones and ice fragments were created around the confused Grid, stirring around him like a blender.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ahh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Tzedakah Guild members, who had been relying on Grid to defeat Neberius, sighed in unison.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In addition to them, everyone around the world watching the battle through TV or the Internet was thinking the same thing when Grid was hit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was an explosion of comments in the chat windows of the Internet relay rooms.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-Whatㅋㅋㅋㅋ A legendary class ㄹㅇ How funny ㅋㅋ It’s over now ㅋㅋㅋ.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">What type of legendary class doesn’t think about the magic stored in orbs?</span></i> <i><span style="">Why did he release the shield ㅉㅉ Really, this legendary class is more like a dog.</span></i> <i><span style="">He can’t fight.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Is his judgment blurred?</span></i> <i><span style="">Perhaps he is exhausted by Neberius’ Reverse Gravity?</span></i> <i><span style="">He seems to have lost his composure because his skills keep being neutralized </span></i><span style="">ㅇㅇ.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">That’s right.</span></i> <i><span style="">Frankly, the old man is fighting so well that he is bound to become upset.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">A good fighter...</span></i> <i><span style="">The basics...</span></i> <i><span style="">Honestly, even the top 10 rankers would have a hard time against the old man.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">That is a dog </span></i><span style="">ㅋ</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-No, haven’t you seen the news?</span></i> <i><span style="">In the first place, Pagma’s Descendant is a blacksmith rather than a combatant.</span></i> <i><span style="">It is fundamentally weak.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Did you see the dreadful power of those three skills?</span></i> <i><span style="">Pagma's Descendant isn’t weak.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Pagma might be a simple blacksmith, but he had the best swordsmanship after Sword Saint Muller.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I had a lot of expectations for the first legendary class ~~ But this...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It’s just trash </span></i><span style="">ㅋㅋㅋㅋ</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Ah...</span></i> <i><span style="">I didn’t think the fight would end so quickly...</span></i> <i><span style="">I just ordered chicken.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Hundreds of millions of people were disappointed or laughing in real time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had yet to notice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The fact that it wasn’t just pieces of stone and ice raging around Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kakakang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kwaaaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is crazy!’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Neberius was dumbfounded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the midst of the storm, two golden discs had suddenly appeared and were defending against the stones and ice?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The duration of the magic ended.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Originally, the hat wearing person should be torn to pieces. However, he was in a relatively good condition.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is a headache despite having lower combat power than the pope... Well, do you still have more to show?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The two golden discs spun around Grid who floated in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Neberius cried out to him,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“What is this? What is the nature of those great artifacts?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The armor, shield and the golden discs, they were treasures that not even the king of a country would have.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I would’ve won this fight long ago if it wasn’t for those artifacts...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid approached Neberius like a ghost. He spoke as he raised Failure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Don’t worry about it. It is my job to be overgeared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh! Diamond Shield! Dark Shield!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Neberius had used all the magic stored in the orb. His magic power was almost depleted, so he couldn’t use powerful magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Neberius strained himself using two unique defense spells at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then he started the chant for Teleport.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He only thought about running away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is the last hurrah.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The cooldown time of his powerful skills like Transcended Link, Link and Kill stilled remained.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Could he break through the double shields and stop Neberius from escaping?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Of course it was possible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The power of skills? He didn’t care about such things.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have the power of items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s Failure fell towards the two layered shield</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Holy Light Gloves option effect is activated, causing you to attack the target five times.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjeejeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Heok? What the...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Neberius’s eyes widened as he chanted the spell for Teleport.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The opponent dealt such a strong blow that the shields couldn’t fully absorb the damage and cracked?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[Failure’s option effect is activated, causing you to attack the target five times.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Heeook!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The two layered shield shattered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were hundreds of reflections of Neberius on the shattered remnants of the shields that scattered like glass fragments.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Fear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Neberius had lived for 123 years and he was filled with an emotion that he only felt a few times.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the predator of the sea swallowed him without any mercy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Failure’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘Bisect’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Bisect]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Deals 800% of your attack power to a single target. Some of the target’s body must be cut in order to induce various abnormal status conditions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 5 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuaaaack!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Due to his instinct to live, Neberius instinctively raised his right arm and screamed as it was cut off.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Neberius became more frightened as he saw the blood spurting out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That’s nonsense...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was aware that the Tzedakah Guild had more strength than he thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He felt tension from the assassin and young boy, while Balak’s feet were being tied up by a half human and an archer. There was the martial artist who took on 70 strengthened elders on his own.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But the hat wearing man who appeared last was special. He was too strong.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Despite being a trivial being -user- Neberius was reminded of Yura, who had been selected by God Yatan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That white armor and divine shield that contained enormous divine power, was he someone related to the Rebecca Church?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I heard that there is a secret temple in Rebecca’s Church that is fostering Rebecca’s Daughters and assassins... Did you come from that temple?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid replied to Neberius’s absurd question,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Temple? No, I am overgeared.” (TL: this pun doesn’t really translate well. Basically Temple and Overgeared sound similar in Korean.)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Overgeared?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The answer that wasn’t really an answer made Neberius’ confusion worse.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he felt terrible pain.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The blue greatsword pierced his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“K... Kuock...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the moment when the Fourth Servant of the Yatan Church was defeated by one user.</span></p>
