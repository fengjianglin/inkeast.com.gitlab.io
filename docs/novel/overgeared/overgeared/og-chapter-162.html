 <p><span style="">Chapter 162</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The whole process of the National Competition was possible to do inside Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But the Korean government invited the players to South Korea for the purpose of attracting tourists and decided to take some events offline, including the opening ceremony. The result was a great success.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Since the number of foreign tourists visiting Korea was close to 800,000, the economic effect created was expected to exceed the estimates of the Korean government.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Thanks to this, the authority of the S.A. Group has risen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were already many countries asking to be selected as the next host for the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The S.A. Group executives confirmed that the share prices had skyrocketed and made a toast.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It is a win-win.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The South Korean government was able to host the National Competition with the support of the S.A. Group, and they achieved high economic growth and gained overwhelming support from the public.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The S.A. Group’s stock prices rose and they could show an overwhelming influence. According to their policy of ‘returning 3.6% of the profits to society,’ the size of their charity businesses could be expanded and the number of poor people who benefited increased.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rankers received an astronomical amount of money in exchange for visiting Korea, and billions of people around the world were provided with great entertainment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was ideal for everyone, so it was understandable why they were laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Satisfy was satisfying the world, like Lim Cheolho intended when he named it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I feel rewarded.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Just like the gods created a world where everyone could be happy, the scientist was creating a world where everyone could be happy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lim Cheolho created a virtual reality world with no limits.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He reached the point where he would leave his name in history as a transcendent scientist.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Cheongdamdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"There really are a lot of beautiful ladies. Their slim bodies are to my taste.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon was feeling very good.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to this National Competition, he got a chance to play PvP with top ranking players, got a lot of money, and was also exposed to Oriental beauties. It was the feeling of walking on clouds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Girl, would you like to have a drink with me? I’ll buy you expensive liquor, so spend some time with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon was just as handsome as he was in Satisfy, so he was confident as he weaved through the streets. Despite his cheesy words in awkward English, he easily caught women.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka was sitting at a cafe terrace and was startled at the sight of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is that Pon?’ In L.T.S and Satisfy, Pon had never shown any interest in the opposite sex. Except when he was childishly fighting with Vantner, he was an exemplary person who only focused on fighting and levelling up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka was embarrassed by his completely different personality in reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’ve known him for over three years already, but I didn’t realize he was a guy like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas smiled at her from where he was sitting beside her and enjoying a parfait,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“He’s so busy in Satisfy that he doesn’t have time for anything else, but he can relax as much as he wants in reality. There are quite a few rankers who are experiencing such a phenomenon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"A plausible logic... Huh?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka nodded and belatedly saw what Regas was wearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What are you? Since when have you been wearing Taekwondo clothing?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I was wearing it since coming to South Korea? Jishuka, what? Why aren’t you aware of the attire of a person who has been with you for hours? What are you thinking about that made you so preoccupied?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka hissed at him without answering.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Change your clothes. It’s fine when the three of us are together, but your clothes are very eye catching.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Buzz buzz.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">In fact, there were countless people crowded around Jishuka and Regas.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The crowd wanted to get autographs and photos from both of them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But would Satisfy’s top rankers, who made enough money to represent a single company, go without guards?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The two people were able to enjoy themselves without worrying about the crowd due to being attended by 10 security guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If I don’t wear Taekwondo clothing in a Taekwondo country, what should I wear?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka was shocked by Regas words and don’t bother trying to persuade him anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, yes, do your own thing and eat the parfait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The way Jishuka saw it, there were two types of men.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Childish or wicked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid is childish and wicked...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Her first impression of Grid was the worst.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was stupid, stubborn, and only cared about big breasts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, he started to mentally mature at some point and that wickedness even left after marrying Irene. He was single-mindedly devoted to Irene and wasn’t swayed when he saw Jishuka’s big breasts anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was it because she witnessed the process of extreme change in real time?&nbsp;</span><span style="">One day, Jishuka’s eyes were chasing after Grid. After she was saved at a crucial moment in the Bairan battle, she became fully aware of Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the Grid she saw was just a picture in Satisfy. She didn’t know how he would look like in reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If I actually meet Grid... I’m afraid he will be like Pon.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Would she be disappointed?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Still, it was okay.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I’m in South Korea and have a chance to meet him. Yes, I've decided.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka stood up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The men shouted as her voluptuous body, hidden by the chair, was revealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I’m going back to the hotel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why all of a sudden? This is the first time you are in South Korea, so shouldn’t you go sightseeing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I can come back to South Korea at any time, right now I want to connect to Satisfy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That’s a good attitude.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Regas suddenly looked very motivated as he got up from his seat after Jishuka.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Every moment is essential. Okay! Let’s hunt and level up during our free time! In any case, both of us don’t have anything on the tournament schedule today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You can level up alone. I am going to connect to ask for Grid’s home address.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas questioned her,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Home address? Are you going to go there? Isn’t it possible to naturally meet Grid if our schedules overlap? Isn’t his ID on the list of participants? Why do you need to go visit his home? It’s bad manners.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid didn’t even participate in the opening ceremony. Maybe he won’t show up at all in this competition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka hurried away after saying this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'She is quite different from usual.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He didn’t know why.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Regas shrugged and followed behind her with the bodyguards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon was about to enter a store with five beauties when he noticed Jishuka and Regas.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Are they going to level up?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rankings could fall quickly if a person was careless.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wouldn’t his playing time shrink significantly in Korea?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pon’s vigilance awakened as he left the beauties and followed the two people.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pant... Pant... I’ve finally arrived.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He flew, drank potions, flew again, descended when his potion cooldown time wasn’t over, flew again and repeated until Grid reached Cork Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The good thing is that my persistence stat rose.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had flown for 46 hours without stopping, so his stamina had been exhausted several times. He had been tempted to rest a few times, but he didn’t want to miss Hell Gao’s spawning time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a hard journey that exceeded a triathlon, but he endured and was able to arrive at this place on time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I feel good.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">He felt a tremendous sense of accomplishment. It wasn’t a material gain, but the sense of accomplishment was comparable to making a high rated item.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘The sense of fullness I feel when I exceed my limits... Is this the reason why people climb mountains or do a marathon? I should climb the mountain in front of my house tomorrow.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid flew in the sky with a refreshed expression.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He looked over the island.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Good city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Cork Island was one quarter the size of Jeju Island.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t a small island and the climate was mild, so the city built in the center of the island was very developed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is a level similar to Bairan... The population of the island should be in the tens of thousands? Aren’t there a lot of useful hunting grounds and specialties?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid descended to the ground and entered the city. Thanks to the Hooded Zip Up, he didn’t need to check in and could naturally emerge in the crowd. Then he stopped at a restaurant just before Hell Gao’s dungeon in order to fill up his hunger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Turtle and whale meat? I’ve never tried it. Is it delicious?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The restaurant owner confidently gave Grid a recommendation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Of course it’s delicious. It is a delicacy to eat turtle and whale at the same time. You should try it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He asked NPCs questions and responded the way they wanted in order to build up affinity. The most efficient way to built up affinity with a merchant NPC was to buy a lot of their merchandise.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The warrior Grid didn’t know even these basics. He built up affinity by interacting with them for a long time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid now had a strong colleague called Huroi.&nbsp;</span><span style="">For the several months after the sylphid scales incident, he spent a lot of time with Huroi and learned how to build up affinity with NPCs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I believe in you and will try the turtle and whale meat. Please give me a plate of turtle and whale meat... Yes! Just give me the food that represents this island! Let’s eat double portions today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ohh, a broad-hearted young man! Okay, I understand! I will bring you well-cooked duck!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid liked grilled dishes, stir-fried dishes, fried foods and hot pot. But most of the food in the north of the Eternal Kingdom was steamed food, which didn’t fit Grid’s taste.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Since I’ve moved to the north, I haven’t felt the fun of eating food for a while...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The menu of the restaurant on Cork Island was mainly fried and grilled dishes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will eat until I’m satisfied!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid drooled as he waited for food. Then the owner brought out the food.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Due to Grid’s high stamina and persistence stats, his stomach was huge and he could eat a lot.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The restaurant owner’s eyes widened as he saw Grid emptying the food.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Eating enough food for three people at once... Great.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘In this case...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What would Huroi do now?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid thought before saying with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I’m not usually like this, but your excellent cooking made me overeat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Haha...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s high dignity gave a sense of oppression to the target, but it could also inspire liking in them. Wasn’t it natural for him to give off a charming and polite atmosphere?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The owner of the restaurant was instantly fascinated by Grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You look like a traveller, so why did you come to Cork Island?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have succeeded.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid responded to the owner’s curious and favorable eyes,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I came to see the monster who is the owner of hellfire. Can you tell me where the dungeon is located?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No, are you talking about Hell Gao?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">The restaurant owner was aghast.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"The dungeon he appears in is located in the north of the city... No, I can’t understand it. Why do you want to see him? Isn’t it an act of suicide?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is he that strong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The restaurant owner trembled and explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“He is the demon who ruled this island perfectly and fed on my ancestors. Legend has it that the number of people sacrificed to him was in the thousands... One day, Muller appeared and turned his body to ashes, but Hell Gao still occasionally pops up because his soul can’t be sealed. The residents are nervous every day that he will be completely resurrected and will turn this island into a living hell."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were too many ambiguous words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is this the precursor to a quest? Surely he isn’t going to ask me to seal Hell Gao’s soul that even Muller couldn’t seal?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was ridiculous.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The restaurant owner gave some advice to Grid, who was belatedly regretting it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The demon’s black flame is hotter than the jade flames of most demons, so you must be careful. If you go to ‘Ellen’ who lives on the south side of the city and say that I sent you, she will paint your armor with fire stone dyes... Before going to Hell Gao, I recommend that you meet Ellen Halmand to increase your fire resistance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Dyes made from fire stones?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was interested and immediately rose from his spot. He asked the restaurant owner in detail for the position of Ellen’s house and headed straight there.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Come in."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ellen was a kind person.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She heard his situation and gladly welcomed Grid. Then she pointed to the large basin in her backyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It isn’t that great, since it is a dye made from the fire stones. I just dip the fire stone in water mixed with my own recipe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohu...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The big basin contained one fire stone the size of a baby’s fist. But that one small fossil turned all the water in the basin red.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Ellen explained to Grid,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"It isn’t just a color change. Armors or clothes dyed with this will obtain increased fire resistance because they are tinted with fire.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid pulled out the Holy Light armor and gloves.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The material of the gloves are cloth, so they can be easily stained. But this armor is made of mithril, can it be dyed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ellen easily nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Fire stones are the symbol of fusion... They can mix with anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As expected of a rare mineral used in magic items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘My status immunity means I can’t be burned, but this can prevent additional damage caused by the fire itself. Braham’s Boots are black so the red color will match well with it... Good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid politely asked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Can you please dye this armor and gloves?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ellen easily nodded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I understand. I will dye it well if you pay me 500 gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid thought that Ellen was a hidden NPC.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He believed it was an opportunity to get free benefits because of his affinity with the restaurant owner.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yet she was asking for money?&nbsp;</span><span style="">As Grid was feeling confused, other users started to arrive at Ellen’s house.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Are you Grandmother Ellen? I heard about you from the grandmother at the grocery store.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I heard about you from the blacksmith. You can increase my fire resistance?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid looked at this and quickly realized.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The tip that the restaurant owner gave me wasn’t special.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ellen wasn’t a hidden NPC. She was a mere trader, and the Cork Island residents were skilled at soliciting customers for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The world is truly tough.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid pulled out 500 gold with trembling hands.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t bad to think of it as 500 gold to give extra options to two items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t know the numerical value of the additional options.</span></p>
