 <p><span style="">Chapter 252</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Sueron jumped with surprise.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rather than the farmer panicking...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Laughing?’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why was he acting so freely?&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘It can’t be!’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was a named NPC as well?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Stop!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Seuron sensed something and urgently shouted. But it was too late. Three vanguard members came close to the farmer and brandished their swords.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The ominous prediction was true.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwakakakang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A small sickle that was less than 40cm long.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The farmer blocked the attacks coming from three directions with a single swipe of the sickle.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He predicted where the opponent would attack and easily responded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Golden Guild members were baffled. It felt like their minds were being read.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The farmer pushed away the three swords that were in contact with the sickle. Then the owners of the swords had both arms thrown into the air, exposing a gap.&nbsp;</span><span style="">One farmer overwhelmed the strength of three people alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No, it wasn’t just that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was just a trick. He maximized his strength by exerting the enemies’ original strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Does this make sense?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Golden Guild members were confused.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The farmer’s palm... No, it felt like they were dancing on Buddha’s palm.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The farmer attacked them.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The sickle precisely entered the gaps in their armor and injured the Golden Guild members. However, it didn’t cause any fatal damage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The attack power was minuscule compared to Piaro, who was furiously killing the enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This isn’t a match for my skills.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel complained and abandoned his sickle. Then he pulled out a silver sword and cut the necks of the Golden Guild members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the moment when Kraugel showed no mercy to his enemies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The dying Golden Guild members felt resentment towards Seuron.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Calling him a hole...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Master, how is that a hole…? Damn...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Crazy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The three people lost their lives and Seuron cursed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t understand it at all.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What the hell was this area?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why were the farmers so strong?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was frustrating. It felt like this was Alice in Wonderland.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He lost his sense of reason and shouted curses.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“How rotten! What is this farmer? Does this mean soldiers can be dragon slayers? Dammit! Does this make sense?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What magic did that bastard Grid have to attract all these talented people? And why were they working as farmers?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t understand it, no matter how much he thought. He couldn’t make heads or tails of it. It felt like his heart was going to explode.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His eyes became bloodshot as the farmer suggested to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The damage will only increase if you send out your members. Isn’t it better for the master to go out directly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right. The three vanguard members were level 230. They were higher than the average level of the guild members. There would be a tremendous loss if he made his members face this man.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But how could he retreat?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t possible. Their enemy was in front of them. If the guild master showed his back, he would lose his dignity and sincerity.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Seuron had to go. He was confident that he could bring down that farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This farmer was definitely weaker than the monster Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Seuron responded to the suggestion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Come, I will kill you myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">First, he would strip the farmer of the straw hat. Then he would watch him die!&nbsp;</span><span style="">He took the souls of the dead guild member with Soul Exploitation, and summoned Soul Arrows.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Three soul arrows emanated a green light and were fired. It was a formidable speed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, it didn’t reach the speed of Jishuka’s arrows. It wasn’t at a level that could threaten Kraugel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kraugel moved his head to avoid the arrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sueron didn’t panic. Rather, he smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Soul Explosion!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The three soul arrows that passed by Kraugel exploded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the moment when a unique skill that inflicted damage in proportion to the caster’s attack power and magic power was activated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sueron anticipated that the farmer would be torn to rags.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the smoke from the explosion dispersed and the farmer only suffered minor damage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The farmer advised Seuron,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Your skill linkage is delayed. So it’s easy to react. Would you like to practice so you can link it faster?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Nonsense!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was impossible to speed up the linkage of skills. It was fast enough right now. And the timing was perfect. The other opponents normally died from this combo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘You are the strange one!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Seuron barely swallowed back the words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What are you trying to teach me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Seuron’s pride was wounded. He summoned a weapon from the inventory.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Brutal Heavy Sword]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the weapon he obtained after clearing Vasco’s labyrinth with his guild members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a legendary one-handed sword that increased the wearer’s strength and intelligence simultaneously.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was good since a Soul Predator’s skills were affected by both attack power and magic power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sueron wielded the sword firmly. Kraugel defended with White Fang.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Sparks flew as the two men’s weapons collided.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Chaeeeeeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The two people exchanged 13 blows on the ground and in the sky. Seuron’s cloak and Kraugel’s straw hat crossed several times as a brilliant battle was staged.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kraugel’s eyes shone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He is a good swordsman and his Sword Mastery level is high.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Soul Predator.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The skill tree seemed like a magician type, but it was closer to a magic swordsman type.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Seuron strengthened himself with Soul Transference.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The enhanced attack power increased Seuron’s momentum. The sword became much heavier than before.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Nevertheless, he couldn’t overwhelm Kraugel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kraugel taught himself how to handle steel. He moved like water and subdued Seuron.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eek!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Seuron became angry as the fight didn’t proceed the way he wanted. But it was a basic thing to not lose consciousness during a battle. He tried to be as calm as possible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was a conflict between reason and emotion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In that moment, reason barely triumphed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Seuron’s sword regained its tranquility.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will win! Soul Plundering!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Soul Plundering]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Takes away some of the soul of the living target. The opponent who lost a part of their soul will find their body hard to control for a certain period of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A good skill.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel admired it as the heavy sword struck his shoulder. It was originally a blow to the heart, but Kraugel minimized the damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Moving without a soul!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The farmer felt stronger the more Seuron thought about it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Seuron started to shake.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I thought I was stronger...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Soul Predator was a combat specialized class that had a variety of useful combat skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel and Agnus weren’t involved in external activities, so they were excluded. However, if he was compared to the current Overgeared members and Grid, Seuron was convinced that he was the strongest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But now he realized he still had a long way to go. An NPC was grabbing at his ankles.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Maybe he was weaker than he thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I need to focus on levelling up for a while.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sueron decided, while Kraugel became more thrilled after seeing his injury.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is more than rumored.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel highly appreciated the Soul Predator class and Seuron’s swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was enough to say that Seuron was one of the strongest among the users he met.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Fun.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Originally, Kraugel wasn’t interested in PvP.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His only concerns were adventuring, hunting, and raids.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But living with Piaro changed this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was fun to battle the strong. PvP had a different flavor from raids. This process was clearly connected with becoming a sword saint.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Next year, it might be good to participate in the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kukukuk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Seuron looked at the farmer who seemed crazy because he started laughing at his blood.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kraugel approached him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The sky above the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This title referred to the person with true talent who reached this infinite ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Moonrise Sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At this moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Seuron realized it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The farmer in front of him hadn’t used any skills until now!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Susuk.</span></i> <i><span style="">Sususuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Two moons were in the night sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kraugel activated the stealth function as he stood under the moonlight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Seuron had to concentrate in order to not miss the disappearing Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But how could he detect Kraugel, when even Piaro couldn’t?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel completely faded away.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Seuron was frightened as he consumed the souls of five Snake Guild members and activated Soul Armor.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A transparent green armor was laid over Seuron’s armor. Seuron was prepared for the attack that he knew he would face.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjeejeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ku...heok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sueron received a strong pressure from an unseen place. He would’ve been dealt a fatal blow if it wasn’t for Soul Armor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He barely withstood the offensive and started sweating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘My Soul Armor was destroyed!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The damage that Soul Armor Lv. 2 could absorb was 17,300 damage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was destroyed with one blow and he was also damaged.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This monster!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Seuron was stumbling with agitation when a straw hat appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The eyes shining under the hat was enough to cause a chill to go down Seuron’s spine.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Mole Ascension.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">White light soared from the ground. Seuron was astonished but he couldn’t react.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Had he ever felt this helpless since becoming a Soul Predator?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Absolutely not. This was the first time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sh...it! You! Who the hell are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Seuron questioned Kraugel as he coughed up blood.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Kraugel was reminded of Piaro’s introduction and replied,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I am a farmer of Reidan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That term...!”&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was spoken like it was the same as a knight or magician.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“You can’t just be a farmer!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel nodded at Seuron’s question.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right. I am a farmer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was true. For the next two weeks, Kraugel was a farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was provided three meals a day and a snack, just like other farmers. Accommodation was provided because it was a short-term contract. However, there was no salary.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Dammit!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Seuron was tired of the joke and used 11 souls to activate Soul Prison in an attempt to restrain Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the strongest binding skill that could trap even a level 280 boss monster for 5 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Taste inevitable death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Seuron squeezed out all his mana and created 39 Soul Spears. Then he launched it towards the farmer. Once he linked Soul Explosion, the farmer was destined to be scattered to pieces.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"White Light Sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel’s White Light shone with an intense light. The light was glorious enough to eradicate the darkness for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was like a flash shot. Seuron couldn’t open his eyes at all. It was difficult to control the Soul Spears.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The 200 members of the Golden Guild tried to help Seuron, but they couldn’t move. They stopped in place.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hao and the Hades Guild members watching the battle were also forced to bow their heads.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Seuron was dead when the white light faded away and everyone opened their eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His heart was pierced by the farmer’s sword and he screamed as he turned into grey light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Run away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao’s judgment was quick.</span></p>
