 <p><span style="">Chapter 327</span></p>

 <p><i><span style="">Buzz buzz!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A disturbance occurred at the Young Ladies High School festival.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because hundreds of women fell down for unknown reasons.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The victims showed common symptoms of a red face and panting.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Fortunately, it was a temporary phenomenon and they recovered quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, the Young Ladies High School was obliged to discover the cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">They dispatched medical staff and guards to investigate, but weren’t able to achieve clear results.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The good news is that the victims aren’t offended by what they went through. They actually said they felt good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? But they suddenly collapsed? Why?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I can’t tell you why.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hmm, this is good. I thought they would be crying out for compensation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, thanks to this, the festival won’t have any problems.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"But it isn’t all good... What happened to cause this incident?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"All the affected women will have something in common. We’ll check it with the CCTVs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Young Ladies High School. They had CCTVs installed all over the grounds.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was confident to the square, so the students’ privacy was guaranteed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The staff and medical personnel who watched the recorded video were amazed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A mysterious man who covered his face with big sunglasses and a mask!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Whenever his long and thick fingers touched a woman, the woman fell down!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"He must be spreading a virus. Otherwise, the phenomenon can’t be explained.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"A special agent sent from the North!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hah, truly. How is that a virus? How ignorant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Uh, anyway, he needs to be arrested for the sake of maintaining public order...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don't call the police. It is just a pervert, and we don’t want to spoil the atmosphere by calling the police.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dozens of security guards were quickly dispatched.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was in order to secretly capture Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Youngwoo didn’t have to worry. He had a shield called Peak Sword!</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pant pant... Is it here?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The duo of Youngwoo and Peak Sword broke through the crowd.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They finally arrived in front of the haunted house.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Shit!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo gasped for breath.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He felt an uncomfortable pain from his ten fingers. It was the result of continuously using them. He had overworked himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Reality is different from the game.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the game, he was able to move his fingers all night to please Irene. But in reality, he only lasted 30 minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The difference between the game and reality was huge. Youngwoo sighed and called Sehee.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The phone is turned off, and the voicemail...]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee’s phone was turned off. Yerim’s phone was the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'She hasn’t checked the message yet.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo had urgently headed towards the Young Ladies High School for a reason.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t get in touch with either Sehee or Yerim. All the text messages from Yerim were around a few hours ago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It seemed they couldn’t check their phones because they were busy with the festival.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo was frustrated and nervous because he couldn’t warn them to be careful of Kim Doohyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'That’s why I came here to talk to them directly!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo had an extreme hatred of supernatural phenomenon. Honestly, ghosts were scary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the past, he had seen the ghosts of Khan’s ancestors in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But wasn’t the haunted house in front of him made by schoolgirls?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It would be at the level of charming.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo turned to stare at Peak Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A garlic smell was coming from Peak Sword after he ate two kimchi ice creams.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo ordered him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I'll enter and meet Sehee, so wait here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I want to go in and play.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Did we come here to play? Something might happen. What if those kids come out while I’m inside?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Um, yes! I understand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword reminded himself of his duties.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wasn’t he supposed to act as Youngwoo’s manager? It was right to perform this role instead of enjoying himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword nodded at the entrance to the haunted house. After paying the entrance fee of 9,000 won, Youngwoo entered the haunted house.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">And.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuaaaaaaah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo thought that his heart was going to stop.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the first time he screamed like this since he had been born.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because he encountered bizarre bloody dolls as soon as he entered the haunted house.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is bad.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo realized.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This haunted house wasn’t at the level of being charming.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The props inside and the dismal lighting maximized fear. The intermittent sound effects caused the heart to sink.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was proof that the level of special effects of the Young Ladies High School went beyond the ability of ordinary high schools. It was comparable to Hollywood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Go back now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo didn’t have the courage to go through the labyrinth alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He tried to go back, only to stop.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He came here for his sister’s sake, only to run away because he was scared?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a truly pathetic brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“How rotten...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo cursed and took a deep breath. He controlled his mind and headed through the labyrinth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was courageous compared to the past.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">A ghost stood at the end of the dark labyrinth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Yerim, dressed in a high exposure costume.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kyaaaack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Someone screamed from the entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘That customer won’t be able to reach here.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yerim sighed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The problem was that the haunted house was too realistic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Everyone who entered was too frightened and ran away, so it was boring for Yerim, who was located at the end of the labyrinth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There wasn’t a single customer who reached her, even two hours after opening the haunted house.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"There are too many scary things.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yerim licked her lips and looked at herself.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Indeed, she looked sexy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was unfortunate that Yerim couldn’t show this fascinating appearance towards anyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘’Well, I am satisfied as long as I can show my husband, Youngwoo.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yerim smiled cheerfully and turned on her phone. It was okay since there weren’t any customers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yerim’s eyes widened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was because there were a large number of missed calls and messages from Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hehe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Did he get her report about her sexy look?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yerim thought it was because of the photograph she sent him and checked the messages.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">What is with those clothes?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Is Sehee with you?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Why is your phone turned off? </span></i><span style="">―,.―</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-Hey, be careful of that guy called Kim Doohyun.</span></i> <i><span style="">That bastard might try tricks on you.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“He’s worried.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yerim’s white face flushed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The opposite sex was attracted to her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a normal routine for Yerim, but this was the first time she received attention from the person she liked. It was also her first experience with liking someone.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Dugun dugun.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Her heart beat faster.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-Shin Youngwoo, you don’t have to worry about me.</span></i> <i><span style="">I won’t cheat even if he is a world star </span></i><span style="">♥ a</span><i><span style="">nd Sehee is currently doing the Sati...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Yerim was carefully writing a reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I finally found you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">2 hours and 23 minutes after the opening of the haunted house.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The first guest arrived at the end of the labyrinth where Yerim was located.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yerim confirmed his appearance and her eyes curved as she smiled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an alluring smile that would even overwhelm adult women.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“So good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo was exhausted because he had to overcome many adversities.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was unable to cope with Yerim’s voice and his legs collapsed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yerim’s beauty and charm was comparable to Youngwoo’s dexterity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The compatibility of both would be fantastic.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The Young Ladies High School’s 2nd playground.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This playground was normally used for various athletic students, but now thousands of people were gathered there.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reason was that Satisfy’s fighting competition would shortly be held here.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Doohyun oppa is participating right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Announcer Lee Minjung as well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I came to see Saintess Ruby!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sehee! Sehee! Sehee!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Doohyun! Doohyun! Doohyun!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"M-Minjung! Minjung!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Principle Lee Cheongsun was competent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She found out about the popularity of Shin Sehee, Kim Dooyun and Lee Minjung and used them in the marketing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a result, the fighting competition was able to enjoy an exceptional boom.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lee Cheongsun felt thrilled as she watched the audience.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Meanwhile, Sehee was in the waiting room and looking at the list of participants.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were 16 participants.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were celebrities in every field.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Celebrities, athletes, the literary field, etc.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were people who would attract attention.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Young Ladies High School’s Satisfy tournaments were for goodwill and publicity, so the inclusion of celebrities was a basic premise.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Of course, the balance was a mess.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were level 40 beginners as well as users over level 200. But nobody cared about that. Winning or losing wasn’t important in this competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘My opponent is...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Go Jimyung.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the KBO league player. (TL: Baseball)&nbsp;</span><span style="">He once had the reputation of the best hitter in South Korea. However, since last year, he had entered a relationship with the leader of the girl group Farina and his score plummeted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He received a lot of criticism from his fans, but he was still fairly popular.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Okay.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Go Jimyung’s level in Satisfy was 187. It was the second highest level among the 16 participants.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sehee would naturally be defeated in a fight against Go Jimyung, but she didn’t mind.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the first place, she participated in the competition because of the school’s request.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They asked her to participate in Satisfy related events for the sake of the festival. As a student, Sehee couldn’t refuse. It was good for her to be eliminated quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She didn’t notice Go Jimyung sneakily looking at her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was very motivated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was his girlfriend Reina’s request.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Aren’t there are a lot of penalties when dying in the game? You must kill that girl called Sehee in this tournament.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I don’t know why, but I should listen to the request of my goddess.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Young Ladies High School’s fighting competition would be held in sparring mode.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Health would only fall to a minimum and the participants wouldn’t die.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But that wasn’t an obstacle.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If his opponent applied for sparring mode, he would decline and then kill her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Kukukuk.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Go Jimyung was seduced by a bad woman.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a result, his life was gradually on the verge of self-destruction.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I feel dirty for some reason.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At Yerim’s suggestion, Youngwoo was wearing a festival doll mask instead of sunglasses.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He arrived at the 2nd playground with Yerim and Peak Sword, and felt an instinctive displeasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is all due to Kim Doohyun.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo was horrified as he imagined the actor flirting with his sister at this moment.</span></p>
