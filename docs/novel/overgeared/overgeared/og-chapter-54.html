 <p><span style="">Chapter 54</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">No, it still wasn’t certain that he’d been discovered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Faker’s Stealth skill was at level 7.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even the top rankers would have trouble detecting him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker held his breath in order to maintain a more complete stealth state.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he couldn’t escape from Erina, no, Euphemina’s insight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Don’t peek at me like a pervert. If you don’t come out, I’ll make you come out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was Euphemina’s final warning.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Faker’s party members became agitated at the dangerous atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">(Hey Faker, don’t you think she really noticed?)&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">(It might be a mistake to keep hiding. Remove Stealth and reveal your identity.)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker replied angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">(Blacksmiths don’t have any detection techniques. No, even if such techniques existed, there is no possibility that my stealth would be discovered. Don’t worry about it. That woman is just making guesses...)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker’s conversation was interrupted.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A large explosion occurred in a radius of 3m around Euphemina’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker was in range so he rushed to escape the aftermath of the explosion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Euphemina had no intention of letting him go.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Angel’s Scream.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Biiiiiik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“....?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ultrasound waves rattled Faker’s eardrums.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Faker made a pained expression as his ears started bleeding. Then Euphemina stared blankly at him and asked,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Who are you? Why are you watching me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Who are you?’&nbsp;</span><span style="">That was what Faker wanted to ask.&nbsp;</span><span style="">How did a blacksmith use top-level magic in succession?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Perhaps?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker was confused. He needed confirmation.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Sususuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker’s body move slightly and left dozens of afterimages.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As Euphemina observed the scene, the hat she was wearing was peeled off by Faker.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Faker was surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The face of the blonde woman, revealed by the hat, was exactly the same as their portrait.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the ID above her head wasn’t Erina, but Euphemina.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘We were wrong from the beginning. All the information we gathered was false.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker came to this conclusion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were countless guilds who wanted to obtain the maker of the Special Jaffa Arrows. They were fiercely competing to avoid having the blacksmith stolen by other guilds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They would spread false information to disturb or trap the competing guilds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker gritted his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'We fell into a trap.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the worst case scenario, the item production game in Winston might be a false drama from the beginning.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If so, the Tzedakah Guild was dancing on someone’s palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Give it to me.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina took back her hat from the shocked Faker. Then she spoke in an angry voice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Why are you taking away my belonging instead of answering the question? This is annoying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker stared at her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"What guild do you belong to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a puzzling question from Euphemina’s standpoint.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I don’t understand what you are talking about. Rather, shouldn’t you answer? Why did you follow me for two days?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You must be joking... If so, I will use force to make you tell the truth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">To define it simply, the Tzedakah Guild was a group of leaders.&nbsp;</span><span style="">All of the guild members had aggressive tendencies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina also had a formidable temperament.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...All the men I meet these days are like psychos.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was a person to be protected, no matter how much she didn’t like it. However, Faker was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She wanted to get rid of him for the insult.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“First you watched me, now you are threatening me? I’ll have to fix that nasty head of yours. Lightning.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pachchik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Static electricity appeared around Faker.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At the same time, a lightning bolt fell from the clear sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker avoided the lightning at a fast speed, producing dozens of afterimages. Then he appeared behind Euphemina.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that moment, Euphemina’s hand touched Faker’s abdomen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Unfortunately for you, I won’t fall for the same technique twice.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker’s body was surrounded by flames.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Faker didn’t even scream.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t feel any pain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina attacked the wrong target. In other words, the Faker standing behind Euphemina was a clone, not the real body.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pakak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina was struck in the side by a kick and fell down with a groan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Faker looked down at her and explained,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"The same technique can be applied differently. It is certainly great that you can use magic without chanting, but you aren’t my opponent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">To be honest, Euphemina was nervous. It was the first time she had been hit in a battle against a user since becoming a Duplicator.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This man, he is strong.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He used top-level assassin techniques and was good at fighting.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was an opponent to watch. But that was all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It is only a moment of elation. Ancient Queen’s Knight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An intense light flashed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Faker recovered from his momentary loss of sight and was astonished.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A knight in black armor had appeared in the air in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Familiar...?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was impossible for a magician to summon a familiar.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A summoner class existed in Satisfy. A familiar had to be called using a summoner’s authority.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-Kuaaaaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The Ancient Queen’s Knight grabbed a part of the darkness around its body and held it like a sword towards Faker.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The momentum was like a great mountain was going to hit him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Originally, assassins used secret weapons. There was no chance of winning a head on fight against a knight.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker narrowly avoided the attack from the knight. Due to this, the outer wall of a building was destroyed and dust scattered all over the place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker ignored the sharp piece of stone that scratched his cheek and ignored the knight. Then he threw three daggers towards the worried Euphemina.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The dagger flew at a speed that couldn’t be avoided by a magician.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t useless even if she tried to defend with magic. Faker had tossed a dagger that had a hidden ability to explode in response to magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'That's it!'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker thought he won, but then something unexpected happened.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Sususuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina observed the three flying daggers, then her body moved slightly, creating afterimages and avoiding all the daggers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Unbelievable! After a familiar, is it an assassin’s skill?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Originally, it required extreme concentration to figure out which of the dozens of afterimages was the main body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Faker couldn’t concentrate because the Ancient Queen’s Knight was constantly attacking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker’s watching party members were forced to interfere.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We’re going to help!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Are you still insisting on a one-on-one fight? Don't make me laugh! Don’t ignore us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It can’t be helped. She isn’t an opponent you can win against! Do you think we’ll leave you alone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hiyah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker’s party members were part of the Tzedakah Guild and also in the top rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the four of them couldn’t overpower Euphemina.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Over the past month, Euphemina had duplicated the techniques of rankers while searching for an orb production method, so she was currently in her strongest mode.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dragon Claws.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">While the Ancient Queen’s Knight tied up Faker’s feet, large and sharp stone pillars rose in succession from the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Faker was forced to rush in every direction to defend himself, while a rain of fire poured down from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"She is using great spells in succession?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No way...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The faces of Faker and the party members filled with despair.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They got a glimpse of Euphemina’s true power.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka’s face distorted as she arrived at the collapsed scene in the middle of the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Someone dares touch our guild?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Before Satisfy was released, the Tzedakah Guild was the strongest armed group in L.T.S. that no one dared meet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even the giant guilds were wary of the Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka was determined to make Tzedakah the strongest guild in Satisfy. Indeed, they had already become a famous guild among the top rankers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But being well known was separate from being the strongest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In order to reign as the strongest, they couldn’t show even a hint of weakness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka commanded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Find her right now. We’ll show the dignity of the Tzedakah Guild by shattering her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The opponent was someone who defeated four guild members, including Faker.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">According to the testimony of the witnesses, she could use the skills of all types of classes. Her strength probably wasn’t normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Maybe she has an hidden class.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Jishuka wasn’t afraid. The true power of the Tzedakah Guild hadn’t been shown yet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thus, this was the beginning of the bad relationship between Euphemina and the Tzedakah Guild.</span></p>
