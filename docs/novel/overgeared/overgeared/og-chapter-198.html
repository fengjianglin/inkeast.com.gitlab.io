 <p><span style="">Chapter 198</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style=""> “Are you okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sniffle! Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Shortly after Sehee rescued the NPC boy.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kiyaaak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A soul doll sprang towards Sehee.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Danger!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yerim moved.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a reflexive action.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She just wanted to help a friend in crisis, so Yerim pushed Sehee and became the target of the soul doll instead.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She would’ve done the same thing even if this was reality.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sehee was her only friend, so she was as precious as family.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Anyway, the Satisfy system recognized her as a ‘hero who saved the Saintess.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Saintess is the symbol of wisdom and virtue.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[I applaud your courage for making a sacrifice on behalf of the unique Saintess who will benefit the world.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You can convert to the epic rated hidden class, Saintess’ Knight.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yerim became stunned as she checked the odd notification window that appeared in front of her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She faced the soul doll’s kick with her pretty face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A blue greatsword fell from the sky like a lightning bolt.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kyaak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a truly amazing sight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The soul dolls were armed with spectacular weapons and armor, so they couldn’t be defeated even when attacked in groups.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Who was the person who saved them by showing strength on another dimension?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee and Yerim gazed at the man who descended from the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had neat black hair with a crown on top of it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wore red and gold armor that matched with the black boots.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A cloak that emitted a bloody smell.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Seven golden blades revolved around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was a person who showed his absolute dignity in the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That person was Shin Youngwoo, Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oppa?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The two girls’ eyes fluttered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">How did he know to come to this place and save them?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The girls felt like it was destiny.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘As expected from Oppa.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He truly is my prince.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Come this way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid hid the girls behind his back and studied the situation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hundreds of golems were approaching.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were red from the blood of the slaughtered humans.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaduduk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid gritted his teeth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he had been even a little later, these damn bastards would’ve hurt his little sister and her friend.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Grid from a month ago would’ve rushed over to the golems straight away.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But since Lauel joined him, his prudence had doubled every day.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yesterday, he had a slip of the tongue with the Tzedakah Guild members, but that didn’t often happen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Euphemina, how many golems are there?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina observed Reinhardt from the sky and replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">There are 733 old golems, 187 soul dolls and 12 ancient weapons.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">As a Duplicator, Euphemina had high insight. It was higher than Grid, whose insight was currently close to 1,000.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to that, she could quickly and accurately identity the number of golems.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid nodded and measured the combat power of the golems.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The old golems have a combat power of 9,300, the soul dolls are 15,000 and the ancient weapons are 26,000...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The pope’s attack power was 24,000.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Even a difference of 100 was big when it came to combat power. Let’s assume that 1 was the power of an ant and 100 was the power of an eagle.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The ancient weapons had 2,000 more combat power than the pope, so they were hard to ignore.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There are 12 opponents more powerful than the pope...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Even the weakest of the old golems were stronger than the knights. Every soul doll was equivalent to a top ranker.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid couldn’t afford to take on these golems alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wasn’t ‘Fight the Golems’ a cooperative quest in the beginning?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid thought for a moment before shouting.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Summon Knights! Huroi! Lauel! Jude!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pak!</span></i> <i><span style="">Papat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the moment when the privilege of a noble was invoked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The called people appeared in a flash of light around Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid invited them and Euphemina to the party before saying.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Smash all these damn golems. First, I need to make a party with my sister.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Ruby has joined the party.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Sexy Schoolgirl has joined the party.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Sister?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They turned their gaze behind Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were surprised to see two beautiful girls wearing novice clothing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The party information window showed they were only level 1.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel asked,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Do you plan to be a bus?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bus.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a term used for high level users raising a low level user.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In Satisfy, it was impossible to hunt in a party with a 35 level difference, because the low level user wouldn’t gain any experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"A level 1 noble will be born.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, the rewards for a cooperative quest were shared equally among all party members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If Grid killed one golem, it was treated as all the party members killing one golem.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And the rewards for the ‘Fight the Golem quest were as followed:&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After defeating an old golem, 300 gold and 100 kingdom contribution would be acquired.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After defeating a soul doll, 1,000 gold and 500 kingdom contribution would be acquired.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After defeating an ancient weapon, 3,000 gold and 1,500 kingdom contribution would be acquired.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A user couldn’t become an earl, marquis or duke just through contribution points. However, a baron required 3,000 points and a viscount 10,000 points to be upgraded, regardless of the level.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In other words.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Thanks to Grid, Ruby and Sexy Schoolgirl can enjoy the game from level 1.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was this being born with a gold spoon?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No... It is diamond cutlery, not a gold spoon. No, it is adamantium.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Anyway, the world was unfair.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel became aware of this once again as Grid ordered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Jude, Ruby and Se...xy Schoolgirl...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was with this ID? Grid looked at Yerim incredulously.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yerim just laughed at him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid sighed before speaking again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Jude, protect Ruby and Sexy Schoolgirl. The rest will help me deal with the ancient weapons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The main reason for the NPC army and the users’ lack of strength was because magic attacks didn’t work on the golems.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In order to allow Euphemina and the other magicians to play an active role and to make the battlefield more favorable, they had to deal with the ancient weapons first.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Right? Lauel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You are wise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel complimented and Grid grasped the +9 Failure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The thrilled Huroi shouted,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“My Lord! You are a divine being and nobody can block your way! All results will be done according to your will!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your morale has increased.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your attack power and magic attack power will significantly rise for the next attack.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The next attack will be a critical hit!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A buff skill that was only possible for a second advancement orator was applied to Grid!&nbsp;</span><span style="">He smiled and called out the name of his skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship! Transcended Link!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The goal was the ancient weapon 200m ahead.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A total of 20 energy blades that inflicted 150% of his damage per hit flew towards it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The golem that didn’t allow one attack while advancing from the south of the Eternal Kingdom was hit.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuuuuong.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Transcended Link was a critical and caused the ancient weapon to fall to one knee. In the aftermath, the buildings in the area shook greatly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kik.</span></i> <i><span style="">Kikik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The ancient golem suffered damage that was more than two-thirds of its health and made a bizarre sound. Then the Anti-magic Shield was turned off.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina saw this and used magic from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Storm Gravity Field.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A gravitational field 5m in diameter was created around the fallen ancient weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">10 old golems and one soul doll in the vicinity were also sucked into the gravitational field.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then on top of that.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A huge storm struck from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Indecisive Mumud’s Orb’s option effect is activated, increasing magic damage by 100%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Magic damage has increased by 68%.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kiyaaaaaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The golems shrieked from inside the storm. Their bodies slowly disintegrated and stone powder was spread all over the place.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Lauel came out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Armed with Grid’s unique rated qi gun, Lauel proved why he was 1st on the qigong master rankings.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dragon’s Scream.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a neat finish.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The golems, trapped in the gravitation field, collapsed due to the damage and soon turned to grey light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have destroyed an ancient weapon.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[3,342,000 experience has been distributed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have destroyed a soul doll.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[87,300 experience has been distributed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have destroyed an old golem.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[24,550 experience has been distributed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Heok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Crazy..!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The golems had overwhelmed the hundreds of thousands of troops in Reinhardt with absolute strength. Yet they collapsed due to the combination of only four skills, so people were amazed beyond admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In particular, Happy, who was ranked 304th.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What type of monsters are they?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Everyone knew that Grid was strong.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But what about Huroi?&nbsp;</span><span style="">As the only non-combat class in the top 1,000 rankings, his strength was more than Happy imagined. Grid had obviously become twice as strong due to his fraudulent buff ability.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel was also more than rumored. His rapid growth seemed to be related to the huge qi gun on his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was also the person called Euphemina...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Who is she?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She was a completely unfamiliar person, but she was a powerful magician who seemed to have the strength of the 5th ranked Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Finally.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ruby. Sexy Schoolgirl. Jude will protect them.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The NPC was armed with the black sword that Grid used to defeat Bondre in the National Competition, and was overwhelming three old golems alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hiccup!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">People were so surprised that they couldn’t help hiccuping.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As hiccups were heard from all directions, Grid wasn’t feeling very impressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"These golems, why don’t they drop items?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...I’m not sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel didn’t know. He couldn’t always answer Grid’s questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Grid doesn’t just have outstanding ability as an individual. He also has strong knights. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 In particular, the user called Euphemina used S-grade magic without any casting time.. She must have a hidden class. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The conclusion is that we must praise God Grid. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The anchors and experts relaying the Reinhardt war situation praised Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The netizens were the same. It has been a long time since the National Competition, so they watched the exciting battle video and praised God Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The seeds of praising Grid were planted in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the same for Wiesbaden, king of the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh...! Who’s the brave person who is dealing out justice to the cruel golems? Goddess Rebecca heard our prayers and sent us a mighty warrior...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Steim proudly explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"He’s my son-in-law."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Steim cleared his throat and proudly stuck out his chest.</span></p>
