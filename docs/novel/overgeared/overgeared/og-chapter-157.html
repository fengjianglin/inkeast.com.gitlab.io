 <p><span style="">Chapter 157</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">It happened after he observed the 39th resident.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Insight has increased by 1.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid identified the fifth rise in his insight stat and smiled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The Character Observation skill of the Commander's Sword is better, but the Talent Search attached to the Ruler's Sword raises insight faster.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s deep eyes observed a young man engaging in repairing the wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Talent Search!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have discovered the target’s abilities, skills and potential.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Name: Ian</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Age: 27 &nbsp;&nbsp;Gender: Male</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Occupation: Miner</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level: 33</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Strength: 45/115 &nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 69/138&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Agility: 21/80 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligence: 48/81</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill: Pickaxe (C).&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A young miner in Bairan Village.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* A very ordinary person. You have failed to discover any hidden talents.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid realized it clearly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Jude... He is a really big idiot.'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had observed 40 residents and hadn’t found anyone with a lower intelligence than Jude. When it came to the maximum intelligence, the lowest he had seen was 80 points. He had never seen anyone with a maximum potential lower than 80.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘But Jude has a maximum intelligence of 20 and his current intelligence is 11...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jude was stupid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He’s easier to manage if he’s stupid, but it is still pathetic.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then a man with a solid body approached Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kyaaack~ spit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The man spat like it was a habit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His grey hair rose into the sky like he had been struck by lightning.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had a muscular body and sharp eyes like a beast.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Toon, who was ranked 35th on the unified rankings and had a rare hidden class.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He handed Dainsleif to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“No matter how I think about it, I can’t buy this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was puzzled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why? It might have a unique rating, but isn’t its performance comparable to a legendary rated weapon? The attack power might be slightly lower than a legendary weapon of the same level, but the options are better. 4 million gold is an appropriate value, so isn’t it better to buy this instead of something else?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toon made a sour expression,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I know how good it is. I want to have it. But I’m not rich enough to spend 4 million gold. Kyaaack~ spit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If you’re 35th in the unified rankings, aren’t you popular in your country? Shouldn’t you sweep in money by appearing on TV programs and CFs? Doesn’t every guild member make money like this? In particular, Jishuka gets a lot of money just from spending half a day taking photos for magazines.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...That is a story for someone else...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toon’s voice was weak. Grid couldn’t hear him properly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toon shouted loudly,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I don’t receive any broadcast or CF offers! I can only make money through hunting! But I can only earn 10,000 gold a week through hunting!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">For reference, 10,000 gold was worth 12 million won.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Toon earned 12 million won a week?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a huge sum for the general public, but it was different for a ranker.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the case of items with a usage level of 250 or higher, it was virtually impossible to buy good items at 10,000 gold a week, because the price of epic items was over 400,000 gold.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sooner or later, Toon would be unable to arm himself with the right item for his level. This meant he would have difficulty hunting and his ranking would fall.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I was a swordsman before I received the rare class, so I have Sword Mastery. However, I have been using wristblades for a long time, so I am most comfortable with them. If Dainsleif was a wristblade type weapon, I would buy it even if it means going into debt. But I’m not foolish enough to do that for a greatsword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Um... Okay, I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toon looked at Grid holding onto Dainsleif and asked,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"But why did you trust me and let me borrow your weapon? I could’ve run away with the weapon? You only met me once and even then I didn’t give a good impression... How could you lend such an expensive item to a guy like me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A chill went down Grid’s spine as he listened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I was stupid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura and the Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The rankers that Grid met directly were very rich.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had high recognition because they always appeared on TV, and they swept in money with media interviews, photo shoots and CFs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Therefore, Grid had the perception that rankers were rich and rich people wouldn’t steal equipment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Toon wasn’t rich like the other rankers. It wasn’t unusual if he tried to steal expensive items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘In the first place, there is no law that the rich won’t steal... I was too relaxed. There are so many things happening these days that I wasn’t alert.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was fortunate that Toon was a conscientious person, or Grid would’ve been robbed of 4 million gold.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid thought it was time to be more cautious. Then he started to like Toon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is commendable that he returned it instead of taking it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid said, “If you find a good production method and materials while hunting, bring it to me. I will make an item for you at a reasonable price.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Italian Toon was an orphan. Due to that, he lived a hard life and fell into the mafia.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was only in the organization for five months and was lucky that he didn’t commit murder. However, he did many bad things such as blackmail, drugs, and gun trafficking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But after seeing Satisfy, there was such joyful content that he could enjoy. Why should he damage other people by doing bad things? He wondered. Then he left the organization in return for his left eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Since then.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toon was talented in the game and became a ranker, but he couldn’t completely fix his temper and kept showing violent tendencies. So he clashed with other users and became notorious in Satisfy. He liked to fight, so he didn’t have any friends.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But things changed since entering the Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka perfectly curbed Toon’s violence and he could enjoy Satisfy relatively peacefully.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now at this moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the first time since Toon started playing Satisfy. No, it was the first time since he was born in this world that people did him a favor with no conditions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toon looked at Grid. Like everyone else, he thought Grid hated him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now he was showing Toon this favor?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He is a man with a heart like the sea.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid looked like a great figure to Toon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘In the first place, he isn’t a regular person. He has the first legendary class...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toon bowed to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“The other day, I treated you badly and trivialized your workplace. I sincerely apologize. And thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If you know, then act better in the future. First of all, stop spitting. I don’t want to see you look like a gangster.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, I will try to fix my habit.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Toon, who frowned every day, smiled widely for the first time in ages. But it was nice to see.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Then I’m going now! I need to work!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s eyes sparkled as he watched Toon moving away with light footsteps.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He is a simple guy, like Regas said. He’s acting like this over a small gift, and it will be a great help in the long run.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toon would bring the production method and materials, so Grid had nothing to lose.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He could acquire a new production method for free and increase his production skill experience. Then he would earn money in the name of a small ‘tip.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Toon could buy an item at a cheap price and Grid could gain many benefits. It also won Toon’s favor, so he killed two birds with one stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Huhut... Aren’t I really smart these days?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now Grid had the thinking power of an ordinary person!&nbsp;</span><span style="">He became satisfied with himself, not realizing he was only average.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The Neberius raid was broadcasted, so the existence of pavranium is revealed to the world...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had planned to participate in the pet marathon by pretending that the pavranium was Yura’s pet. However, it became known that the pavranium belonged to Pagma’s Descendant, so this was a setback in his plan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Should he cancel his plans for the pet marathon?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No, it isn’t necessary.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ssik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid smiled and headed towards the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh! Welcome Grid!”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Smith welcomed Grid from where he was was making weapons for the soldiers under the command of the administrator.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"You have saved Bairan Village. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the residents! You are a hero! Hero!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The word ‘hero’ was heard.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid felt pride at the line and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I’m not just a hero, but an almighty hero.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid raised his hand to Smith’s shoulder and used a skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Blacksmith’s Affection.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Blacksmith’s Affection]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If you have the maximum affinity with a NPC blacksmith, you can raise their skill level by 1~5 levels.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The blacksmith who received your teachings will be loyal to you for life and will share with you every time they learn new item production methods.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Smith’s Advanced Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship has reached level 4.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Smith was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He felt that his skill had risen dramatically with Grid’s touch.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He embraced Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Thank you! Thank you! I can achieve the best work of my life thanks to you, and now I have received enlightenment again! For you, I will even lick your ass!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Nonsense!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid managed to shake off Smith.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lick his ass?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It could be an expression stating that Smith would do anything, but Grid knew that Smith was gay. A gay person told him that, so he got goosebumps.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You still haven’t married yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Married? At this age...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Quickly get married and abandon your strange tastes. And let me borrow your facilities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“H-Huh? Strange tastes...? Yes, yes. Feel free to use them. I can give up the entire smithy to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid ignored Smith and stood in front of the furnace.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He pulled out the Legendary Blacksmith’s Hammer and started smelting the pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will change the form.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Currently, the pavranium was in the form of two small discs. The whole world associated the two golden discs with Pagma's Descendant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But that story would change if he transformed the shape of the golden discs.</span></p>
