 <p>Chapter 13</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">I only had 3 gold and 11 silver.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I had to make items and sell them to people in order to earn enough to use the carriage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Once I saved up enough money, I could buy some blue orichalcum ore and make ‘Failure.’ However, saving money was as hard as plucking the stars from the night skies.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment I set foot in the smithy,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The effect of mastering ‘Blacksmith’s &nbsp;Craftsmanship Skill’ is activated. Blacksmith NPCs with craftsmanship skill beyond the intermediate level will treat you in a friendly manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[’Pagma’s Descendant’ class effect is activated. Blacksmith NPCs with advanced level craftsmanship skills will recognize and worship you.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was a hidden feature?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It meant I could readily obtain the desired production methods from blacksmiths.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Pagma’s Descendant class, the most I experienced it, the more I liked it. At first, I disliked it because it was a production class. However, it truly was a legendary class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I joyfully entered the smithy and found a blacksmith sweating in front of a hearth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I want to make and sell the most profitable item with the greatest demand. What is that item? Please give me a recommendation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I smiled brightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I am Pagma’s Descendant, someone who has mastered the Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill. Feel appreciation towards me, worship me, and hand over the appropriate crafting method!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But the next development went against my expectations.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Instead of the worshipping, the blacksmith gazed at me with cold eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Bah, a kid wants to talk about this subject. I don’t want to talk to a rude and incompetent person like you, so get out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“......?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was an ordinary NPC’s attitude towards level 1 users.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He didn’t recognize me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An intermediate or advanced blacksmith would instantly recognize me, but the blacksmith here didn’t know me.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It meant that he was a low level blacksmith who hadn’t even reached the intermediate level.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Ah, you. I met a lousy person.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I wanted to go to another blacksmith, but this was the only smithy in the village.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I expected this to be easy due to the notification window, but it was in vain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I forgot how unlucky I was. Dammit.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It couldn’t be helped. I hurriedly changed my attitude and respectfully spoke to the blacksmith,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"You were so passionate about your work that I was afraid to disturb your concentration. Therefore, I wanted to quickly get to the point. Did I sound rude? If so, please forgive me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Huh, I see. You have learned strange manners.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The blacksmith looked at me with interest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I stood as politely as possible, like a man engaged in a service job.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I am Grid. I would like to learn how to make items."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The blacksmith snorted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Bah, do you think anyone can learn how to make items? A child like you should start from firewood. No, not even. If you sincerely want to learn how to make items from me, you should go to the backyard and obtain firewood. You should be thankful that I am letting you do this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...How expected from a lowly blacksmith.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh? Did you say something just now?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was the one feeling regret now. The only person I could depend on in this village was a lowly blacksmith. If I was kicked out from here without learning how to make items, I would have to save money while doing restaurant chores or working in the fields until I gathered enough for the carriage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I'll chop the firewood. How much do I need?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The blacksmith gave me an old axe and said,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"As much as you can.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Chop Firewood]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Difficulty: E</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Blacksmith Smith has given you an errand to chop firewood. If you can finish this task well, Smith will look upon you in a more favorable light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Conditions: 500 pieces of firewood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Reward: Affinity with Smith +10, experience +10, 20 bronze.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Failure: Affinity with Smith -10.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Wow, it’s a normal quest window this time.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After starting Ashur’s quest, I only received S-grade or SS-grade quests, so receiving a normal quest felt like my mind was cleansed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I need 20 experience until my next level up... If I complete this quest, my experience bar will fill up by half.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was no change in the amount of experience needed to level up from -3 or -1. The amount of experience needed for minus levels seemed to be 20 points. In other words, at the minus level, I could raise my level just by doing these miscellaneous quests.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘First of all, I need to escape from the minus level.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I thought positive thoughts and headed to the backyard with the axe. After checking the trees piled up on one side, I looked at the axe in my hand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an old axe. Could this old axe be used to chop firewood?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Rather, I’m worried that the axe will be shattered upon hitting the tree... He might be angry if I break his axe, so I have to be careful...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I decided to use the ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Appraisal’ skill on the old axe.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Appraisal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The blacksmith who becomes a legend that appraises items with an excellent discerning eye. If a hidden feature exists in the target item, it will be found.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Smith’s Old Axe]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Normal</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 6/6 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 4~7</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An axe that the blacksmith Smith has used since he was young. It was well made and is very old, but still cuts well. The durability is weak so there is a danger that it will be destroyed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 40&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[No hidden functions exist.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an ordinary axe, save for the fact that it was very old. I felt relief, rather than disappointment, that the item didn’t have a hidden function. I had gone through so many incidents lately that I missed ordinary things.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have grasped the materials that make up Smith’s Old Axe, the production method, and the intentions of its creator.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your understanding of Smith’s Old Axe is now at 100%. You can use Smith’s Old Axe perfectly.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have learned how to make an axe.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to his passive skill, he perfectly understood the item and new notification windows popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I got 100% understanding straight away.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It seemed that items with low ratings could reach the maximum understanding just by using Appraisal on them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Indeed, it would be funny if a legendary blacksmith looked at a normal axe and couldn’t understand its production method.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"There are no conditions of use, so I don’t think an increased understanding is useful. The advantage is that the axe production method is gained.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A penalty would occur if I equipped an item that I didn’t meet the conditions of. The ‘understanding’ of an item was just a skill that played a role in reducing the penalty.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Smith’s Old Axe was an item that didn’t have a usage penalty, so there were no advantages to the 100% understanding, except for the addition of the production method.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I didn’t feel much inspiration, but I placed the axe to one side and set up a log. I thought about spitting into my hands and rubbing them together, like the old man in historical dramas.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There is no need for physical power when chopping firewood. I just need to go along the grain.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was knowledge I picked up from somewhere, but I didn’t know exactly what it meant by following the grain. It was simply knowledge that couldn’t be applied.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, there was no need to worry. Couldn’t I just cut the piece of wood like I would cut a monster with my greatsword?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is like using swordsmanship on a tree.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I picked up the axe I had put aside. The moment I was about to chop the log...&nbsp;</span><span style="">A solid black line was drawn near the center of the log.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Strange.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I watched it for a moment before putting the axe down, watching the black line disappear like it was a lie.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I picked up the axe again. The black line soon reappeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It felt like the axe was telling me to hit the black line.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is the effect of 100% understanding.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a possible interpretation, but I couldn’t be sure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I avoided the black line and hit the middle of the log with the axe.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Beeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Although I struck down with all my might, the axe failed and stopped halfway through the log. Chopping it in one go had failed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A notification window popped up stating that the durability of the axe had decreased by one.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"T-This humiliation...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I couldn’t even chop firewood... I was useless here as well!&nbsp;</span><span style="">I felt frustrated as I barely managed to pull out the axe stuck in the log. Then I threw the half split piece of wood to the side and picked up a new log.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This time...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I gazed at the black line and swung the axe.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttaak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment the axe touched the solid line, a light sound was made and an exhilarating feeling &nbsp;could be felt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The log was split in half without any resistance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was forced to admire the effect of understanding the item, finally realizing the importance of understanding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is what it meant by handling the item perfectly. The benefit of increasing item understanding isn’t just reducing the penalties or learning how to make the item.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was an expression about treating items as another limb. If I raised a sword’s understanding to 100%, I could use that sword like it was my own limb.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Item understanding could be thought to have the same type of concept as Weapons Mastery.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If I raise the understanding of items I created to 100%...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Invincible!&nbsp;</span><span style="">I had played the game for over a year, but now there was the possibility of entering the rankings!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Okay, earn money quickly and pay off my debt! Then I will become a ranker with the power of items!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Once I became a ranker, I would receive a staggering amount of requests from various media. I could become a rich person just from the TV performance fees. It came with bonus popularity and fame.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No one could ignore me anymore and I would be able to gain the heart of my first love, Ahyoung!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My motivation shot upwards!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Haaaah!! Hat! Hat! Hap!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttaak!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttaak!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttaak!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttadadak~!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">I didn’t rest as I chopped firewood for two hours. I couldn’t stop because the feeling of success was so thrilling.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the pleasure only lasted for a while.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As my level was -3, my poor stamina quickly ran out my sense of hunger came quickly after.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I started getting tired at around the 150th piece of firewood, my breathing became arduous and pained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Should I take a break and rest?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No, I wouldn’t.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The three months I spent on Ashur’s quest was exceptionally painful and difficult, but I pressed on without giving up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I had experienced such a thing, so I couldn’t take a break while chopping firewood. This exhaustion was nothing compared to everything I experienced before.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This isn’t hard work. Don’t rest. Finish quickly and proceed to the next quest. I will level up and make money.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I grit my teeth and kept on chopping the firewood.</span></p>
