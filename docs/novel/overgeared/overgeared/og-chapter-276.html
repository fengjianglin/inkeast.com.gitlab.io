 <p><span style="">Chapter 276</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura was praised as one of the best beauties in the world.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her beauty transcended race and people’s tastes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was a hundred times more beautiful in reality than on TV or photos. It felt like they would go blind when they stared at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was so astounding that everyone was silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The director was entranced by Yura’s beauty and came forward.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was 45 years old.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He married his first love 20 years ago and hadn’t cheated once. But this was the first time he faced a crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hum hum! Hum!”&nbsp;</span><span style="">The director regained his senses. He cleared his throat and smiled brightly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“It is the most auspicious day for this station thanks to Yura-ssi’s presence. But why did you come here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I came to claim Youngwoo-ssi’s fee.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Youngwoo...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One man came to mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His real name was Shin Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The team members were agitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Did Grid give you permission to broadcast live?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What permission? We didn’t know it was Grid in the first place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Huh, you can be in big trouble if you aren’t careful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why is Yura coming forward for Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The rumor that she is close to Grid is true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Isn’t Grid together with Jishuka? Wasn’t there a scandal last time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There was also a scandal with Yura.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The men trembled. They really envied Grid. It was to the point where they wanted to cry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘In my next life, I must be born as Grid!’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They would hit the ground and wail with regret if they were born as Grid, but they didn’t know this fact.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let's go somewhere else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The director led Yura to his office.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The chief director’s office.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elegance flowed from Yura as she sat on the sofa. Even the way she held the cup of tea was reminiscent of a noble.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura sipped the tea before cutting to the chase.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Pay Youngwoo-ssi 30% of the ad revenue generated by this broadcast. Then Youngwoo-ssi will forget that it was broadcasted without his permission.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"30% of the ad revenue?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was absurd.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was enough to break down the broadcasting system.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This joke is too much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Currently, the best star in South Korea was Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even she wasn't given a proportion of the advertising revenue for a broadcast.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was a popular trend, but Yura’s demands were too unrealistic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will give 350 million won.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an amount that put him in the same class as Yura. This was more than necessary.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it didn’t come close to satisfying Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You know that you can be held seriously liable if you use the gameplay video of another person for commercial purposes without permission.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Many cruel things were shown on this broadcast, so the Communications Commission is likely to come down harshly on you. It will become bothersome. Excess greed is just a poison.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura was one of the wealthiest people in South Korea. She had the best lawyers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The director wasn’t ignorant of this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He thought carefully and replied,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I know that our position is disadvantageous. But 30% is too much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was estimated that the advertising revenue of this live broadcast would be close to 15 billion won. This was an industry record.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">But to hand over one-third of it to an individual?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was beyond common sense and he couldn’t make the decision alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“In the first place, we relayed without knowing that the man in the mask was Grid. There is no reason to believe that we intentionally exploited Grid. In addition, Grid didn’t directly reveal his face, so it doesn’t infringe on his image rights. Besides, the filming stage was a public event. We have the right to broadcast everything that happens in a public venue...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In fact, OGC Station’s position wasn’t disadvantageous.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the person holding the sword was Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Please handle it flexibly. If you show me your sincerity, I will coordinate my schedule with OGC. Who knows? Youngwoo-ssi might also like OGC because of this work.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t time to look at the immediate profit and loss.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid and Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wasn’t this an opportunity to build a relationship with the two top stars who represented South Korea?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he could plan a broadcast around them, OGC would be able to steadily generate profits like today.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will contact you after a meeting. If we’re to transfer the advertising revenue, we will need to draw up a few separate contracts that I hope you’ll review.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Okay, now the conversation is good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura smiled brightly at the director’s clever judgment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the director asked her a careful question as she rose from her seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“However... You recently disappeared from the rankings. Is it because you obtained a hidden class like everyone guessed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Maybe one day I will explain in an interview with OGC news.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oh my! If this is true... I’m happy just imagining it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A huge smile.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The director’s rising lips were unwilling to go down.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He escorted Yura out of the building.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Click.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura entered the limousine with a bright expression.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was very satisfied, because the negotiations proceeded more easily than she had expected.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It would’ve been different if this was a major broadcasting station.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Fortunately, the opponent was OGC. As a broadcaster that only dealt with the ‘games’ genre, they appreciated Grid’s value.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘Won’t Youngwoo-ssi be happy?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Demon Slayer was a class hostile to the Yatan Church and demonkin. Therefore, she had no choice but to build up a relationship with the Rebecca Church.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura was interested in the pope candidates for this reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">She watched OGC’s live broadcast of the speeches.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But what was this?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The broadcast’s main character changed to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura was worried when she watched the broadcast.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid still didn’t know about the broadcasting world and this could harm him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was concerned and immediately took action.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She visited OGC and made it so that Grid received a huge profit rather than a loss.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Her reasoning was simple: Yura wanted to look good to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As the former 5th ranked user, she was well aware of Overgeared’s importance and wished to join them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She needed a place to rely on until her level was restored.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A few private emotions were also mixed in. </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The Vatican.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Such a pathetic person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kamiyan might be inexperienced, but Fulito never thought he would be killed by a fist.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was the shame of the Red Knights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Fulito didn’t mourn Kamiyan’s death. Rather, he cursed Kamiyan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I’m in this embarrassing situation because of that jerk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After Piaro betrayed the empire.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The new Red Knights developed by Sword Duke Limit were reputed to be black-hearted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They sneered at the residents of the empire, calling anyone not part of the Red Knights weak.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In such a situation, a Red Knight was killed by a man’s bare fists?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The dignity of the Red Knights was shaken to its roots.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Fulito was obliged to prevent this situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Wait until the end of the event."&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid would be able to use weapons once the event was over.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“At that time, I will beat you up and regain the dignity of the Red Knights.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hoh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was good news for Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Fulito’s combat power couldn’t be measured. He was much stronger compared to Kamiyan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wasn’t someone that could be beaten just by relying on Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid hadn’t been sure how to deal with him, so it was good that Fulito was giving him a chance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The viewers cheered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Wow, Fulito of the Red Knights is a little scary.</span></i> <i><span style="">He gave Grid time to beat his colleague to death.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">His confidence is incredible.</span></i> <i><span style="">Is he a single number?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-No, single number knights have gold epaulettes on their shoulders.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Hrmm...</span></i> <i><span style="">Then he must be in the 10’s.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Even the 20th knight is several times stronger than the 30th knight.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The illegal gambling sites were booming with all types of speculations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Grid vs. Red Knight Fulito]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The gamblers started betting on who would win the match.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Surprisingly, many gamblers bet on Fulito’s victory.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had leisurely watched while Kamiyan was killed by Grid. Considering that he also gave Grid time to use weapons, Fulito must be much stronger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In any case, Fulito seemed certain that he was stronger than Grid, so the winner of the battle would naturally be Fulito.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It’s time for my chicken to come.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">My chicken arrived 5 minutes ago and I’ve already eaten two chicken legs.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Sigh...</span></i> <i><span style="">When will this start? I will drink a bottle of soju while waiting.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">There are many boring pope candidates.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-Ahㅋㅋㅋㅋ I just remembered that this broadcast was originally a speech event for the pope candidates ㅋㅋㅋㅋ</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">As Grid waited for the end of the event, OGC’s audience ratings surpassed 43%.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rumors that the confrontation between Grid and the Red Knight would be started soon began to spread.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Millions of foreign viewers flooded to the OGC web channel, almost paralyzing the server.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As the whole world was watching,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The pope candidate’s speech event has ended.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The weapons that have been disabled for safety are released.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The +9 Failure has been equipped.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The +8 Doppelganger’s Greatsword has been equipped. Only 50% of the weapon’s attack power will be applied due to the penalty.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid held the two greatswords in both hands.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The users were excited.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-Two sword style?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Is he a rookie?</span></i> <i><span style="">How can Two Sword Style be used with greatswords?</span></i> <i><span style="">Really stupid;;</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It should be very restrictive to swing two large weapons at the same time.</span></i> <i><span style="">His posture will easily crumble.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Aish, you should only use one greatsword while fighting.</span></i> <i><span style="">This is just to look cool.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The community of the gambling sites fell into chaos.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The gamblers who bet on Grid started complaining.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Ah, this sucks.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I stupidly believed in him.</span></i> <i><span style="">Hah...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I was mistaken when I thought he was better than before.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">The nightmare is starting again...</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-Does he know he’s being ridiculed?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid attacked Fulito without saying a single word.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">When the attack from the Doppelganger’s Greatsword was blocked...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Papat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Failure was swung.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unlike Kamiyan’s Keen Senses which was an active skill, Fulito’s movements were affected by a passive skill, so it was hard to hit him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Fulito avoided Grid’s counterattack and used a skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Light Sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The power of this skill was incomparable to what Kamiyan used before.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was obvious that Grid would take a lot of damage when defending, and the orbit was too exquisite to avoid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then what should Grid do?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The maturing Grid knew how to cope with this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Revolve.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A counterattack triggered at the perfect timing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The power of the skill also rose due to the Doppelganger’s Greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Blood spurted from Fulito’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Fulito was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was much stronger than when he defeated Kamiyan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was natural.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pagma’s Swordsmanship increased attack power, critical attack chance, and critical attack damage, as well as generating all types of passive skills. But this was only applied when a sword type weapon was equipped.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">When armed with a greatsword, Grid was strong enough to exceed the extent that Fulito had assumed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Wow, Two Sword Style really appeared.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Kyah~ truly God Grid.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">As always, the viewers’ switch in opinion was fast.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The people who were ignoring Grid just a minute ago were now praising him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Currently, OGC’s audience rating was 45%. Reaching 50% wasn’t a dream.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a record in the decades of Korean broadcasting.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was once again writing a new legend.</span></p>
