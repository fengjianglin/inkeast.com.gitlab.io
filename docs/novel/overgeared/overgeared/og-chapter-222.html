 <p><span style="">Chapter 222</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">One month in reality and three months in Satisfy time passed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the meantime, Reidan’s crops grew well. It was because the water channels discovered by Piaro provided nutrients to the land, and Grid’s equipment improved the soil quality.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The financial burden diminished, so they no longer needed to import food at high prices. In addition, vegetation started to grow, the yellow dust became weak, and the people became healthier.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The sight of the sick children improving brought tears to the people’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This is all thanks to Duke Grid."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah! That’s right!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The people had been suffering for the past 10 years and were about to starve to death, so Grid and the Overgeared members were like angels sent by Goddess Rebecca.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The people were absolutely obedient to Grid and the Overgeared members, who were their saviors.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were educated and trained as farmers, blacksmiths, architects, soldiers, etc.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a result, they were able to feel a sense of accomplishment from reviving the city with their own strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Reidan was full of vitality.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Have you been out on the streets lately? Voices praising My Lord are everywhere.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Really? I’ve been so busy that I don’t have time to go outside.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the past, Huroi had vowed to serve Grid to repay the favor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now it was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Huroi respected the maturing Grid and was loyal to him based on that.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m proud of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The ghost town on the verge of destruction had now become lively.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to the Overgeared members, the monsters didn’t threaten Reidan, and a small but powerful army was being trained by Jude.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan was nurturing young blacksmiths, and thanks to Rabbit, the overall speed of development of Reidan increased.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina showed her strength in many fields by duplicating monster taming, blacksmithing and architectural skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In particular, Jishuka played a huge role as ruler of Bairan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She and the other two Overgeared members trained the knights and soldiers, and continued hunting the frostlight orcs and raiding the Guardian of the Forest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to this, the guild’s warehouse was filled with various minerals and sylphid scales. Soon, all members of Overgeared were going to have an invisibility cloak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The person who brought together such excellent talents and strong personalities?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was none other than Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Huroi’s respect for Grid increased day by day.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There’s still a long way to go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid wasn’t satisfied with the present state.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because Reidan was still in a deficit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘We only have a smithy, barracks, and alchemy institute as facilities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The number of people wasn’t increasing. Taxes also couldn’t be raised.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even though he made five items a day, he couldn’t see any profit at all. So Grid was in a bad mood.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What would’ve happened if Grid sold the 450 items he made over the past three months to users instead of investing it in Reidan?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I would’ve earned at least 1.5 billion won, even if I have to pay taxes and take into account the price of the materials...'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Of the 450 items, not one legendary rated item was produced, but there were two unique rated items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he couldn’t sell them to users and used them for the facilities.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel encouraged the grumbling Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t dwell on the immediate damages. Thanks to the items you made, the efficiency of each work field has increased by several times, and will return to you as a bigger profit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I know."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now it was time for lunch.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Due to all the work, Grid ate at the smithy while discussing things with Huroi and Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, Khan was busy teaching the young blacksmiths.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel clicked his tongue.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Khan is growing stronger every day. As I look at his increased health, I sometimes wonder if Reidan’s desert sand really does improve longevity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That inspiration is innate. Which reminds me, has there been a steady increase in sales for the Longevity Remedy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, this month’s sales has reached 1,230 gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Still, it isn’t even a quarter of Rabbit’s pay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit received a 500 gold salary as a viscount, then another 5,300 gold as his administrator salary.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the ‘minimum’ value set by Rabbit himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even if he pledged his loyalty, he wouldn’t work for less than 5,300 gold a month.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that Reidan’s current deficit was due to Rabbit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“But we shouldn’t begrudge him. Sir Rabbit’s value can’t be converted to money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to Rabbit, Reidan was growing quickly. The increase of domestic affairs was unrivaled when compared to other cities.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Indeed, a named NPC like Rabbit with an S-grade administrative skill was worth any price.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Don’t fret and look to the future.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After Reidan developed, the giant worms would be destroyed and the western area would be restored. Then he would use the western area as the foundation for becoming king.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was one of his immediate goals.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Then I will make money.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid would become a tycoon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t want to suffer again because he didn’t have money.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid ate the food that had been grown in three months, the rainbow potato.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He hadn’t been able to hunt for the past three months, so his level was stuck at 275, but he wasn’t nervous because his stats increased every time he made an item higher than the epic rating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was a blacksmith, so he could level up his stats even if he worked in the smithy.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The Butin Barony was at the eastern end of the Saharan Empire.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a rural area, with only the natural view of the sea.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Furthermore, it was a very peaceful place where monsters didn’t pop up, so it was extremely rare for users to come here.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, the 3rd ranking merchant, Muto, operated a small company and was extremely focused on trading with the Butin Barony.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Butin Barony might be empty of users, but it was a resort for rich NPCs and nobles.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The Longevity Remedy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Muto was focused on supplying luxury goods to the rich and nobles who visited the Butin Barony.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His sales rate had decreased suddenly, and he finally identified the reason.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He looked at the small amount of sand in the glass bottle and frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This sand is sold as a luxury product under the name Longevity Remedy? The selling rate of my products is falling because of this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Muto had seen countless items. As a merchant, his insight was excellent, so it wasn’t difficult for him to see that the Longevity Remedy was just simple sand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It’s a really good idea.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Which merchant came up with the idea of marketing the sand of Reidan as the Longevity Remedy?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Muto marveled after hearing about it from the NPCs of the Butin Barony.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This level of business acumen is almost at the level of a scam."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There must be a tremendous merchant hiding in Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Muto was sure of it. He worried about how he could compete with such a huge merchant and soon came up with an idea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Isn’t there a huge desert surrounding Reidan?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ssik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Muto smiled with satisfaction and immediately led his company to Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he faced difficulties as soon as he crossed the border.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"W-What is this?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The guards of the Muto Company were over level 200. As mercenaries hired at an expensive price, they perfectly protected the company from monsters and bandits.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But as soon as they entered the territory of Reidan, the giant worms, desert toads and other powerful monsters devoured the guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“T-This is crazy...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why were the monsters so strong?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The twin ogres were the strongest monsters he had seen so far, and they were nothing against the western monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“R-Run away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Muto Company had to run away from the crazy monsters.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Muto still didn’t forget to put the sand from the desert into his bag.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pant pant! Damn! I almost got killed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Muto trembled as he barely survived and returned to the Butin Barony.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was desperate, since he lost half of the guards in the desert.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I have to sell all of the sand to recoup some of the losses.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Muto went to find a merchant NPC. Then he brought out the Longevity Remedy he made from the sands of Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the NPC clicked his tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The Longevity Remedy is made from sand collected in the center of Reidan, not ordinary sand from the desert. We only acknowledge the sand from Reidan’s lord as the Longevity Remedy, while everything else is rubbish. Let’s stop any transactions in the future. I no longer want to work with a crook like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was bad.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He thought it would be easy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But his opponent had already penetrated into his brain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Muto was frustrated after losing many guards and clients because of mere sand.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">"Garlic.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Shin Youngwoo logged out of Satisfy and went out into the living room for dinner. Then he found his parents peeling garlic and sat down beside them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I’ll help you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo’s parents ran a vegetable store, and garlic was treated as a commodity. They had to work hard everyday to peel the garlic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the past, he didn’t help his parents, but now he was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He matured and was willing to help his parents.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But his parents refused.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Youngwoo, aren’t you having a hard time playing the game? You should take this time to rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes. This is our job. Youngwoo, you should go eat and focus on the game again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His parents dismissed the game in the past, but now they recognized it as his workplace.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo felt a sense of gratitude and sat down with a bright smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I want to help.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t easy for a person with less experience to peel garlic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The surface of garlic was hard and the skin was very thin. It needed some tricks to peel the skin attached to the surface.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo had no dexterity since he was a child. Until he joined the army, he couldn’t even tie his shoelaces properly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It normally took Youngwoo a long time to peel one garlic, so he wouldn’t be a big help.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo’s parents knew this fact, but they didn’t stop him, since their son said he was willing to help.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then after a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oh my? Youngwoo, when did your dexterity become so good?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His mother was full of admiration.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo quickly peeled the skin of the garlic like a pro. The speed was comparable to his parents, who had been running a vegetable store for decades.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His father was also surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What’s this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo was even more amazed than his parents.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Unbelievable. Why is it so much easier to peel garlic?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He felt like his dexterity had increased dramatically, unlike the past.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What was the reason?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo pondered over it as he peeled the garlic. Then he got the answer within minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'It is the result of repetitive actions!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A delicate hand was needed to make items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Since becoming Pagma’s Descendant, Youngwoo had made thousands of items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It seemed that his dexterity in reality increased through his memories and this experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I’ve seen it in the news before.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A person repeatedly practiced swordsmanship Satisfy, and their skills increased in reality.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the inevitable result of repetitive practice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Of course, a person’s physical ability in reality was significant lower than it was in Satisfy, so it was impossible to implement all the techniques. However, following some techniques wasn’t difficult.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the same reason why Youngwoo’s dexterity rose now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huhuhu...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo laughed with satisfaction.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was glad that if he ever obtained a lover in reality, he would be able to make her happy with his dexterity.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the moment when the legendary hand dexterity that brought ecstasy to women in Satisfy appeared in reality.</span></p>
