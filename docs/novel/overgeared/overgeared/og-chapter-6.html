 <p><span style="">Chapter 6</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The black magicians are the problem right now...’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was currently level -1, and my strength and stamina stats were only one point each. Mengel's Plate Armour added five strength, for a total of six strength. </span><span style="">When all of these stats were added up together, I totalled a measly 34 health. I might be able to punch a few of them before going to the netherworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Can I get away?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The failure of the quest was fixed anyway. I just wanted to preserve my life.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, I had to survive. If someone died two times in a day, they wouldn’t be able to access the game for 12 hours.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Okay, this was the only way!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Log out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You can’t log out of the game here.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Fuck! I should’ve expected this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was common knowledge that it was impossible to end the game while a timed quest was underway. There was a way to force it, but I didn’t want to use it since I would get a huge penalty.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After failing to log out, I looked for a way to escape. However, this was the stronghold of the enemy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was being surrounded by a rapidly increasing number of followers. No matter how many calculations I made, there was just no way to escape. There was no hope when I was a slow as a tortoise.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Break through to the basement at once!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As I was planning out my actions, Doran shouted at me before pulling out two daggers and throwing them without delay. The hand gestures were so fast that it happened in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One of the daggers struck a person’s eye while the other pierced another’s heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Doran narrowed the distance towards the pained believers and wielded his dagger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Open up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The believers couldn’t even scream as their necks were sliced and they vanished into a flash of grey light.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I couldn’t resist admiring it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The lack of information meant I didn’t know the exact levels of the Yatan believers, but temple NPCs were generally at least level 150+.&nbsp;</span><span style="">These believers were likely to be the same.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doran handled them so easily that I couldn’t even imagine his level.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is he perhaps a named NPC?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My impression of Doran changed. Maybe I could clear this absurd quest if I depended on him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">3,000 gold! A huge 3,600,000 won was in front of me!&nbsp;</span><span style="">The earl’s son-in-law! I imagined getting my hands on all stats +20 and a beautiful wife!&nbsp;</span><span style="">I would become a lord with my own territory, where I could steal high taxes from the users and NPCs!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If I become a landlord, I will be able to get revenue every month.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Exciting!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I began to cheer Doran on.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Good! Doran, fighting! I have admired you for a long time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh? For a long time? When have you ever seen...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah! Danger! Over there! You must take care of your body!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"B-Body...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">While Doran was surprised by my sudden change in attitude, he focused on dealing with the enemies in front of him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grey lights appeared in succession.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Really strong!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doran skillfully threw numerous hidden weapons as if they were merely extensions of his limbs.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The number one person on the assassin ranking, ‘Old Sword Demon’, that I saw on a broadcast two months ago, was like a young child next to Doran.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Isn’t he three times stronger than Ashur? I must befriend him and ask him to assassinate Ashur!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Yatan believers ignored me and attacked the threat, Doran.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But their efforts couldn’t stop Doran’s advance. Doran focused solely on those who were chanting spells, attacking them to stop their magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The black magicians couldn’t cast their magic, making them no threat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Amazing! You are really amazing! Doran, you are my god!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I heard a magic spell being recited and cheered as a black magicians mouth was pierced by Doran’s dagger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The best! By relying on the strength of the NPC, I really could complete this quest! Truly a fantastic quest! It seemed pathetic that I had been trying so hard to refuse the quest a few minutes ago!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I could barely chase Doran with my slow pace, thanks to Doran occasionally stopping.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Are you waiting for me? How kind. Hehe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doran was looking around with a terrible expression.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"These guys have started to use their heads.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I looked around like Doran and saw that the black magicians were chanting spells at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Blessed souls underground.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Use your grudges and fears to ensnare the enemy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Those who feel fear will have their legs restrained.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Their minds will be crushed and they will lose their willpower.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Become a doll with a lost soul!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The black magicians chanting the spell alone would be stopped by Doran before they finished. Therefore, the group shared the spell by chanting the sentences one by one.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Those sentences would connect to form one spell and the magic would be cast.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Be prepared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I grabbed Doran’s collar and said,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Be prepared? You should do something!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It is too late.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dammit!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuoooooh!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A line of blood was drawn on Doran’s face, and black energy rose like a mist to cover Doran.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“N-No! I am finished if you die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I had boarded the same boat as Doran and Doran was the oarsman. I couldn’t escape the quest failing if I was alone on this boat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I cursed and shouted towards Doran, who was coughing up blood.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Fuck! If it was going to be like this, you shouldn’t have made me feel expectant in the first place!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A green light flowed from the ring Doran was wearing and surrounded him. Then Doran's complexion was gradually restored.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘W-What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doran attacked the surprised black magicians, who were chanting new spells.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This ring is special. It protects the wearer from curses and poisons; however, the protection isn’t perfect. The damage is cumulative, so I need to avoid as much magic as possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes, indeed! The great Doran is even wearing a small ring like this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The ring was clearly had an Epic or higher rating. Was there a way to obtain it?&nbsp;</span><span style="">As I was thinking, Doran started to slaughter the enemies again. He allowed a few magic spells to be cast but eventually succeeded in creating a path.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doran started at the entrance of the staircase leading to the basement.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Come on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yep!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Unlike my vigorous reply, I chased Doran down the stairs at a slow pace.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The black magicians pursued us with spells, but they were no threat because Doran threw daggers as soon as he heard chanting.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Young Lady!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doran and I arrived at the dark basement.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Doran found a beautiful woman bound to the altar in the center of the basement and ran to her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there was a crowd blocking him. There were a dozen black magicians.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I laughed at them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“These ridiculous bastards! They need more people than that to be our opponents! Now, Doran! Get rid of them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Of course!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doran nodded and wielded his daggers in front of him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Doran might be tired, but the number of opponents was too small.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was excited as I imagined the black magicians turning into grey light.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The quest clear signal was right around the corner.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"3,600,000 won and the earl’s daughter, here I come!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Tatatang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was an unexpected result.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The hidden weapons that were thrown by Doran suddenly stopped and fell to the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Doran’s advance was also stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shield?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Defense magic couldn’t be used by black magicians. It was only possible for black magicians who completed their second class advancement.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As I was baffled, a young woman walked out from among the black magicians. It was a woman who boasted the best beauty, a unique beauty that caused the beauty of the noble young lady to pale in comparison.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Somehow, she looked familiar?&nbsp;</span><span style="">I checked her name and was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Blood Witch!!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Blood Witch.&nbsp;</span><span style="">ID: Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Korean user who was ranked number one on the black magician ranking and ranked number five on the unified rankings. She was a famous person who frequently appeared on TV because of her beautiful appearance and outstanding abilities.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why was she here?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura looked towards me and stretched out a hand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I’m sorry, but I can’t allow you to take away the sacrifice.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A red fire sword emerged from Yura’s hand. Its momentum was fierce.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unlike a black magician who didn’t have a lot of attack magic, she was well versed in it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was intimidated as I saw the flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Did I get this far, only to die?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why the hell was she here?&nbsp;</span><span style="">As despair filled my body, a notification window popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have been hit by a blow!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A legend doesn’t die easily. You can resist all attacks for 5 seconds with the minimum amount of health.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I had one health point remaining.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I had temporarily forgotten about it, but the attribute of my title was activated and I temporarily had an immortal body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura’s face was perplexed as she saw that I survived, despite being hit by her magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That was clearly a critical hit... Based on the equipment, you are only around level 80. So how are you fine after being hit by that attack?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura asked while hiding herself behind the black magicians in preparation for Doran’s counterattack.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She always had a calm smile on TV, so I was probably the only one who had seen Yura’s flustered expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I ran forward and shouted to Doran,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Quickly! Let’s finish it in five seconds! I’ll use my body to block their attacks, so Doran must kill them! I believe in you, Doran! My god!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The spells of all the black magicians, including Yura, were concentrated on me. This meant that Doran could strike freely. The best development.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Yes, hit me! No matter how you hit, I won’t die!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Today would be the day where an ordinary user would stand up to a ranker.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I narrowed the gap towards Yura as all types of curses and attack spells hit me, while Doran followed the path I made and dealt devastation to all the black magicians. Then Doran stepped on my back and jumped towards Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura blocked his attack despite being in a state of confusion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, Doran’s momentum rose.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘We can win!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But was it because Doran stepped on my back?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have died.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“......?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Eh? Eeeeh?&nbsp;</span><span style="">I wanted to reject this situation, but reality was cruel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A new notification window popped up as my vision turned grey.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Quest failed!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your level has dropped by 2.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You are now level -3.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[As you have died two times within 24 hours, you won’t be able to connect to the game for 12 hours.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hah, it somehow turned out like this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I gazed towards Doran fighting... No, my last sight as I closed my eyes was that damned Blood Witch.</span></p>
