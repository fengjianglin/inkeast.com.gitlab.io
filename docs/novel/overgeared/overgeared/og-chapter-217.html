 <p><span style="">Chapter 217</span></p>

 <p><span style="">“Damn! What is this? I knew things were going too well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His fate changed after becoming Pagma's Descendant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the past, he lived an unlucky life. After becoming Pagma’s Descendant, most of the results were positive, no matter what hardship he went through.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But why did he have to go through hardship everywhere he went?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Did he have to accept it just because things worked out well?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid suppressed his anger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He looked around at all the people before asking,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Isn’t this the kingdom’s second largest city? Doesn’t that mean it’s rich? So why are the people in this state? Eh? Were they robbed by a group of thieves or something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“In the past, it was the richest city in the kingdom; however, everything changed 10 years ago when the giant worms appeared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The giant worms? What do those monsters have to do with Reidan?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel explained to Grid,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“This is what Faker found out after questioning the administrator and the people here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">10 years ago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Reidan was the second largest city after Reinhardt and was called the second capital of the kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, this situation changed once the giant worms appeared on a large scale.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The giant worms ravaging the land were so strong that they couldn’t be subjugated with a regular army. They quickly turned the western part of the kingdom into a desert, leading to a shortage in resources and supplies, including water.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">To make matters worse, all types of desert monsters started to appear. This situation got so bad that it Reidan was eventually isolated from the kingdom around it, falling into a food shortage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Large-scale support from the kingdom became impossible so the former lord of Reidan gave up. Hundreds of thousands of people were forced to leave their home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But some people didn’t leave.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was due to the circumstances of each people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">40,000 people remained behind in Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"They had to prioritize protecting the rivers and lakes that hadn’t been dried up yet. But with their strength, they couldn’t protect the rivers and lakes from monsters.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">King Wiesbaden tried to help by searching for talent to rebuild the west. However, there was no one good except for Earl Ashur, and Earl Ashur couldn’t leave Patrian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"In the end, people were unable to get help from the kingdom and chose the empire. They asked the empire to be saved and the empire readily accepted. It was a chance to absorb part of the land of the Eternal Kingdom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The empire dispatched the Black Knights.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Black Knights were the second strongest knights after the Red Knights. But it was impossible for them to completely get rid of all the monsters in the west.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“At this point, the empire had to make a decision. In order to obtain the west, they would have to commit a large force. And that is a big burden from the position of the empire.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Finally, the empire made a choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“They will protect the Hebend River directly connected to Reidan from the monsters. In return, the people of Reiden will have to make an offering to the empire every year. They offered that deal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It is a reasonable proposal. The people of Reidan would’ve had to accept.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That’s right. But the problem was that the amount of wealth the empire asked for grew every year.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to the protection of the empire, the people of Reidan were able to relieve the food shortage through farming. The economy was slowly revived, but so what?&nbsp;</span><span style="">They became poor again after giving their wealth to the empire every year. Finally, there was a food crisis again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"In the end, the people of Reidan reached the point where they couldn’t listen to the demands of the empire anymore. The empire withdrew their forces and as a result, there were only 20,000 people left in Reidan. They were on the brink of starvation. This was the situation when we arrived.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid couldn’t believe it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Why did the kingdom abandon Reidan? It might be impossible to get rid of the monsters in the west, but isn’t it possible to give them the minimum of supplies?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"There was no merit. They didn’t feel the value of helping the foolish people who won’t abandon a land that can’t be rebuilt.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was cold but the right decision.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At least, Grid thought so.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Yes, I understand the position of the kingdom. So in the end, aren’t the people of the kingdom the real issue at hand? Why would they insist on staying in Reidan, in spite the circumstances? Isn’t it a simple fix if they just leave?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It is unfortunate... 10 years ago, the lord recruited troops to raid the vampire lair. Most of the people who didn’t leave Reidan are the families of the young men conscripted to the vampire raid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"They don’t know when their sons or husbands will return so they remained in Reidan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That’s right. As you know, this world is different from modern society and the reunion of separated families is almost impossible...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">10 years ago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The giant worms emerged soon after the vampire raid began. And Reidan fell in just five months.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The vampire subjugation troops were scheduled to return in half a year, so the families of the soldiers had to wait until then.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They waited one year, two years, three years, four years, etc, but the vampire subjugation team didn’t return.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the family members kept staying in Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The result was that 10 years passed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">40,000 people waited for the vampire subjugation team, but half of them gave up or starved to death.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"They have been waiting 10 years for the vampire subjugation team’s return, despite the fact that the troops have probably been annihilated... Blood relationships are scary.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid thought that the people of Reiden were stupid, but he also felt compassion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because his family probably would’ve made the same choice if they were in the same position as the people of Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The conclusion is that the former lord is a stupid jerk? Why did he try to clear the vampire lairs?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Until the giant worms appeared, the vampires were the only threat to Reidan. The vampire lairs are somewhere in the west and the vampires often used the people of Reidan as their food. The former lord made an unavoidable decision.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vampire Duke Marie Rose.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid recalled the vampire that he met in the past on the way to the pope and shuddered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Are the vampires still active these days?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No. Vampires haven’t appeared since monsters emerged in the west. Considering the strength of the vampires, they wouldn’t have been wiped out by the monsters. So it is possible that they turned the monsters into their food source.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That is lucky. Um... So? What should I do next?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel answered instantly as if it were obvious,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“We need to focus on clearing the fields.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the nine days of Grid’s absence, the Overgeared members defeated the monsters around Hebend River and connected the waterways to the fields.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now it was a beautiful sight because they worked hard with the people to clear the fields.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Labor is good. The sight of the people sweating while working is beautiful.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid hated doing it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I am the duke yet I have to work in the fields with the people? Isn’t this too much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel shrugged at Grid’s obvious dislike.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You don’t have to. You have a different workspace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel received Grid’s command and brought Khan to this place. As soon as they got here, he gave support staff to Khan to build a facility.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That's right, it was a smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Please do your duties as a legendary blacksmith. There is a limit to the amount of farming equipment that can be produced by Khan alone. Please help him produce a large quantity of farming equipment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A legendary blacksmith needed to make farmer’s tools?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hey, what’s with that look you’re giving me?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel scolded Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"We need your strength to revive Reidan, and you want to refuse? Don’t you feel any sense of responsibility as the Lord?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid acquiesced and no longer complained loudly,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...I was lacking in understanding.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I became too arrogant after I became a duke.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Only farming equipment?&nbsp;</span><span style="">A blacksmith couldn’t afford to have the word ‘only’ in their minds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid regained his pride as a blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In his mind, he threw away his futile bravado and rolled up his sleeves. Then he pulled out his blacksmith’s hammer and declared,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Believe in me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel’s face twisted as he heard the ominous words. But he thought about it and became relieved.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘In the first place, farming equipment with a rating other than normal doesn’t exist, so I don’t have to worry.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Combat class users had no idea about production and production items. They weren’t interested because there were few opportunities to use it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A hammer was just a hammer, a pickaxe was just a pickaxe, a hoe was just a hoe etc.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Moreover, most of the production items distributed had a normal rating.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Blacksmiths aimed for mass production so it was less likely for a production class item to have a high-rating.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But who was Grid?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He always invested at least 20 hours, no matter what item he was making, and had already produced a legendary rated hammer and pickaxe.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Then I’m going. I’ll go to work.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He would produce the best farming equipment that could be used easily, even by those who were starving and had no strength!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid pledged as he entered the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel shouted after him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"By the way Grid, who are these two people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ah.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was reminded of Piaro and Bland and told the two people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“This is what happened, so I’ll have to stay in the smithy for a while. In the meantime, you will be bored. Right? Shouldn’t you move your body to avoid being bored? Right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“If I look around the city and train Bland some more, I won’t be bored.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro gave his opinion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid responded like he didn’t hear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will tell you how to relieve your boredom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s finger pointed to the fields.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro and Bland were always in the best position because of their noble family and their natural talents, so they couldn’t grasp Grid’s intentions at first. They never imagined that there would be a person who assigned them to work in the fields.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Help me clear the fields. Please.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bland was astonished.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was an elite of the kingdom with the best bloodline flowing through him! A cornerstone of the kingdom was made to do field work?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No, he could understand since he was a hostage. But wasn’t Piaro a former captain of a troop of knights, and also one of the best swordsmen on the continent? Despite his great achievements, he was still forced to work in the fields?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bland thought that Grid was crazy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But what was this?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Physical training is good to increase the body’s stamina. Moreover, since I’ve never had experience working in the field, it is an opportunity to develop muscles I haven’t used very well or to experience new movements. I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro readily accepted?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Great Swordsman.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The one closest to becoming a sword saint positively evaluated the field work and started stretching, so Bland fell silent and also started loosening up his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Are you really working in the fields?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He hadn’t expected Piaro to accept his request.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why so easily?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro saw Grid’s confused face and said.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I have regained my motivation after being with you and Bland for the past nine days. I don’t want revenge to be my whole life. You will get revenge for me sooner or later, so I have to shake off the past and try to live in the future. I’m not a noble anymore, so it is a good idea to learn about the lives of the common people in advance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid bowed respectfully to him not only to thank him for his help in the fields but also for his willingness to live.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'A person like that was affected by me...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had enough influence to change someone’s life.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He realized this thanks to Piaro and thought deeply.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A lord is a person who rules over tens of thousands of people. He was also a guild master who led the Overgeared members. He should never forget. My thoughts and actions can change the fate of a large number of people.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid vowed to become more mature every time he experienced certain events.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he couldn’t abandon his inherent nature and was prone to losing his prudence whenever he was in a hurry. So he thought that he should manage himself more thoroughly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He left Winston for the west.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the moment that Grid’s heart once again grew in response to Piaro’s words.</span></p>
