 <p><span style="">Chapter 405</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">In order to raise Reidan’s fertility rate, you must set an example as the lord.</span></i> <i><span style="">Please share your hot love even more where people are watching.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel meant to actively express positive affection.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A simple example was to stroke her cheek or whisper loving words in her ears. He wanted to engrave the perception ‘this couple’s relationship is beautiful and happy!’ into the public.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Grid misunderstood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This guy has seen too many Japanese videos.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why would he share a hot love in front of everyone?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wasn’t a hot love beyond kissing?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Doing this act in the middle of the city, not the bedroom, and in front of more than 20,000 people?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was impossible unless he was a complete pervert. It was a completely crazy idea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">W-What is it?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel saw the contempt in Grid’s eyes and panicked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the day when the pure youth Lauel was labelled as a pervert.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">And on this day.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel was disappointed with Grid’s uncooperative attitude and made a pledge.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will take initiative for My Lord.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel’s project to create a second generation had begun.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was at this time that the legendary ‘Reidan's Female NPC Strategy’ was written.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">It was only six days before the National Competition and Grid was supposed to leave for France in four days.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Based on Satisfy, Grid had 12 days to spare.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I must finish all the preparations.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thus, he hurriedly returned to Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now wasn’t the time to be like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I love you, but I’m sorry. Please be satisfied with this today."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Time was short.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid saw Irene’s nakedness after a long time and used his hand techniques.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...I love you, dear husband.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s dexterity stat had long gone beyond the realm of a human.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid satisfied Irene in a short amount of time and left for the smithy.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Reidan’s super large smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan and the young blacksmiths welcomed Grid, who had been missing for a few months.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid observed Khan with the Great Lord's Sword and felt admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Advanced level 8?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In fact, Grid had thought Khan’s blacksmithing skill would stagnate at advanced level 7.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But in contrast to his expectations, Khan was steadily developing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The process of training talented young blacksmiths seemed to give Khan a new understanding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Maybe you have a chance to become a craftsman?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Huhu, you are overrating me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Historically, only 10 blacksmith craftsmen had emerged.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan didn’t dare aim to be recognized as a craftsman.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid thought differently.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Khan is Albatino’s descendant. He comes from a long bloodline of blacksmiths and has more passion than anyone. If I support him well, he can become a craftsman.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Maybe he would be reborn as a named NPC.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid felt greedy as he headed towards the furnace located in the innermost area of the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A typical furnace was always dirty, but Grid’s was clean.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was thanks to Khan always cleaning it for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Really, I’m touched by that old man every time.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His first friend, Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He prayed for the old man to live as long as possible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s eyes were red as he started to prepare the firewood, while the young blacksmiths freaked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Duke Grid! Let us do these menial tasks!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It isn’t your duty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was impressive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Two years ago in real time, he had been told by the old blacksmith in Bairan that he couldn’t even cut firewood. Now he was in a position where he shouldn’t be cutting them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He realized that he had become successful.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid laughed and waved to the young blacksmiths.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You can go and do your work. Today, I want to go back to my state of mind as a beginner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid thought that going through all the blacksmithing processes would improve his concentration.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He prepared enough firewood and lit the furnace.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Tak!</span></i> <i><span style="">Tatak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The flames in the furnace started to slowly rise.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid controlled the temperature of the flames and suddenly laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If Braham saw this, he would be laughing at me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He would’ve argued that he could’ve raised the temperature of the flames instantly with magic power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But right now, Braham was silent. To be precise, he fell asleep just after using Assimilation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Did this mean that Grid used Assimilation recently?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid hadn’t use Assimilation during the past fortnight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reason why Braham was exhausted and sleeping was due to what happened when Grid died on the 61st island some time ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I don’t want to go to hell.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had used Blackening against Lantier, and was in danger of falling into hell due to dying in the Blackening state.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Braham said that if he fell into hell in this state, he would fall prey to the great demons. Therefore, he suppressed the dark gate trying to suck Grid into hell with magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In exchange, a message was added to Grid’s current status window.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Braham has 69 days, 9 hours, 3 minutes, and 15 seconds left to restore his magic power and wake up. You can’t use the Assimilation skill until Braham wakes up *</span></p>
 <p><span style="">By the time 69 days passed in Satisfy time, the National Competition would be coming to an end.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In other words, Grid had lost a powerful weapon in the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid wasn’t shaken.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He believed he could play a role in the National Competition alone, without Braham’s help.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will make that belief come true.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He needed items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He realized that there was a limit to developing his control. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t be a genius like Kraugel and the Overgeared members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, he needed to make the best items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Horse knight’s helmet, troll lord’s vest, crying ogre’s gauntlets and golden crown’s leggings.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In addition, Lantier’s cloak.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid wanted to reproduce some of the items of the monsters he met in the latter half of the Behen Archipelago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because he needed new, more powerful armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The Holy Light set is really good. But...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Holy Light Armor had a high probability of resisting dark magic, increased the effectiveness of healing magic by 300%, and increased resistance to physical attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Holy Light Gloves raised attack speed and accuracy, and had a low chance of activating the 5 Joint Attacks skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Holy Light Crown raised his intelligence and dignity stats.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Once these three items were worn as a set, defense and health rose significantly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was why Grid had been steadily using it since level 170.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yes, the Holy Light Set was very good.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If it was half a year to a year ago, I would still be able to call it a top-class armor.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But not anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As the level of monsters and users increased, the value of the Holy Light set was falling.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was able to realize it after meeting Kraugel and experiencing the Behen Archipelago.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The problem is that the basic defense is too low.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In particular, the crown and gloves had poor defense. It was almost defenseless.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the case of the Holy Light Armor, it wasn’t bad, but the defense wasn’t very high for armor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If there was no set effect, he wouldn’t have used it from the beginning.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The 5 Joint Attacks of the gloves isn’t too bad.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At this point, the only advantage of the Holy Light Set was for healing or when facing magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This thought became more widespread after dying from two of Lantier’s blows.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have to make an armor set for defense.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Monsters easily neutralized his attacks in the Behen Archipelago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would gather the characteristics of the armor they were wearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘First.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid confirmed that the furnace was at the right temperature and extracted the black iron and ogre blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Let’s make the troll lord’s breastplate.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">From the time he became duke of Reidan until the present time, he’d earned around 147,000 gold from hunting and various quests. Of course, there was a separate sum that he invested into Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In any case, 147,000 gold was approximately 200 million won.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was planning to pour all of this gold into making items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will use the finest materials.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the best stage of Satisfy that the entire world was paying attention to.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid needed to invest enough to prove his worth on that stage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the concept of ‘enough’ wasn’t understood properly by Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In fact, 200 million wasn’t a big sum.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The rankers of various countries participating in the National Competition poured at least billions of won into upgrading items and skill books.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Were they crazy?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Not at all. This was a realistic amount.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were many sponsors attracted to the rankers participating in the National Competition, so money poured out abundantly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Of course, many companies offered to sponsor Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, Grid refused.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because the amount was too small.&nbsp;</span><span style="">None of the companies set a high price on Grid, who had been nerfed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most companies predicted that Grid would lose his events, so the average value they offered was 300 million.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was low compared to rankers like Chris and Zibal, who had been offered 12 times as much.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s pride was hurt and he had to refuse the offers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Someone might think he was stupid for kicking away 300 million because of his pride.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid thought differently.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will get the best result.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Companies that sponsored him would get astronomical results.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid knew this fact, so accepting only 300 million won would make his stomach cramp with irritation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid vowed again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would prove his worth to those who underestimated him and make them shed tears.</span>.</p>
