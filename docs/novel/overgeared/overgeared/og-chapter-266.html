 <p><span style="">Chapter 266</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s baffling.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid.</span> <span style="">He was a very special person for the Rebecca Church.</span> <span style="">The hero who saved their church by punishing the corrupt Pope Drevigo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Most of the members praised Grid’s feat.</span> <span style="">A big wave was unavoidable if he claimed to be Damian’s guardian.</span> <span style="">Numerous members were likely to support Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘That Damian, he was preparing for his loss.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a deadly move.</span> <span style="">The elders never imagined that such a foolish guy would call someone big like Grid to help him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s a crisis.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The election wasn’t the only method that Grid could help Damian.</span> <span style="">By sealing Lifael’s Spear, it was possible to remove Damian’s weakness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Ah, this is a quandary.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Unlike the elders, Pascal’s face was relaxed.</span> <span style="">He had experience with Grid, and could turn this crisis into an opportunity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid isn’t a hero.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reason why Grid defeated Drevigo.</span> <span style="">It wasn’t for the Rebecca Church, but for Grid himself.</span> <span style="">Pascal knew the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He said he killed Drevigo because he needed to bless the odd mineral called pavranium.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was selfish and violent.</span> <span style="">At the time that the pavranium received God Judar’s blessing, Pascal had peeked at Grid’s nature.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The more selfish a person is, the easier it is to handle them.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why was Grid claiming to be Damian’s guardian?</span> <span style="">It was because there was something good in it for him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ssik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal smiled widely.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid, I can give more to you than Damian.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Wealth, power, and beauty.</span> <span style="">He would give Grid everything he wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘So leave Damian and come to me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If he could get Grid on his side, he could unseal all three divine artifacts as well as win the election.</span> <span style="">It was a great opportunity to become pope with the strongest Rebecca’s Daughters.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pascal had this thought and broke the uncomfortable silence.</span> <span style="">“Hey hey! Who is this? The savior of the Rebecca Church! Hero among heroes! If it isn’t Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal exclaimed while smiling as brightly as possible. He praised Grid with exaggerated words and shook hands with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I’m so glad to see you again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This guy, he can smile instead of feeling angry after my blatant provocation?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an unexpected response.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He was like this in the past.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had taken the Holy Light set that Pascal wanted. But rather than being hostile to Grid, Pascal welcomed him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He thanked Grid for punishing Drevigo, held a banquet and gave God Judar’s blessing without any conditions.</span> <span style="">He was someone to watch out for. Pascal was someone reluctant to make strong enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have to provoke him some more.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid thought this and responded to the handshake.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Nice to see you as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal’s spirit rose at Grid’s response.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s like this. I don’t know about the other elders, but he shouldn’t be rude to me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid should also be aware of it.</span> <span style="">The fact that Pascal would be more helpful than Damian.</span> <span style="">Pascal was filled with confidence and quickly led the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You’re a duke of the Eternal Kingdom? You’re truly a hero. Your outstanding abilities have been recognized. Now, let’s move the location. I will prepare a reunion celebration banquet, so let’s talk to each other after a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian paled as he watched the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid and Pascal knew each other?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was serious.</span> <span style="">Pascal was extremely rich. Grid could be tempted by money.</span> <span style="">As Damian was worrying, Pascal nailed in the final wedge.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Sir Grid, I will prepare many gifts for you today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hoh, gifts. i am looking forward to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid started to show interest.</span> <span style="">Damian was frustrated, while Pascal showed a deep smile.</span> <span style="">It was at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"But Pascal, I’m a duke, right?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid gripped the hand he was shaking with more strength.</span> <span style="">Pascal’s face rapidly twisted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is this...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an incredible grip.</span> <span style="">Pascal started to feel pain in his hands. He struggled, but Grid didn’t let go.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You aren’t a pope yet. A pope candidate is asking for a handshake instead of politely greeting me? You seem to be making fun of me, Pascal. Was it a lie when you praised me as a hero?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'You’re just the duke of a small kingdom!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal was a noble of the Saharan Empire.</span> <span style="">He recognized all nations apart from the empire as small, and thought they were barbaric.</span> <span style="">He was a nationalist who believed that only the empire should be blessed by Goddess Rebecca.</span> <span style="">For Pascal, there was no humiliation worse than being treated like this by &nbsp;a noble of a small kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this violence? Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal yelled, then became filled with consternation the moment he met Grid’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘You...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was unable to read the emotions or measure the depth in Grid’s eyes.</span> <span style="">He didn’t know the intentions, but Grid had such profound eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s eyes were showing a clear meaning.</span> <span style="">A provocation.</span> <span style="">‘Bring it on Pascal. I want to destroy you.’</span> <span style="">Grid’s eyes were clearly saying that.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A beast!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment that Pascal was feeling agitated, someone fell from the ceiling.</span> <span style="">A knight wearing red armor.</span> <span style="">His name was Kamiyan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The 30th knight of the Red Knights, the emperor gave him to Pascal in the hope that Pascal would become the pope.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kamiyan warned with his sword at Grid’s neck.</span> <span style="">Grid snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What if I don’t want to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will cut off your hand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kamiyan showed no hesitation.</span> <span style="">His sword moved towards the hand that was holding Pascal’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal shouted, "Stop!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kamiyan’s sword stopped just above Grid’s wrist.</span> <span style="">Grid’s eyes narrowed from where he had been able to summon Failure from the inventory.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Too bad.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal barely managed to escape from Grid’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Sir Grid, I will close my eyes to your rudeness today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You don’t have to? I told you already. If you have a complaint then come forward. Bring it on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Anger boiled inside Pascal’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was the son of a Saharan noble, who had gained a high status after joining the Rebecca Church. This was the first time that he had been treated like this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pascal couldn’t be rational or prudent anymore. In his heart, he wanted to tell Kamiyan to immediately hit Grid’s neck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he had to endure it.</span> <span style="">He needed Grid’s strength to release the seals on the three divine artifacts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I hope that we can laugh with each other when we meet again soon. I will always have a gift for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal withdrew with a red face. Kamiyan and the elders followed him.</span> <span style="">Grid’s face was filled with regret as he looked at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘His endurance is great.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid couldn’t attack senior NPC priests first.</span> <span style="">As long as they weren’t abandoned by the goddess like Drevigo, they were always protected by the goddess.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he attacked them first, the goddess would curse him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Goddess’ Curse]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The unlucky stat will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The unlucky stat was vague since it wasn’t a status condition. Grid was reluctant to be cursed by the goddess.</span> <span style="">That’s why he tried to provoke Pascal, but eventually failed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Well, don’t be nervous and just wait.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">From Pascal’s point of view, Grid was an eyesore.</span> <span style="">He would eventually attack Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After Pascal and the elders left.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Isabel, who had remained silent the whole time, approached Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It has been a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a dissatisfied voice.</span> <span style="">It seemed like she had something to complain about.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I hate you.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Isabel was plagued with terrible pain because of Grid.</span> <span style="">This situation happened because Grid forgot to seal Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I'm sorry.”</span> <span style="">Grid sincerely apologized.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Isabel gritted her teeth at the sight of him.</span> <span style="">"Why are you sorry? Are you apologizing for unsealing Lifael’s Spear? Don’t make me laugh. I was able to save my friends thanks to you releasing the seal. Thanks to you, the entire church was saved. So don’t apologize.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She was grateful.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Then why is she angry?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tears filled Isabel’s eyes while Grid was puzzled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You always do this. Why do you only show up when I’m in a desperate crisis? Like a prince on a white horse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Isabel had a crush on Grid.</span> <span style="">Her emotions were stimulated because she was saved just before falling to hell.</span> <span style="">But Grid had already ignored her once.</span> <span style="">It would be the same this time as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You won’t accept me anyway, so why are you acting like this…?”</span> <span style="">Isabel whispered as she bowed her head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her words didn’t reach Grid. The problem was that her voice was too small.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Her condition is strange. Indeed, she must be in a lot of pain.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid watched Isabel.</span> <span style="">Her beautiful platinum hair was now close to grey and it wasn’t even shiny. Her lustrous red lips were pale and her skinny body looked like a mummy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was a bigger problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Her breasts have decreased in size.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the effect of losing weight.</span> <span style="">Her original B cup breasts were now an A cup.</span> <span style="">It was really a pity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-Where are you looking? Pervert!”</span> <span style="">Isabel covered her chest with her arms and shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What is there to look at?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is there to look at? What does that mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Do I need to explain?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That’s okay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It had been a really long time since Isabel had been so energetic.</span> <span style="">Damian watched her and Grid and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Isabel-chan, you have always missed Grid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He hoped her heart would be communicated to Grid.</span> <span style="">He truly was cheering her on.</span> <span style="">Damian wasn’t a rival for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s natural for the heroine to be connected with the hero.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was just an extra. He was too incompetent, so he was satisfied just watching Rebecca’s Daughters from the side.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Huroi approached Damian and whispered. "Don't worry. She doesn’t fit My Lord’s taste.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The beautiful Isabel-chan didn’t suit Grid’s taste?</span> <span style="">It was upsetting.</span> <span style="">Damian was making a subtle expression when Grid urged him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“How long are we going to stand here? Guide me to a suitable place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was time to figure out how to create and seal Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
