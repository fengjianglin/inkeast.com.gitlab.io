 <p><span style="">Chapter 415</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Tira had three mountains.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The highest mountain was 723 meters above sea level and was the closest area to the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was no better place to aim for the targets moving around in the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The team that won this spot?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The United States.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the inevitable result.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The seven US representatives were all third advancement classes and had the best names.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">1st among the 10 Rookies, a Genius among Geniuses, Grid’s Brain, Chunni...&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel had many titles, and even he was merely ordinary in the US team. They had many business cards among them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Lauel, this child.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon, who had been struggling to occupy the highlands, was hit by a landslide and fell down a cliff.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The culprit who caused the landslide was Lauel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuoong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon barely inserted his spear into the cliff and saved himself from crashing down, but it was dangerous.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wouldn’t be unusual for Pon to be logged out if he fell down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Attack Zibal... Ugh!}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{This! Zephyr is preventing the use of my skills!}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Dammit! Skull is behind you!!}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{L-Lauel is causing another landslide...! Kuaaack!}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon was isolated and the Spanish team’s party chat window was frenzied.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The seven Spanish rankers were strong, but it wasn’t enough against the United States. The average power of the United States was overwhelming.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘That Lauel, he’s the same as always, but now he is so scary.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was unfortunate that they overlapped with the US team.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘We need to give up on the medal.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon saw his colleagues being logged out one by one and pulled out the spear rammed in the cliff.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then as he fell, he used his last remaining mana to fire a blow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The target was the back of Zibal’s head at the top of the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will make you a friend on my journey.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pajik!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pajijik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Lightning formed around the red spear held in Pon’s hand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the precursor of Rail Spear, which used electromagnetic force to shoot the spear faster than the speed of sound.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kurururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The cliff where countless joys and sorrows were taking place.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Light shone in that dark place and a thunderous roar was heard.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moment the sound was heard, the spear was already almost at Zibal’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal’s eyes widened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dragon Claws. Wind Dragon’s Roar.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kurururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel considered Pon’s nature and predicted this situation, using two skills at the same time to protect Zibal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He summoned a wind to slow down the speed of the Rail Spear, then caused the ground to raise, creating a barrier to block the weakened Rail Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But it was useless. The power of the Rail Spear was too strong. It simply tore down the wind and earth barrier in its way.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel failed to protect Zibal and Zibal received a big blow. He would need to withdraw from battle for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Poooooon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Hat! Hahahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal’s shriek of rage was heard from the top of the mountain, while Pon laughed loudly from the bottom.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This battlefield was becoming more intense.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Pon has been logged out! The Spanish team has been annihilated! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Spain couldn’t win against the United States. The United States is really strong! I can guarantee that the United States is the strongest at team events! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the start of the event, the Korean team and the teams that allied against them were struggling against each other.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Brazil team, led by Jishuka, moved secretly and reached the depths of the northern forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is there a need to fight? You shouldn’t forget the fundamental purpose of shooting the target.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Truly a godly archer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka fired without a break, quickly taking care of the flying targets in the area.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka handled several more targets and asked the team members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huhu, how about it? Aren’t we first?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Of course! Eh?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A Brazilian ranker responded and then checked the scoreboard, only to feel shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No matter how they looked at it, the score was strange.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka became anxious when she saw him stiffen and checked the scoreboard. Then she was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">1st. South Korea - 41 points. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">2nd. Brazil - 23 points. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">3rd. United States &nbsp;- 18 points. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">4th. Russia - 11 points. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What... What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How could Korea flourish, despite being the target of various teams from the beginning?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The confused Jishuka burst out laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The God Hands.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was facing the allied teams, while the God Hands were destroying the targets in the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The God Hands were very simple and easy to control, so it was possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“He’s truly a great man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka couldn’t understand why Grid destroyed the targets and attracted aggro the moment the game started.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now she sensed Grid’s deep meaning.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The God Hands have completely disappeared from the minds of the enemies. Grid is taking advantage of his presence.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He even used Yura as bait.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the current battlefield, it was rare for people to be aware of the presence of the God Hands in the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If South Korea was able to withstand the barrage, they would obviously obtain the medal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Since the allied teams were mostly weaker countries that couldn’t have won medals in the first place, it was likely that Korea could endure the alliance’s offensive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Apart from Grid, South Korea also had Yura and Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid, you’re great. But I'm sorry. The gold medal is mine.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka only started the target hunting after entering the forest and securing her safety.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In other words, she started the match very late compared to the South Korean team.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Nevertheless, the gap was gradually narrowing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Brazil team could safely concentrate on the target hunting, while South Korea had to deal with enemy teams. Thus, there was a difference in speed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, Jishuka’s archery was very great.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Grid, be satisfied with the silver medal.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka knew how to distinguish between public and private matters. She didn’t worry about her colleagues and wanted respect.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kkirik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka pulled her bowstring while feeling sorry to Grid in her heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She would win the gold medal, become stronger, and get the title of strongest woman. Her gaze became more intense and sexier.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, her brightly shining eyes soon became shaken.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I can’t leave you alone, so I came after you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A low voice was heard from the dark forest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The owner of the charming voice showed up between the trees.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka and the Brazilian rankers paled as they saw him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“T-The sky above the sky...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 1st ranked user, Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His waist long hair was tied up and his beautiful eyes shone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I’m sorry, but I have to do this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He would make Russia 1st on the overall rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the condition of payment for the new drug developed by the Russian government that would help Kraugel’s mother.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kraugel only accepted these terms for his mother.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He vowed to knock down the competitors, trample on them and lead Russia to victory.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His goal in the target processing match was to assassinate the ranged dealers, and Jishuka was his fifth victim.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unlike Grid, Kraugel had stealthily and faithfully acted in his role as a close range damage dealer to assassinate four ranged dealers while Grid was attracting the public’s attention.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They didn’t even know it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Who said I will be easy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She didn’t think she would be caught by such a big person...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka felt astonished, frustrated, and desperate as she pulled back her bowstring.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kkirik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The bow that originally aimed at the target switched to Kraugel...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Godly archer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The arrow of the godly archer that exceeded the human condition left the bowstring.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kiiiing-!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The arrow rotated and split into five arrows, exploding and blocking Kraugel’s escape.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka pulled her bowstring again during the time when Kruagel was delayed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was hoping that Kraugel was alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘First of all, I will deal as much damage as possible while the team members take up a pincer formation.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They had a chance of winning, even if the opponent was Kraugel. The 14th ranked Jishuka was qualified to make this positive analysis.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, her opponent was the sky above the sky, who made even gods insignificant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His innate skills and Keen Senses passive skill meant that he escaped most of Jishuka’s exploding arrows. Kraugel avoided big injuries and rushed through the blast towards Jishuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Oh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She didn’t think there would be someone who could emerge unscathed from that attack.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka was at a loss, but she calmly fired her bow.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Swaeek!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Sharp arrows rained down on Kraugel’s head.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Suuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel twisted and avoided the arrows.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As expected, Jishuka’s arrows exploded to try and inflict damage on Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kraugel used White Light Steps and easily avoided it. He steadily broke through the Brazilian rankers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eek!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hiik!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel’s moves weren’t as destructive as Grid and Chris, and they weren’t as dazzling as Faker or Regas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he was as strong as Grid and Chris, as fast as Faker, and as unconventional as Regas.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was like flowing water.&nbsp;</span><span style="">All of his actions seemed natural.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Why did you lose to Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel avoided Jishuka’s continuously firing arrows and eliminated the Brazil team in an instant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A few arrows hit his body, but he exquisitely avoided any fatal blows.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reason why Kraugel was called the sky above the sky, Jishuka understood after seeing it directly.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Jishuka has been logged out! The Brazil team has been wiped out! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Once again, the world is wide and there are many strong people. Right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon and Jishuka.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid didn’t know that some of the strongest people in Overgeared were eliminated in succession.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The teams from 11 countries also couldn’t have imagined.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The fact that they would be crushed by a country weak in Satisfy, South Korea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“M-Monster...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The last survivor turned to grey.&nbsp;</span><span style="">All of the team members were dead, and Grid was at the center.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was breathing roughly, but there were no obvious wounds on his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Armor that looked like it was made out of black dragon scales.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Giant red gauntlets reminiscent of an ogre’s fist.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A black cloak that changed color whenever it flapped in the wind.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Gold leggings and a plate helmet with horns rising up on both sides.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">&nbsp;Armed with new items, Grid’s appearance was like a magnificent mountain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The world was shocked because it looked like he would never collapse.</span></p>
