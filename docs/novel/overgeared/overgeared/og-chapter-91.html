 <p><span style="">Chapter 91</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Best Gauntlets’ option effect is activated, causing you to attack the target twice.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 77,311 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuaaaaak! This is ridiculoussss!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He endured the powerful attacks of several people, and finally caught the chance for a proper counterattack. He didn’t think his ankle would be caught at the last moment!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Malacus thought it was unfair as he greeted his end.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have defeated the Sixth Servant Malacus, who spread fear through the world!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Reputation throughout the continent will rise by +3.000.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Yatan Church will be forever hostile to you.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Affinity with the Rebecca Church has increased by +2,800. Visiting a Rebecca Temple will give you great blessings.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Affinity with the Dominion Church has increased by +1,500. Visiting a Dominion Temple will give you great blessings.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Affinity with the Judar Church has increased by +800. Visiting a Judar Temple will give you great blessings.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The power of the Yatan Church is extremely weakened after losing a priest. Until a new priest is elected, there will be no further expansion of its forces.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The party leader ‘Jishuka’ has acquired 382 gold.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The party leader ‘Jishuka’ has acquired 8 blessed weapon enhancement stones.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The party leader ‘Jishuka’ has acquired 10 blessed armor enhancement stones.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The party leader ‘Jishuka’ has acquired 3 high rated magic stones.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The party leader ‘Jishuka’ has acquired Malacus’ Cloak.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The party leader ‘Jishuka’ has acquired Malacus’ Mask.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The party leader ‘Jishuka’ has acquired the Dark Magic Orb.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[1,531,050 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid gained a tremendous amount of fame and high affinity with each religion!&nbsp;</span><span style="">He suddenly sat down with frustration. His face paled and he started sweating. Then after a while, he opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had nicely succeeded in the quest so everyone’s attention was focused on him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They gulped as they wondered what Grid would say.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Grid finally spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I... Items...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Items?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The party leader was set to acquire the items...! How could I make such a mistake?”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid shivered and shouted towards Jishuka.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Hey, Jishuka! Were you lying to me? You said the items would be split in half! But what’s this? Are you trying to trick me? Eh? I never thought that top rankers would try to cheat a low-level user like me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had a wild look in his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Since Grid had gobbled up all the items after the two-person raid, Grid was nervous that Jishuka would act like him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka, who was amazed by Grid being able to defeat Malacus despite being only level 95, could only sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Ugly.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">To be honest, Jishuka’s heart had palpitations at the sight of Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moment she felt despair at the raid failing, Grid triggered a reversal, looking like a character from a movie.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the raid finished and Grid’s true nature appeared again, making that pounding feeling disappear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Based on first impressions, his personality is too horrible. I don’t like it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was presumed to be a hidden class with excellent blacksmith skills and some combat capabilities.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was much bigger than the creator of the Special Jaffa Arrows they searched so long for, making her desire to get him into the guild higher.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, it was a bit hard because of his nature.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Does it matter if his personality is good? All we need is his ability.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It didn’t matter if Grid was disappointing. Even if his personality is worse, she still wanted to invite him to the guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka made a decision and reassured Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Of course I will keep the promise. Don’t worry. By the way, it is great. You managed to finish off Malacus.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The other guild members also joined in.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You are really something! How is your attack power so high despite your low level? It is more than Toban and Vantner combined. Hahaha! G-Great!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“If it wasn’t for Grid, this raid would’ve surely failed. I am impressed with your performance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Awesome..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Tzedakah Guild members were busy praising Grid. Among them was the global star, Laella.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was still young and she was thrilled because Grid seemed like the main character of a movie. She looked cute with her red cheeks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, Grid didn’t care about them. He was afraid that all his items would be eaten if he wasn’t careful.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Are you trying to make me relax so you can take the items? Right? Dammit! Do you think I will fall for such a thing? How rotten! Don’t hold out on me! Let’s distribute the items first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Ugly.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the end, the atmosphere calmed down.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka shared the item information to all party members after evaluating the three items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Malacus’ Cloak]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 35/81 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 15</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Intelligence +200</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Bloody smell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A magic cloak that Malacus liked. It was originally a cloak made of blue cloth, but it became discolored by the blood of many virgins.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 200 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 10</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Bloody Smell]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It always gives off a bloody smell. It is easy for the wearer to become a target of beasts and monsters, and makes other people offended.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Malacus’ Mask]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 11/20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Attributes Resistance: +5%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Reduces magic casting time by 20%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A black mask used by Malacus. There are no special features regarding its appearance, but Malacus treats it like a treasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 200 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 1</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Dark Magic Orb]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 90/130 &nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Damage: +14%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dark magic attack power: +20%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Number of spells that can be stored: 4</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A powerful orb used since before Malacus was appointed as Yatan’s servant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 200 or higher. More than 500 intelligence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 80</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Tzedakah Guild focused their attention on the mask and orb.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The options of the mask is very good.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes. Just raising the resistance of all attributes by 5% and the shortening of magic casting time is great. They are rare options.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It is great that a mask has these options. Almost no masks have options. So people treat masks as a simple accessory."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The orb isn’t a joke.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Well, the magic damage is low for a unique rating but the rise in dark magic is huge. Above all, there are four spells that can be stored...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t orbs usually store only two or three spells?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Just being able to store three spells is a scam. But four spells...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It will be too bad to sell both items. Our guild members should use it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were only two magicians in the Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The second-ranked mixed magician Laella and the first ranked wind magician Zednos.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The guild wanted to distribute the mask and orb to these two people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But they promised a 5:5 distribution of items to Grid. They had to give up one of the items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, Grid made an unexpected demand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I want the cloak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They made surprised expressions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because the value of the cloak was the lowest among the three items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was good that it raised intelligence by 200, but the option of Bloody Smell was a big disadvantage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In general, cloaks were items with good options, unlike masks. It wasn’t difficult to find one better than Malacus’ Cloak.&nbsp;</span><span style="">So why did he want the cloak?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What? Is he yielding the good items to us on purpose? His personality doesn’t seem like that.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid prompted the Tzedakah Guild members, who couldn’t respond quickly because they didn’t know Grid’s thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? It isn’t possible? I want the cloak. Enough though you fought him, didn’t I finish him off? Honestly, the raid would’ve failed if it wasn’t for me. But why aren’t you giving me my choice?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas eyed Grid unhappily. He wanted to tell Grid to choose something else because the cloak was least valuable.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he couldn’t open his mouth because he was afraid of damaging the guild. His face turned red as his conscience warred with his responsibility.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have to tell him the truth.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After a few minutes of conflict.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, Regas couldn’t forsake his conscience and tried to explain to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Among the three items, the value of the cloak is the lowest. Do you still want to choose the cloak?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was Jishuka.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She told the truth to Grid earlier than Regas.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Regas was so proud of his master that she smiled brightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, Grid was puzzled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why is the value of the cloak the lowest?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had completely different thoughts from the Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Tzedakah Guild thought the option of the cloak was good but disliked Bloody Smell. However, Grid thought that Bloody Smell was a big advantage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Doesn’t Bloody Smell make it easier to hunt monsters? If so, isn’t the value of the cloak as good as the mask?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had a rare excellent idea. This was evidence that Grid was growing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then why didn’t the Tzedakah Guild have the same thought as Grid?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t really the case. The Tzedakah Guild didn’t care about the concept of hunting itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Unlike Grid, they were so high in level so it was less efficient to hunt mobs. In order to enhance their combat skills and teamwork, they enjoyed hunting powerful monsters in a party.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, as Grid’s life centered around being a blacksmith, he didn’t feel the need to increase his combat skills and just wanted to level up quickly. Moreover, his hunting efficiency was very high.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Due to this difference in position, Grid and the Tzedakah Guild had different mindsets. Thus, they were able to make a transaction that satisfied both sides.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I still want the cloak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Then we will choose the mask first. What about the orb? If possible, we would like to have it as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Only if you give me money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay. We’ll give you gold equivalent to half the value of the orb.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Malacus was different from general boss monsters who periodically respawned: he was a special boss monster who didn’t resurrect upon death, so an exact quote for his items didn’t exist.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"In this case, we have to use the auction house. We will register it for 48 hours then cancel it at 47 hours and 59 minutes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid felt unwilling as he listened to Jishuka’s explanation,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Don’t you have to pay a fine if you cancel the registration of an auction item right before it is over? The fine... Do I have to pay it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We are willing to pay that much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Um... Then the division of the enhancement stones and magic stones...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The blessed enhancement stones were 1,200 gold per stone. The high rated magic stones were 4,000 gold each.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There is a total of 18 enhancement stones and 3 magic stones, so the estimated value is 33,600 gold... Divide this...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was busy calculating the money when Jishuka did something that amazed him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She handed all the enhancement stones and magic stones to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“... Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka grinned at the stunned Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"The raid would’ve failed if it wasn’t for you. Shouldn’t this belong to you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka’s smiling face was so beautiful that Grid stared with a stunned expression for a while.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Jishuka said goodbye to him,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Let’s split up and meet again in three days, where I will hand you the prepared gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Y-Yes... Okay, I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid, I have a lot of things to do today, so let’s take a break and look for your stolen item tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Regas, you’ll still help me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Of course! I promised to help, so I should see it through to the end! Then I’m going!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka, Regas, and the other Tzedakah Guild members left Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hrmm."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then Grid stopped in front of the cave where Malacus had been.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What was he doing in here?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Were there any hidden treasures?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heh... This cave stimulates the instincts of a treasure hunter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had a history of finding Pagma’s Rare Book in the Northern End Cave, so he had a desire to explore this cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Surely there isn’t anything dangerous after Malacus is gone?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid sneaked into the cave.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The cave was quite small. The cave was lit up with flaming torches.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It happened after walking around 10 steps.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid entered the cave and found a silver-haired beauty who was restrained.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was Irene, lady of Winston.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ah, this is what happened.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He made the Divine Shield and it was robbed by Malacus’ subordinate.&nbsp;</span><span style="">When he appeared, many soldiers in Winston Castle were killed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the midst of this chaos, Irene had been captured.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Um...m?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Perhaps she heard Grid talking?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Irene regained consciousness and slowly opened her eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She found Grid and smiled with relief, before starting to sob.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It was you... The one who helped Doran and saved me... Now you saved me again...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Doran? Was the one Doran wanted to save Irene?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As soon as Grid learned about Irene’s identity, a very familiar notification window popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A quest has been created.]</span></p>
