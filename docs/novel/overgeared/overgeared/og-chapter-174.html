 <p><span style="">Chapter 174</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><span style=""> “Bad person.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka muttered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Deep in the forest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She had struggled with Samuel, the weakest of the participants in the target processing match, and her anger finally exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“He ignored my whisper, only to come for another girl?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The day of the opening ceremony.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka had logged onto Satisfy in South Korea and whispered to Grid to find out his location.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid continued to ignore her whispers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At the time, Jishuka had tried to understand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He must be busy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But what was this?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t seem too busy to rescue another woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Did he ignore my whispers because he wasn’t interested in me? He didn’t want to meet up with me, so he ignored it?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She had thousands of fan clubs all over the world. Hundreds of millions of men wanted her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She had been courted by the best men, such as handsome actors, oil tycoons, and successful intellectuals.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now she was being ignored.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuaka’s pride was crushed as she was holding a Special Jaffa Arrow! It was broken in half.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She ignored it and asked Samuel,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Who is prettier between me and Yura?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The people of the world enjoyed comparing Jishuka and Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was their hobby to evaluate who was more beautiful.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t just their appearance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were often compared in all respects because they were international stars and top rankers of Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even the payment they received for their TV appearances or photo shoots was the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka recognized Yura as her rival. However, she was confident that she was superior to Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But she seemed to be defeated when it came to the man she was interested in.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She never knew that Grid and Yura were so close.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A person who would rather make items rushed to participate in the National Competition... Is Yura a special presence to him?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Samuel looked at her and responded honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Jishuka, you are much sexier. Your qualities are definitely better. Objectively, I think that you are more beautiful? But I personally prefer elegant women, so Yura seems more beautiful to me. In addition, Yura is Asian, right? She has calm eyes, no freckles, and a mysterious charm in many ways. Hehe, she is a goddess.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Shut up.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[The effect of the Special Jaffa arrow is activated, meaning the enemy’s defense is completely ignored.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Special Jaffa Arrow has poisoned the enemy.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Keok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Samuel shuddered in pain as the arrow stabbed his thigh.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Jishuka pulled back her bowstring.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I am angry.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Papapat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Her quick fire was unfolded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The targets flying between the trees and bushes exploded without being able to escape Jishuka’s arrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I am becoming heated up!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The Brazilian team’s score keep increasing thanks to her furious firing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The commentator shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Brazil 72... 73 points! Truly an expert archer! The Brazilian representative, Jishuka’s arrows ignore all obstacles and are wiping out the targets in a flash! Ah! As soon as I spoke, the Chinese team and Japanese team have started attacking Jishuka! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wahhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The audience’s attention that was focused on Pagma’s Descendant finally returned to the battlefield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They once again began to cheer for the players of their country.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, the United States representative, Hurent, was looking at the scoreboard with a perplexed expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Um~ what is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">South Korea - 113 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">United States- 77 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Brazil - 73 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Canada - 71 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">France - 69 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">China &nbsp;- 62 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Japan - 61 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">United Kingdom - 49 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Spain - 0 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the Korean team’s solo play.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had almost caught up with the Korean team’s score when Yura was attacked by the representatives of eight countries, but the sudden appearance of Pagma’s Descendant made his efforts useless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Destroying 11 top rankers alone and controlling the blades to handle the targets...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">During the Bairan battle, he had been ‘passable.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Really, isn’t it a foul to introduce a legendary class at this time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent made a frightened expression on the outside, but his eyes were calm.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He scratched his grey hair and his middle-aged brain started to spin quickly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The situation had changed due to a single influence.&nbsp;</span><span style="">How should he deal with it?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He worried about it before calling out his partner’s name.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Lauel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The young silver-haired man, who was watching Grid, replied with an expressionless face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent asked him,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Those golden blades, can you handle them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel’s gaze headed back towards the sky where Grid was.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He briefly observed the seven blades that were moving around 1.5 times faster than the target and explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sniping is possible if I can get within 30m of them. However, if those blades are made of the same material as the golden discs that appeared during the Bairan battle, they won’t be destroyed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay. Then we will give up on the gold medal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The United States was the world’s strongest power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As representatives of the United States, Hurent and Lauel were great.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As the number two person on the US team, Hurent was 8th on the unified rankings and had a hidden class. Meanwhile, Lauel was one of the Ten Rookies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They originally aimed to win, but they changed their target without faltering.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma's Descendant and Yura. It might be possible with just one of them, but it is folly to become enemies with both of them at the same time. Let’s leave both of them alone and focus on our own fight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They would aim for the silver medal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent made the decision and decided to defeat his rivals.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"First of all, our first target should be the Canadian team.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The United States, France, Brazil, China and Japan were the five teams in the forest. They were busy keeping each other in check.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The British team were near the Korean team, but their score was slowly rising because Natasha was handling the targets alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Spanish team? Med was the only survivor and he was confronting Regas. His score was also zero, so there was no need to worry about him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, the Canadian team was an eyesore.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were hidden halfway up a mountain and were persistently handling the targets. Thanks to their exquisite position, their speed of points acquisition was fast and no one was disturbing them. They were the obvious choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The French representatives and Chinese representatives on the right and left looked over here with frightened eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent laughed at them and spoke,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Three minutes. Just hold on for three minutes without me."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel’s face distorted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Hold on alone for three minutes? Won’t the other teams focus their attacks on me the moment you leave my side? I won’t even be able to last two minutes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No, you can hold on. If not, just endure for 2 minutes and 50 seconds. I will come back in that time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shouldn’t we go together?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No. Then the Canadian team can cooperate with other teams to isolate us. Then I am going~”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent spoke one-sidedly before jumping high in a manner that didn’t fit his large size. Like a martial artist, he ran along the trees and reached the mountain in a minute.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Have you come to be killed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Canadian representative ridiculed Hurent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were two of them, while Hurent was alone. Lauel was left alone and was being attacked by the representatives of other countries.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the end for the US.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You’re foolish, Hurent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After the Korean team that had Pagma’s Descendant and Yura, the United States had the next best power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now the Canadian team had an opportunity to defeat the United States.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent might be ranked 8th, but they were also in the top 30 rankings. The two of them believed they could defeat Hurent if they worked together.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Hurent isn’t a monster like Yura and Pagma’s Descendant. If he was a monster like them, he would’ve already smashed the other teams alone.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Canadian representatives thought so.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But in fact, Hurent was a monster.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was one of the seven rankers that Yura analyzed to be stronger than her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I have to hurry.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Hwaruruk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A red aura like fire blazed on both of Hurent’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was different from their information?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent had a rare hidden class called ‘Aura Master,’ and didn’t he originally deal with blue aura?&nbsp;</span><span style="">As they felt confused and wary, Hurent gave them new information.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Among the hidden classes, ‘growth’ types exist. My Aura Master was a rare class when I first acquired it, but now it’s been promoted to an epic class. My aura has become stronger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Bullshit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the first time they heard of growth type classes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Canadian team thought it was a bluff and attacked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The aura around both of Hurent’s hands formed swords.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will let you learn the glory of a future legendary class.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent spoke sincerely and swung his two aura blades.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The Canadian representatives struggled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They exchanged a few blows with Hurent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Hurent’s swordsmanship was much better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Canadian representatives started to be injured.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent’s aura blades completely ignored their defenses, so they suffered a 100% fixed damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Canadian representatives were shocked by their injuries, while Hurent’s aura blades moved like a whip.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk... Kuak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“From this angle, how...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A Canadian representative was pierced in the heart and was stunned after suffering massive damage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their survival was already in Hurent’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Your abilities are good, but... Somehow, the recent rankers are too weak in PvP. Is is because they are only focused on levelling up? You don’t know how to fight~”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent was unable to conceal his relaxed expression as he logged out the Canadian rankers. He checked the time while taking a potion and hit his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Damn, it has already been over three minutes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent operated aura around his lower half, allowing him to move at a tremendous speed and to quickly reach Lauel. Then he laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel, who he thought would already be dead, was relatively fine?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No wonder he’s called the strongest rookie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel glared sharply while Hurent was admiring him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It took you 4 minutes and 9 seconds.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Sorry, sorry~ The enemies were further than I thought.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The apologetic Hurent attacked the French and Chinese representatives who had attacked Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that moment, an arrow flew towards his heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent avoided it hitting his heart with breathtaking reflexes and expressed his disapproval. He pulled out the arrow and said,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I wanted to avoid a melee because of that woman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An archer was vulnerable in a one-on-one match. But it was a scary class when hidden behind allies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the first place, Jishuka was an outstanding talent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Well, she was my second goal. Cover me Lauel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent leapt in the direction of the Brazilian team.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘We can’t beat the US team if Jishuka is killed.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The other teams judged simultaneously and blocked him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there was one problem.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent dispersed aura around him. Then they transformed into aura spears and pierced the bodies of the enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk...! ‘Aura, is this its true power?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is the strength of a top 10 ranker...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Surprises kept appearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal, Chris, Bondre and Yura. Then there was Pagma's Descendant and Hurent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They showed strength that transcended common sense in this National Competition. Even if all participants were rankers, the level was different. It was to a point where they felt insignificant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent pierced through the disgruntled representatives and reached the Brazilian team.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Samuel blocked his way, but Samuel was the weakest one here. He couldn’t beat Hurent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eek!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Samuel was struck and fell down.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent had been hit with arrows several times, but he ignored them and narrowed the distance to Jishuka instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Isn’t this quite hard?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent explained to the sweaty Jishuka.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“It’s possible to operate my aura defensively. Anyway, it’s great. This is the first time I’ve become a hedgehog.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why don’t you experience your body being cut in half?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An unexpected voice was heard above his head?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent freaked out and moved.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The greatsword hit the place where he had been standing.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeok!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The ground shook like an earthquake had occurred.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid descended.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent noticed his mistake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right. Didn’t Pagma's Descendant belong to the Tzedakah Guild? Ah, I tried to touch someone I should’nt have.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You saw it right away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He might’ve never expressed it, but the Tzedakah Guild was very precious to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They noticed his value more quickly than anyone else, and they were people who respected and cared about him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He originally built a relationship with them because of money, but not anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was a relationship built up over half a year. They helped him in many ways.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid might laugh at some of them, but to him, they were his only friends.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How could he not protect his friends when he had enough strength?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was no different from his past friends who ignored him when he was in pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Yes, I will never do so.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At this moment, he realized why he wanted to enter the competition despite having to reveal his identity.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Sururuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s eyes changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The arrogance cleared from his eyes. The reasons he used to convince himself about why he participated in this competition was just a means to conceal his confusion, because he couldn’t understand his own psychology.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At this moment, his eyes were shining deeply and gently.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent witnessed the change in real time and was amazed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It feels like he has become another person.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, Jishuka’s eyes were shining from next to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘W-What? Why is he so good looking today?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka was always confident and didn’t pay attention to men.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her eyes couldn’t leave Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid moved her behind him and declared,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Watch me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ye... Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Duguen!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka looked at Grid’s wide back and turned red.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And right now, this situation was being broadcasted around the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Damn! This isn’t a drama!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Boo! Boo-!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The men around the world started to boo together.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pagma’s Descendant, Yura, wasn’t enough for him? He was aiming for Jishuka as well? Wasn’t he a very bad person?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Damn bastard!” </span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Rotten guy!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One man was gobbling up the hearts of two of the world’s most beautiful women.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was a lot of swearing around the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the same time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A young man in his 30’s was watching the competition on TV and stood up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then towards the Grid on TV... </span><i><span style="">Clap.</span></i> <i><span style="">Clap.</span></i><span style=""> A standing ovation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Plant flags all around you. Bravo...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This man had posters of Rebecca’s Daughters all over his house.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to Grid, the pope was killed and he became the first to receive a unique hidden class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was cheering for Grid from a distance.&nbsp;</span></p>
