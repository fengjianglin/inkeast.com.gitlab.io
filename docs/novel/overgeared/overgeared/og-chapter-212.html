 <p><span style="">Chapter 212</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The Eternal Kingdom and Gauss Kingdom didn’t have a good relationship. Over the past decades, there had been countless disputes and frequent bloodshed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Eternal Kingdom used the guide of being a neutral kingdom to monopolize some of the Gauss Kingdom’s products.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But the Gauss Kingdom wasn’t able to induce conflict with the Eternal Kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because the great magician Ashur was present at the border.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Ashur’s power was like a nuclear warhead in modern society, so it was enough to suppress any conflicts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Piaro was more than that.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"W-Who are you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the beginning, Earl Ashur had no interest in the beggar. No, he hadn’t even noticed. He only paid attention to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now the beggar was emitting an energy that could reverse the situation. At this moment, Earl Ashur’s five senses were only concentrated on the beggar. His original purpose of taking care of Grid disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Is this fear I’m feeling?’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Goosebumps covered his entire body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘There was a monster like this hiding in the kingdom?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Ashur gulped as Piaro asked for a duel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I want to experience the skills of one of the continent’s 10 great magicians.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I refuse. I have no reason to fight you, nor do I want to fight."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Ashur was adamant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Piaro just pulled out his sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was still obsessed with revenge, but he was also thirsty to fight against the strong. He was filled with a desire to become a sword saint. In particular, he was obsessed with Earl Ashur, because he had no experience fighting great magicians.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You have no choice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Crazy bastard!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was his only chance to get revenge on Grid, who stole Pagma’s Rare Book, as well as his son’s crush.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Once Grid arrived at Reidan and solidified his position as a duke, Earl Ashur would no longer be able to act against him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Later, he would be forced to bow before Duke Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But at this critical junction, someone interfered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Ashur’s anger soared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Who the hell are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Ashur knew about the group with the strange name of Overgeared who were working with Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there was no information about this beggar being part of Overgeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Where did this guy suddenly pop out from?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why are you with Grid? Are you his protector?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Protector? You’re mistaken. I don’t have anything to do with Duke Grid. This is my personal interest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the first place, did Grid need his protection?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was clear that this person called Ashur didn’t know much about Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Anyway, you aren’t Duke Grid’s opponent. It is better for you to compete against me. Right now, I am in an incomplete condition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This person!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Ashur sounded resentful towards Piaro, but his head was calm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I must be calm. I shouldn’t turn him into my enemy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The rumors might be exaggerated, but Grid’s strength that he showed in Reinhardt wasn’t negligible. Grid was praised as the kingdom’s hero, so Earl Ashur had to fight seriously.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After fighting with a much stronger opponent, could he take care of Grid?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is impossible.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The wisest choice was to let Grid go.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can’t miss the chance for revenge that will never come again.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Ashur made a decision.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘Create a space where Grid and I can fight.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In other words, create a three dimensional space. Space magic was different from other magic, so the consumption of magic power was very extreme.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even Earl Ashur had to consume half of his magic power to create a space ward.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he was willing to do this to handle Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Buy me some time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An earl was only supposed to have five knights, but Earl Ashur had dozens of knights as a commander of a fortified city.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He not only had great individual power, but his forces surpassed that of his title.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The elite knights got into formation at once.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">In that gap, Earl Ashur chanted a spell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Shake hands.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elite knights?&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were nothing compared to the knights of the Saharan Empire, the strongest nation on the continent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Furthermore, Piaro was the captain of the Red Knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It’s a waste of manpower."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s missing sword shot straight ahead.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A knight defended by raising his shield, but Piaro predicted this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Supreme Swordsmanship 3rd style.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was comparable with the skill of a martial artist.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro’s sword collided with the shield. The owner of the shield became a rag, while the other knights standing behind him spurted blood.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the moment when the knights that Earl Ashur was proud of were knocked down by a single blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Defense is useless?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The knights freaked out as it felt like they were hit by a tornado.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro leapt lightly. He didn’t give the knights time to reform their formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He really was like a god.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro defied the laws of gravity as he stood in the air and wielded his sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The vulnerable knights were unable to respond as the sword techniques fell from the sky. They couldn’t use the advantage of numbers to threaten Piaro, so they could only defend.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, Piaro’s sword accelerated so quickly that it was difficult to chase with the eyes, making it virtually impossible to defend.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jacks, the leader of the knights, swung his halberd and tried to counterattack in the gap when his men were being attacked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was difficult to hit, because Piaro rotated his body in the air at a dizzying speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This monster!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was unbelievable.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He completely avoided the large and wide attack of the halberd in the air? Was this old man a rumored assassin?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jacks continuously wielded his halberd.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The opponent avoided it until the end. Then there was an unforgettable experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The halberd started to be sucked into the rotating Piaro, as if it was attracted by a magnet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jacks tried to withstand it with all his strength, but it was useless. He let go of the halberd.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The halberd lost its master and shattered in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Keok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The falling fragments of the halberd aimed precisely at the knights on the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were wearing expensive armor, but whether it was coincidence of Piaro’s intentions, the fragments only aimed at the gaps on the armor. The armor was useless and the knights instantly collapsed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“M-Monster...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jacks couldn’t close his mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Ashur was even more surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘They couldn’t last?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One minute.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That was the amount of time required to generate the ward.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The 23 knights couldn’t withstand that short amount of time.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Cheok.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">At last, Piaro landed on the ground and stepped forward, ignoring Jacks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He neared Earl Ashur.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"In the end, we have to fight?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Ashur screamed at Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“That’s right! Okay! Let’s try it once!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It seemed he couldn’t avoid the fight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Ashur pulled out a staff that was 50 cm in length.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most magicians used orbs due to the versatility of the orb that could store magic. However, Earl Ashur was fast in magic casting, so he used a staff that amplified magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Haste!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One of the most important elements in a magic battle was speed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The opponent must hit before the magician finished casting a spell, and the magician must finish casting a spell before allowing an attack.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Ashur quickly increased his movement speed with Haste and widened the distance with Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He already finished casting the next spell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Orion’s Illusion!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an illusion technique.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Ashur created five clones of himself and once again opened up the distance while Piaro was searching for the real body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Next was debuff magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Soul Weakness!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s body became as sticky as oil and unpleasant magic power suppressed him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Disgusting."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s body lost its swiftness, but he bent like a bow and shot forward like a thunderbolt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He maximized his body’s ability to increase speed, offsetting the effect of the debuff.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Did he resist? My magic? No, it’s impossible.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Ashur’s eyes widened as he faced Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he tried to remain calm and finished casting the magic spell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ice Tornado!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a mixture of two A-grade spells with different attributes, and exerted more power than an A-grade spell.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was still significantly less powerful than S-grade magic, so why did he use it?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Even a great magician couldn’t cast S-grade spells in an instant. Using S-grade magic without precautionary measures against a person like Piaro was close to suicide.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s body froze as he approached Earl Ashur.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Ashur’s magic power exceeded common sense, so there was no one who wouldn’t be frozen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This guy won’t die like this.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Ashur believed that Piaro would recover within five seconds and started to chant a S-grade spell in that gap.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he underestimated Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Ashur was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">An intangible energy was felt from the frost and it shattered before even a few words could be chanted?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You’ve already recovered?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was too fast to use S-grade magic. He had to quickly accumulate more damage using A-grade spells.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He belatedly responded to Piaro’s sword that was flying.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Shield!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the manifestation of basic defensive magic that even beginners could use.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Great magic power.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro admired Ashur, who absorbed most of the damage with his shield. However, he continued to wield his sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Ashur stood firm. He tried to avoid as much damage as possible by relying on the previously activated Haste, while minimizing the actual damage using Shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Despite the continuous wounds he kept receiving, he used Shield while chanting S-grade magic in his head. Earl Ashur’s concentration was truly worthy of respect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro was swinging his sword when he suddenly felt alarmed. He detected a strong magic power and used the Supreme Swordsmanship 5th style, a defense technique.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Something intangible shot out of Earl Ashur the moment the spell was completed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Fluid Escape.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Fluid Escape was a spell that separated the soul and body of the caster for three seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The caster could control the soul that emerged from the body, while the body became immune to all damage.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Ashur’s body wasn’t damaged at all despite being hit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is the power of Fluid Escape!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Ashur’s soul passed through Piaro’s body and dealt damage in proportion to his magic power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Blood poured from Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I can’t tangle with this monster forever.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Ashur’s soul headed towards Grid, who was watching the battle with folded arms.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t give up on his original goal of aiming for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Die!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Ashur’s soul went through the grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 40,985 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have received catastrophic damage all at once, and your spirit can’t endure it.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was unprepared for the damage and suffered. The soul’s movement speed was so remarkable that the pavranium responded late. It was virtually impossible for a human to perceive it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Ashur’s soul returned to his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You deceived me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro suffered great damage to his pride and wielded his sword, but there was a powerful shockwave as soon as the soul returned to the body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro knew this fact, but he was confident that he could neutralize it with his blade.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, Earl Ashur’s magic power couldn’t be pierced by the sword.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“This...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro was pushed back by the shockwave. While he was upset, Earl Ashur aimed at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This is the end!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Finally, his grudge would be repaid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Ashur was determined to kill Grid while Grid was suffering from great damage and not in the right mindset.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But what was this?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid moved smoothly and Earl Ashur’s vision was covered with blue-white light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Ashur screamed at the unexpected attack.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He suffered cumulative damage when reciting the S-grade magic, so he easily fell down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid pointed Failure at him and said,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Beg me, Duke Grid, for your life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s sword damage was as powerful as Piaro’s. No, maybe even more than that.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Ashur thought it was ridiculous.</span></p>
