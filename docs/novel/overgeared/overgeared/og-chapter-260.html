 <p><span style="">Chapter 260</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is the place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t know exactly what type of treatment Piaro was receiving.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He vaguely thought that Piaro would be well respected and comfortable because he was so talented.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it turned out he was mistaken.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I never thought he would live in a place like this.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Farmer’s House]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A large-scale accommodation where widowers or single farmers lived together.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A great swordsman was staying in a shabby place like this?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was baffled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Isn’t Reidan wide? Why is it so hard to give him a house?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A great swordsman who was soon to become a sword saint. Wasn’t he a good mentor to everyone?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel explained to Grid, who was looking at them with rebuke in his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Piaro himself didn’t want to stay anywhere else. He said that he doesn’t deserve to live a comfortable life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s expression became dark.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s because of guilt.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He felt guilty for the family members and colleagues who died because he was falsely accused.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Maybe Piaro hadn’t slept well for a single day in the last few years.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘On the surface, he acts brightly.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Recently, Grid thought Piaro had overcome most of the wounds in his heart, but that was a misunderstanding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Duke Grid came...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That’s okay.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid restrained Lauel from shouting loudly and asked Asmophel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Are you ready?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Asmophel, who had been silent since arriving in Reidan, opened his mouth for the first time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I have been prepared to die for a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t talk about dying so easily.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reward of the hidden quest ‘Hidden Story’ was that Asmophel’s affinity would rise to the maximum along with Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid hoped that the named NPC, Asmophel, wouldn’t die.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the problem was that his survival depended on Piaro, not Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I am shaking.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid took a deep breath and entered the house.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Among the farmers who were exhausted by deep labor, the mediating Piaro was sitting alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moment that Piaro’s eyes opened and made contact with him, Grid instinctively realized.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He has become stronger.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro was originally strong.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid fought against Piaro and was confident of winning.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their skill with the sword might be different, but Grid believed he could defeat Piaro if he summoned Noe and Randy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But he was wrong.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s high insight warned that Piaro was a monster that couldn’t be predicted. He was completely different from five years ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'It’s more than Hell Gao’s presence...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Surely he didn’t achieve the status of sword saint while Grid was gone?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Duguen!</span></i> <i><span style="">Duguen!</span></i> <i><span style="">Duguen!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s heart started to thump wildly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He imagined Piaro becoming a sword saint and his excitement heightened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You have become stronger, Duke Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro stood up and faced Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His eyes gazed deeply into Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I want to fight.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid wanted to test his skills against the current Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was filled with an extreme fighting spirit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now wasn’t the time. The quest came first.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Did you kill Asmophel?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s eyes filled with deep emotions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a glimpse of his hatred towards Asmophel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I didn’t kill him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You didn’t?"&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wasn’t that weak, was he?&nbsp;</span><span style="">"What does this mean?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro made a confused expression and Grid pointed to the doorway.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I brought him to see you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The culprit of everything!&nbsp;</span><span style="">If that guy came here, Piaro would tear off his limbs and grind up his bones!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro rushed out of the room right away.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His face looked like a scary demon as he saw his enemy. Damian and all of the Overgeared members, except for Grid, were overpowered by his pressure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Asmophel!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Piaro.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A street where darkness descended.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The two friends who hadn’t reunited in three years, the distance between them was quickly narrowed down.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s hand grabbed Asmophel’s neck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Asmophel’s pale face twisted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it wasn't due to physical pain. It was because all his emotions burst out when he saw Piaro and he wanted to cry.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro, who had pulled out his sword, paused when he saw Asmophel’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You..! Why is a shameful person like you shedding tears?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m...sorry...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Despite his constricted neck, Asmophel succeeded in spitting out the words that he had cried many times over the years.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that moment, Piaro’s heart thumped.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He sensed something..&nbsp;</span><span style="">Maybe the atrocities committed by Asmophel were against his will.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, that wasn’t an important issue right now.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No matter the hidden story, Asmophel’s sin couldn’t be rationalized.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro shook off his curiosity and tightened his grip around Asmophel’s neck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Asmophel didn’t resist at all. He just repeated his apologies while being suffocated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had long been determined to atone with his death.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Kill me. Brutally tear me apart, burn my body and drop my filthy soul into hell. It doesn’t matter as long as your grudge is resolved.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro read Asmophel’s heart through his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had been friends with Asmophel for 25 years.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This meant that Piaro could read his mind through his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That’s why the sense of betrayal was more prevalent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This awful bastard!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The sword flew towards Asmophel’s neck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid saw this and turned his head away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I failed to get Asmophel.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Asmophel would die like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, it wasn’t a situation he could intervene in.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid judged this and was about to retreat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shit!”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro cursed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid turned his head again to see that the sword was stopped underneath Asmophel’s jaws.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Dammit!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro threw Asmophel away. Then he sat down.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His noble friend, Asmophel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A great man and friend until the day of betrayal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro was the person who knew him better than anyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Let me hear your story."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He wasn’t about to forgive Asmophel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had just been curious since a long time ago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why their relationship ended in such a catastrophic manner, Piaro wanted to know it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Asmophel didn’t say anything.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He knew there was no excuse for what he did.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro roughly grabbed his collar.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Say something!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had lost everything.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Ironically, the only friend left was this enemy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was sorry to his dead family and colleagues, but he wanted to hear the story.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Asmophel read Piaro’s feelings and painfully managed to open his mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He spoke the truth that he had buried in his heart for as long as he could.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s murderous expression became distressed as he heard the story.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The biggest victim of this story was Asmophel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Asmophel didn’t try to justify himself. He described himself as weak and the worst trash.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it wasn’t a position accepted by the listeners at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Asmophel tried to speak as calmly as possible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He constantly listed why he should die. He kept emphasizing his sins.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Piaro’s hatred towards Asmophel lessened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dammit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He slammed his fist into the ground after losing the target of his anger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Tears flowed down from Piaro’s eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was confused after knowing the whole truth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro couldn’t kill Asmophel. But it was right to kill Asmophel in order to appease the souls of Piaro’s family and colleagues.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As he was wondering what to do, Grid approached him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I know that it is hard to forgive. However, now that you have learned the truth, isn’t it foolish to kill him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Isn’t there a separate target for revenge?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Empress Marie.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The woman who took away the happiness of countless people due to her greed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kill her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid said bluntly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel had a headache.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Couldn’t you phrase it in a nicer way?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Become my person. Increase my strength with your abilities and become a weapon against the empress. I will be your sword and strike down your true enemy’ etc etc.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weren’t they great lines?&nbsp;</span><span style="">As Lauel was filled with regret, Piaro was forgiving Asmophel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I can no longer resent you after finding out that you were used in Marie’s wicked schemes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Asmophel wept. He could only repeat his apologies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the end Grid wanted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He smiled as he watched them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The hidden quest ‘Hidden Story’ has been completed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The relationship between Piaro and Asmophel has improved.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The affinity with the two people has risen to the maximum.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[If you recruit Piaro, there will be a 20% increase in the effect of the barracks and a 100% increase in the chance of getting a good harvest. In addition, you can create a ‘knights division.’]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[If you recruit Asmophel, the effect of the techniques research institutes will increase by 20%. In addition, you can create a ‘knights division.’]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Knights Division]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You can have a group of knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The buff effect will depend on the person appointed as the captain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Barracks Effect]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Affects the training speed of the soldiers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soldiers will gain new tactics as their level and abilities increase, and the number of weapons that can be used will increase as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Techniques Research Institute Effect]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Affects the speed at which soldiers and people gain skill experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The higher the skill level, the greater the variety of skills available to soldiers and also increases the power of the skill.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reward of the hidden quest was more than Grid imagined.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Amazing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a big hit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was an exorbitant level that couldn’t be easily expressed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid felt like he owned the world. He clenched his fists tightly as he felt a thrill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Then...’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now he had a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is the 100% increase in the chance of a good harvest?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What relationship did that have with a sword saint?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was puzzled until he suddenly recalled the notification window that appeared when he was in Titan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A legendary farmer has been born!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Perhaps...’&nbsp;</span><span style="">No. It couldn’t be.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘It can’t be.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He tried to shake off his sinister imagination.</span></p>
