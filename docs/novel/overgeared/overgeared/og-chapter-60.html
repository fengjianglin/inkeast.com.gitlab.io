 <p><span style="">Chapter 60</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">In the past few months, Earl Steim thoroughly searched and demolished almost all the Yatan Temples in the north.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Yatan Church was being punished for kidnapping a virgin to sacrifice her. But Earl Steim was especially fearful since his daughter Irene was kidnapped.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was fortunate that Irene was rescued, but he lost his most powerful shadow, Doran, in the process.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Steim had a fierce desire to get rid of the Yatan Church.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the elders of Yatan were distributed in great numbers across the continent. It wasn’t easy to kill those who bred endlessly like cockroaches.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was even a Yatan Temple on the outskirts of Winston.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"At the very least, there should be no more Yatan Temples in the north...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Irene’s hatred was just as strong as her father’s.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She couldn’t tolerate the existence of the Yatan Church in Winston.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She still hadn’t forgotten the terrible fear she felt after being abducted by the believers of Yatan. She shook at the thought of being a victim again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A few days ago, she sent out her army to destroy the Yatan Temple.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But due to the heavy resistance of the believers, the army returned without any achievements.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The number of casualties was 100 soldiers and three knights were seriously injured.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Irene proclaimed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Reorganize the temple expedition. This time, make sure the temple burns to ashes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Irene showed great ambition by investing more troops.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Irene touched the blue ring hanging from her necklace as she watched the troops.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Doran...I will get revenge for you who sacrificed your life for me.”</span></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">[Eighth Servant]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Difficulty Level: SS</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You have become one of the most blessed beings of God Yatan. Head to the northern part of the Eternal Kingdom and save the believers who are being suppressed there!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If you spread the greatness of God Yatan to the pagans in the north, you will be given the position of the Eighth Servant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Conditions: Earl Steim’s army is constantly attacking the Yatan Temple in the north. Rescue at least 300 stranded temple believers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Number of followers rescued so far: 0/300</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Reward: The position of ‘Eighth Servant.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Eighth Servant: The skill ‘Infinite Faith’ will be created. The skill ‘Teaching Doctrines’ will be generated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style=""> The skill ‘Divine Punishment’ will be generated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Failure: Level -5. Faith -1,000&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soldiers in the north of the Eternal Kingdom were known for their strength.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Obviously it would be a tough fight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Yura didn’t even hesitate to move towards Winston.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have to become stronger.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Not long ago, Yura faced Agnus who was 7th on the unified rankings. Then she realized the greatness of an epic class. She felt helpless, just like when she confronted the mysterious man with the ID of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now she had acquired an SS-grade quest. It was a golden opportunity.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura was determined to use this quest as a stepping stone towards the ultimate goal of being first in the rankings.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">I received a level 160 sword production method from Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the production method was quite burdensome. Based on the list of ingredients required, it would cost 950 gold to make this sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Well... it can’t be helped.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I currently had 6,710 gold.&nbsp;</span><span style="">With this money, I could only make seven swords.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In addition, the number of swords I could make in a week was just seven.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Seven. Isn’t it good that everything adds up to seven?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In South Korea, the number seven was a symbol of good luck!&nbsp;</span><span style="">I trusted the lucky number.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I’ll do it in one go~! An epic item is coming! Hehehehehe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was caught up in the pleasant mood and hummed while spending 20 hours on the sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And the completed work...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Durable Longsword]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Normal</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 250/250 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 200</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A sword made by a craftsman with great skill and potential but lacking in experience and reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It won’t be easily damaged after being tempered for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 160 or higher. More than 950 strength. Intermediate Sword Mastery.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 600&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Who said that seven was a lucky number? Urgh, I want to kill them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One attempt flew away.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was normal to feel like cursing the system. However, the value of the materials couldn’t be returned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I barely moved my legs that were trembling from anger and approached Khan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"How much will this sell for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan looked at the sword for a long time before replying cautiously.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“It is around 800 gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I almost grabbed Khan’s collar.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The materials I used were worth 950 gold, but the value was only 800 gold?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then what was this?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"An equipment like this with the original conditions won’t trade well. This is why...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan elaborated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Here was a brief summary:</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A level 160 item would have a better basic performance than a level 120 item. Normal rated items had no options, while rare items had a small option attached. Depending on how the options were set up, a level 120 rare item often outperformed a normal level 160 item. Therefore, the prices of the two items didn’t vary greatly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">People with money were more likely to buy the level 120 rare item than the level 160 normal item.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"In other words, get rid of the normal items...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan comforted me.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"But your equipment is good even with a low rating, so you won’t see a big loss. Please be comforted by that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Comfort... Hah, this is really messed up.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the future, I could make six more swords.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Based on the two-thirds probability of getting an epic item, I had a chance to clear the quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Damn, this time it will surely work!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I became extremely focused. Then I tried to make the best possible sword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">20 hours later.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The second sword was complete.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Durable Longsword]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Normal</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 250/250 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 200</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A sword made by a craftsman with great skill and potential, but lacking in experience and reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It won’t be easily damaged after being tempered for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 160 or higher. More than 950 strength. Intermediate Sword Mastery.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 600&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hey, this #@!$%~! The operators @#$:) Bastards! They are manipulating this <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f9ddd8b9">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>#! No, why are you doing this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan brought me a cup of warm tea.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Have strength. Trials will come to everyone. If you overcome this trial...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ah, don’t talk to me! I am too annoyed right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I ran out of Khan’s smithy and yelled towards the sky,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“These damn operators! If you manipulated the probabilities, I will accuse you to the Consumer Rights Center! You #<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="537713">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>!#!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I used the best materials. I did my best during the production.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If the operators had a minimum of conscience, a normal result wouldn’t come out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I believed so and started making the third sword.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">I barely slept for the past few days as I kept hammering. &nbsp;My shoulders were tired by I didn’t stop hammering.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a matter of pride.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I had the title of the legendary blacksmith, so I couldn’t keep making normal rated items. I would escape the manipulations of the operators and create an epic item.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">... Not long ago, my goal was to create a unique or legendary item, but now, I was only aiming for epic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But what could I do? Reality wasn’t kind so I had to settle for epic items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was dinner time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I had no appetite. I didn’t know if the rice entered my mouth or my nose.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My mother was worried about me and asked with a bemused expression.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Hey Youngwoo, did something bad happen? I worked on those braised short ribs for a long time, so why are you sucking on bone for five minutes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"A pathetic person like me isn’t qualified to eat meat...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One and a half days had passed in reality, while 6 days passed in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the meantime, I made six swords and the result was three normal, one rare and two epic swords.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now I could make one more sword before the time limit was over, but I only had two epic rated items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I’m ruined... Ruined...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">When investing 20 hours to create an item, the probability of making an epic item was close to one third.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In other words, the possibility of my remaining sword being an epic item was very low.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My quest ‘Business with the Administrator’ would soon be destroyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have a legendary class but I can’t even make an epic item... I am a truly pathetic person who doesn’t deserve food.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The frustrated Sehee placed a braised rib on top of my rice bowl.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What’s new? Oppa, haven’t you always been pathetic? Why do you need to look so weak now? I don’t know what type of adversity Oppa is going through these days, but the only good thing about you is that you don’t know how to give up. Right? When Oppa was in 6th grade in elementary school, you were able to memorize everyone from the 1st grade to 6th grade, so don’t be frustrated this time and be patient. Oppa will surely be able to overcome these difficulties.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"S-Sehee... did you eat something bad?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">I got goose bumps at the words that Sehee normally didn’t say and asked my mother,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Mother, maybe there’s something wrong with the braised ribs. Are these beef short ribs? Is this beef from cows with the mad cow disease?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“These are pork ribs!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ppak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee picked up the piece of rib she gave me and threw it at me.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The rib slid down the side of my face as I seriously wondered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why was I being hit every time I sat down for a meal? Why was I being treated worse than a dog by my family members?</span></p>
