 <p><span style="">Chapter 179</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Players were aware of other players.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent was aware that there were six people stronger than him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Those six were the 1st ranked Kraugel, 2nd ranked Zibal, 3rd ranked Chris, 7th ranked Agnus, 11th ranked Bondre, and 14th ranked Hao.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Except for them, there were no players who could beat Hurent in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'And I will soon go beyond those six people.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was the only one.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was his goal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would eventually get the results he intended.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Class: Aura Master.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Weapons are meaningless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">*You can control ‘Aura.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The minimum qualifications to become a sword saint have been achieved.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Title - Sword Saint Candidate - Stage 1 (Transcendent)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* All stats will become 1.3 times greater.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Quickly detect the target’s weakness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* There is a high probability of predicting the target’s movements.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* ‘Super Sensitivity’ will be opened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Aura]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Epic (Red)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A type of energy that can be controlled. Aura is infinite and always present.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The shape, size and characteristics will depend on the caster’s inclination.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The color of the aura will change according to the rating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The higher the rating, the higher the effectiveness of the aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The higher the rating, the greater the size of the aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Aura can’t be separated from the caster.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* You can raise the aura rating through training.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Super Sensitivity Lv. 1 (36.4%)]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">All senses will become transcended.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lv. 1 - Telepathy: You can predict 100% of all your target’s behavior within 10m.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* This effect will last for six seconds and will continue for two seconds after the effect has ended.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Mana consumption: All of your current mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 1 hour.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘You aren’t my opponent.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was able to see all of his target’s movements, despite only being at a beginner level.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pagma?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘How stupid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">According to legend, Pagma was the strongest swordsman.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But that was only when Muller was absent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pagma was named the strongest swordsman after Muller’s death.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wasn’t Pagma a blacksmith in the first place?&nbsp;</span><span style="">How could a blacksmith who swung his sword as a hobby compare to a sword saint?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Pagma’s Descendant is insignificant compared to a sword saint.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Suuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent manifested aura at his fingertips. Then he released it at a huge tree exactly 5m ahead of him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The giant tree was cut as soon as the aura touched it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It dealt 4,600 fixed damage, could be released up to 5m, and the shape could freely transform.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He also had ‘Super Sensitivity,’ which allowed him to sense the enemy’s movements.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It could be said that this was his strongest skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Aura Master.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The weakness was that he didn’t have powerful attack skills, but that weakness could be overcome by raising his aura rating.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No matter how he looked at it, Aura Master was a perfect combat class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t possible to compare it to Pagma's Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“30 seconds...? Hahat~!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was arrogant just because he had the first legendary class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent laughed as he recalled Grid’s 30 second logout remark.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Newbie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t know.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t understand his subject.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Prepare to be embarrassed~”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The whole world would be paying attention to the PvP competition held in a while.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent was determined to shatter Grid in front of the millions of people watching.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Legend?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wouldn’t even give Grid a chance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was nothing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At this moment, Hurent was only wary of Chris and Bondre, who were on the list of PvP participants.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will go beyond those two people today.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent wasn’t even looking at Grid.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">He just had a friendly co-worker relationship with Yura and Jishuka right?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Where did he go with the drunken women two days ago?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reporters flocked like vultures and bombarded Youngwoo with questions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo barely managed to escape them and sighed as he reached the waiting room.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Wow, why are they so terrible? I thought I was going to die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn't a joke.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Among the reporters, the male ones looked like they wanted to commit murder.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura and Jishuka. They cursed and hated Youngwoo for having a scandal with both of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura handed a tournament table to the pale Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There are a total of 32 PvP participants. The matches were drawn through a fair lottery.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The number of participants is surprisingly small.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s because individuals are limited to three events. The players prioritize events where they can get gold medals, so the 32 players participating in the PvP are all renowned top rankers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo looked at the table.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he found his ID and was surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Is this really true?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura replied with a worried expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Honestly, I’m really surprised. It’s a match between you and Hurent in the round of 32. It’s also the opening match. Who would’ve imagined?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The big match of the PvP was the confrontation between Grid and Hurent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">People around the world were only paying attention to the confrontation between the two. They wondered how big the match would be.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The public became boisterous.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The round with 32 participants.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It seemed like a miracle that the confrontation between Grid and Hurent was the opening match.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The confrontation was now right around the corner.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Who would be the winner?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid, who said he would logout his opponent in 30 seconds? Or would he be disgraced?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most Koreans wanted Grid to win, while the foreigners were predicting Grid’s defeat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The amount bet on the match was astronomical, and the dividend rate for Grid was really high.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hurent! Hurent! Hurent!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid! Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hurent! Hurent! Hurent!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The atmosphere of the stadium was remarkable.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The voices cheering for Hurent were way louder than those cheering for Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Some people in the crowd were even booing Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura was worried that Grid’s morale would be lowered by the one-sided cheering.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Youngwoo wasn’t upset at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The PvP competition will be held in 20 minutes. All participants should go to the capsule room. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The sound of the guide was heard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo got up from his seat and reassured Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"First of all, I don’t have much experience with people cheering me on.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Conversely, he was familiar with mockery.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"The cheering atmosphere has no effect on me. Hurent? I will shatter him in 30 seconds and win the gold medal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Two days ago, Yura had been worried after seeing Hurent’s one sided treatment of Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She thought the walls of the world were too high for Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But not anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She just trusted him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Take care.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The most beautiful smile was aimed at Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Pearl Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the past, it was an island used by the knight academy of the Bonkost Principality.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The giant island that once flourished had now become deserted and desolate.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The glory of the past couldn’t be found in the ‘Lion’s Castle’ standing at the center of the island.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">All the facilities, including the walls, were destroyed, and the garden devastated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There seemed to be ghosts hiding behind the broken windows of the castle.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The long forgotten place shrouded in spectacular views was shown on the massive screens set up in Olympic Station.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the stage of the duel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The PvP tournament is heating up the last day of the National Competition! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Waaaaahhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The hundreds of thousands of spectators cheered as the commentator shouted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t just them. The viewers all over the world were excited as well.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Who was the strongest person in the world?&nbsp;</span><span style="">How brilliant was their control and skills?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel and Zibal might not be participating, but there would surely be plenty to see.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It came!</span></i> <i><span style="">Chicken and beer!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Two chickens.</span></i> <i><span style="">If 32 people are participating, one chicken won’t be enough.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">If each match is 10 minutes, the PvP will last at least a few hours.</span></i> <i><span style="">I have to binge drink today. </span></i><span style="">ㅋ</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It’s nonsense.</span></i> <i><span style="">Grid will be knocked out in 30 seconds.</span></i> <i><span style="">The match will finish before the chicken arrives.</span></i><span style=""> ㅇㄱㄹㅇ ㅂㅂㅂㄱ</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-ㅇㅇㅇ </span><i><span style="">Grid is scheduled to win.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">- Wow ㅋㅋ Do you really mean that?</span></i> <i><span style="">You believe Grid’s bluff? </span></i><span style="">;;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">He will logout Hurent in 30 seconds?</span></i> <i><span style="">Crazyㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ He was defeated by Hurent in the target processing. ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Guys.</span></i> <i><span style="">If you are South Korean, then you should support our fellow Korean.</span></i> <i><span style="">Cheer for Grid-nim.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">That's right.</span></i> <i><span style="">I am anti-Grid because of the matter with Yura and Jishuka.</span></i> <i><span style="">But love is a separate, personal matter.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-Aye!</span></i> <i><span style="">Don’t forget that Grid-nim gave our country a gold medal.</span></i> <i><span style="">I am very thankful.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">No, what </span></i><span style="">ㅡ_ㅡ^ </span><i><span style="">a gold medal doesn’t matter.</span></i> <i><span style="">What good is it for us if he wins a gold medal?</span></i> <i><span style="">Why should we be thankful? ㅡ_ㅡㅋ</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-ㅋㅋ </span><i><span style="">I shudder every time I see Grid being called a hero on TV.</span></i> <i><span style="">How is he a hero just because he won one gold medal? ㅋㅋ</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Isn’t it natural to praise athletes who win a gold medal for their country?</span></i> <i><span style="">Would you say such things about Olympic athletes?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Well anyway, Grid doesn’t matter.</span></i> <i><span style="">In a few minutes, he’ll be logged out by Hurent.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">You scum...</span></i> <i><span style="">I bet 4 million won on Grid...</span></i> <i><span style="">My whole fortune...</span></i> <i><span style="">Now I’m dying of tension.</span></i> <i><span style="">I might shit out blood in the morning...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Oh my god ;; you bet on Grid? ㅋㅋㅋㅋ</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-Wow ㅋㅋ 4 million won on Grid? ㅋㅋㅋ Isn’t Hurent certain to win? ㅋㅋㅋ You’re just throwing your money into the trash.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">But the dividend rate is 3.2. If Grid wins, that 4 million won will triple.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-That only matters if he wins...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Even on the Korean internet sites, there weren’t many people who thought Grid would win.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Surprisingly, many netizens thought that Grid would be the first to be eliminated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">And.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The players are entering! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The broken Lion Castle.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In a desolate garden, a black-haired Asian man and brown-haired Westerner appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the moment when Grid and Hurent met, after attracting worldwide attention for the last three days.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As hundreds of millions of people watched, they finally clashed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Now I will announce the opening of the PvP match! It has started! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Waaahhhhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The shouts of the crowd were vividly transmitted through the TV.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Will Grid win as the Korean people wish? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The commentator relayed in a loud voice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo’s family gulped in front of the TV.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were earnestly praying for their son and brother to win.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">And Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, Grid started his sword dance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Oh my~ you are using your slow paced skill again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent clicked his tongue and attacked Grid in the gap exposed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Syuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The golden blades flew to protect Grid, but Hurent’s ability to control aura was very delicate.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent was already aware of the presence of the golden blades and responded calmly, accurately avoiding the wall formed by the blades to hit Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 4,600 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Good, good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He would trample on Grid step by step.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He knew the skills Grid possessed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The range of Kill, Link and Wave wasn’t that far, so they wouldn’t be a threat as long as he kept an appropriate distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The ranged skill Transcended Link was somewhat annoying, but it had a long cooldown time of at least 15 minutes. Hurent thought he would be able to withstand one bombardment if he focused his aura on defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Restraint.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a completely different skill that wasn’t shown in Bairan or the target processing event.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent paled as he realized it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was astonished to see the notification window in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have been overwhelmed by the enemy’s spirit. Your actions are constrained for three seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is this...!?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His body was stiff and hard to control properly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid approached from 5m away and his body instinctively retreated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he couldn’t open up a distance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid took a few steps in the amount of time it took for Hurent to take one step back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Two seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid narrowed the distance in an instant and unfolded a new sword dance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent focused all his aura on defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your defense has increased by 150%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A shield that will absorb 5,000 damage has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can endure it once...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent’s thoughts didn’t last long.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have absorbed 5,000 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 68,300 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have died.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On various Internet portal sites, the real time search queries were updated to ‘5 seconds.’</span></p>
