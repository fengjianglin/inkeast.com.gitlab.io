 <p><span style="">Chapter 52</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Perhaps I was too stupid to understand the contents of the letter? It was like how I couldn’t understand a barking dog. “Where is this person now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan carefully replied,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Earl Steim has sentenced him to 10 years in prison.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It &nbsp;was ridiculous.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No, why? Wasn’t Rabbit the one who helped Winston?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"He is certainly a hero who saved Winston, but Winston was in this crisis in the first place due to the Mero Company. He eventually realized his sins, but the earl thinks it’s too unreasonable to completely wash away his sins.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dammit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shit... What is this...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Didn’t Rabbit promise to make me rich? But now he was trapped in prison? Stupid bastard!&nbsp;</span><span style="">He said he would do something good for me, but it ended up like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan patted my shoulder as I was feeling frustrated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I understand the sadness of seeing the person who rescued you now trapped in jail, but cheer up. You have your life. Don’t be so frustrated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was he saying?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No... I don’t care about Rabbit right now... Oh, by the way, I heard that you were also arrested after me? You didn’t get hurt, did you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Why are you worried about me when you were framed and insulted? Your heart is truly as wide as the sea. Ugh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The smiling man was once again in tears.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I actually heard the story. You were surrounded by knights, and didn’t you open your mouth to protect me? Once again, I am deeply moved by you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was he referring to the incident in the interrogation room?&nbsp;</span><span style="">I tried to give up Khan as the one who commissioned Huroi, but I couldn’t answer because my mouth was gagged.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I laughed awkwardly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Well... I could’t sell you out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Sob... even if you were tortured... Grid! I believe that I can entrust it to you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This smithy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“... Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What did he mean by the smithy?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Perhaps?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ah, I must’ve heard wrong. I shouldn’t count my chickens before they were hatched.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As I felt doubts, Khan smiled benignly and said,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"You disguised yourself as my successor to defend this smithy and compete with the Mero Company. From then on, I have already thought of you as my successor. This smithy will be yours in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“... No way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were some users who received a position from a NPC. But I’d never heard of a user becoming the successor of a business.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Maybe I was the first.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You aren’t joking?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Haha, have I ever said anything false before? As you know, I don’t have a successor. Very soon, I will become too old to work... then this smithy will lose its owner and be neglected. I don’t want this smithy that has been in my family for generations to disappear. I sincerely want you to take over this smithy. You are Pagma’s Descendant and have a great personality, so my ancestors will be delighted. Also, my son is dead...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan’s face darkened the moment he brought out the story of his dead son.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He stimulated a person’s emotions so I asked him to make sure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t just say it with words. Write a contract! Then I will believe you and will work hard for the sake of this smithy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After a while, I received a contract from Khan about the smithy ownership transfer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then a notification window popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have obtained the position ‘ Smithy’s Successor.’]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Smithy’s Successor]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You will have the same status as the owner in Khan’s Smithy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This isn’t a dream, right?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">I pinched myself as hard as I could.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“It hurts...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I used so much strength that my cheek was tingling.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t a dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This definitely isn’t a dream! It’s real. Hah...! Hahahat! Puhahaha! Yes! Oh yes! Ye~!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I couldn’t suppress my joy at the thought of this large two-storey smithy someday becoming mine.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan looked at me smiling like crazy and declared,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I’m glad that you’re so happy. You can definitely lead this smithy well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Of course! Now! Let’s work. We will make great items and tell people how amazing our smithy is!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh. Isn’t this good? You’re really motivated!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I would receive recognition from my parents from my work at the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I devoted myself to making items for the next few days.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From morning to afternoon, I headed to the labor jobs. Then from night until dawn, I connected to Satisfy and made items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I am doing labor again... It seems I am unable to escape from the quagmire of labor...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was only sleeping for four hours a day due to excessive motivation. I was tired, but I could endure it due to the money, stats and skill experience accumulated.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The Tzedakah Guild only had 17 members, but they were composed of top rankers and a few elites!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Among the 17 people, Jishuka was the guild leader and she developed the habit of checking the auction house every day.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because she was addicted to the performance of the Special Jaffa Arrows, which she bought around two months ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Special Jaffa Arrows had the best attack power among the existing arrows.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Special Jaffa Arrows were twice as powerful as general Jaffa Arrows, and had a chance of ignoring the enemy’s defense completely.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka had been thrilled as she felt the excellent performance and destructive power of the Special Jaffa Arrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But after that first day, the Special Jaffa Arrows never appeared in the auction house again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Usually blacksmiths would create thousands of arrows.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In other words, it was likely that thousands of the Special Jaffa Arrows existed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the creator of the Special Jaffa Arrows only offered up 99 at the auction.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It can’t be... has another guild already found the blacksmith?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka became nervous.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If another guild got their hands on the blacksmith and monopolized the items, Jishuka and her guild members would be cut off.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s Jishuka.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Wow, her body looks even more amazing up close.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shall I give it a try?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hey you. You will have a terrible experience.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka was the focus of people’s attention as usual.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The tanned skin and sensual body made the hearts of men pound.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Many males were drawn to her sharp eyes and full lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka tried to ignore them, but there was a limit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The users started to gather after hearing that Jishuka was at the auction house, so it wasn’t long before the auction house reached the limit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Can you get out of the way?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The half moon eyes drew in the men.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, her heavy-handed tone caused an invisible wall around her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, the men couldn’t endure it anymore and gave way.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After leaving the people at the auction house behind, Jishuka summoned a hologram keyboard.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then she declared in the guild chat window.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{If you don’t find the blacksmith within this month, you will all enter hell training.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Ohh! I welcome hell training!}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Regas! Don’t talk nonsense! It is called hell training for a reason.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Captain, to be honest, it is almost impossible to find a person in Satisfy with so little clues. Do you know how many users there are in Satisfy?}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{It can’t happen.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{...Ohh...I agree...}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The guild members started complaining. Jishuka told them seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{A small guild of elites like us must be stronger than others in order to accurately show our value. We need the blacksmith to become stronger. So please find them.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Understood. I will be sure to find the blacksmith.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Hey! We should make a bet. 100 gold from each person for the one who finds them first!}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{What? I will make 1,600 gold if I win? Okay, I will find them!}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka was always tenacious. She truly was a steely woman. It was extremely rare for her to ‘ask’ something from them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, the guild members were able to realize the urgency of the situation and became motivated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Only Regas had a complaint.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{I want to train...}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Where are you? ^^}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka used emoticons!&nbsp;</span><span style="">The guild members saw it and thought simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Captain is angry.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Regas is dead.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that time, there was a notice in the guild’s chat window.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Vantner has logged in.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the appearance of Vantner, who finally took the top spot in the guardian knight rankings five days ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Welcome Vantner.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Hey, why were you sleeping for seven hours? Aren’t you being too lazy? Your ranking will be taken away.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{I saw something interesting on the Internet. I was a little late because I was looking for articles related to the incident. Have you heard of a place called Winston?}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{A village in the north of the Eternal Kingdom?}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Ah~ that place? I stopped by it once on my way to Bairan Village. Why? What's going on?}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{There was an item creation game that took place there. It was said that one of the competitors created an epic rated dagger in three hours.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{A user, not an NPC?}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Yes.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{That person!}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{The blacksmith finally appeared!}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{We’ve got you!}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The guild members became excited.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A blacksmith who could create an epic rated item in just three hours wasn’t common.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even the number one blacksmith, Panmir wasn’t capable of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka commanded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Everyone head to Winston! From now on, we will focus our investigation in Winston!}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Understood!}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{If it’s Winston... It will take around three days for me to get there.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{I will take a week.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{...The person who arrives the latest should be prepared. And Regas, if you don’t arrive in half a day then I really will kill you ^^}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{C-Captain! I’m in the Burns Principality right now! It will take me two days to get to Winston on horseback!}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Don’t rely on a horse and run there directly! Then won’t you somehow arrive in a day?}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{O-Ohhh! Can I arrive in half a day?}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{I will kill you if you don’t arrive in half a day.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{What should I do?}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Tzedakah Guild started to gather in Winston.</span></p>
