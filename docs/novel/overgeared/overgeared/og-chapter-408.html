 <p><span style="">Chapter 408</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? 9 hours?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">9 hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the time it took to travel from South Korea to Paris, France. This was even non-stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We aren’t riding a boat. Why does a plane ride take so long?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“France is at the western end of Europe. It only takes 9 hours because this is a new passenger plane. It takes around 12 hours when flying on an older passenger plane.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The road to Incheon International Airport.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo felt uncomfortable as he rode in a car with Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Isn’t 9 hours 27 hours in Satisfy time?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">27 hours was a long time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Based on his level 307, hunting for 27 hours was enough to raise his experience gauge by 1.5%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">What about blacksmithing?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">He could use that time to complete Noe and Randy’s items. Maybe he could even enjoy a hot love with Irene.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had to waste that time stuck on a plane?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was especially painful for Youngwoo, who used time and effort to cover his lacking talents and skills. It was enough to make him tremble.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Anyway, I can just go online from home. Why do I need to gather in Paris?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Shin Youngwoo muttered from the passenger seat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword couldn’t concentrate on driving and turned on the self-driving capabilities of the vehicle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What don’t you like? Tell me what it is that makes you uncomfortable. I’ll resolve it for you! Ah, are you worried there won’t be any kimchi in Paris? Don’t worry! I wrote out a list of Korean marts and Korean restaurants. If you want, I can even cook kimchi stew in front of the Eiffel Tower!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo was reminded that Peak Sword was someone who grabbed foreigners on the street and asked “Do you know kimchi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...No, please don’t do that. I just don’t like that I can’t play the game while stuck on the plane for 9 hours.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah, I see.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword understood Youngwoo’s feelings and smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“You’re really diligent. Then should we use Yura’s private plane?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Private plane?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I heard it in the meeting yesterday. There are Satisfy capsules on Yura’s private plane, so if you want to play Satisfy while travelling to France, you can use Yura’s private plane."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The fact that she had a private plane was surprising, and there was also a Satisfy capsule on it?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an unrealistic world for Youngwoo, despite being the owner of a 10 billion won building that would be completed in the near future.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘How rich is she?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura’s astronomical strength was shocking.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo was at a loss for words as Peak Sword asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"How about it? Do you want to take Yura’s private plane?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was no need to think.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay, I’ll contact her. Yura will be very happy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo didn’t question why Yura would be happy, because his head was filled with the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was looking forward to it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wanted to show his worth to the people of the world who kept denying him.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">"Welcome."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a long flight to France.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura was originally dressed comfortably, but she changed once she heard the news that Youngwoo was coming.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her short skirt caught Youngwoo’s attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Really pretty.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Like everyone else, Youngwoo couldn’t help feeling admiration every time he met Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hers was a timeless beauty that transcended the concept of race, causing everything in her surroundings to fade away.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka was the only one who didn’t lose to Yura when it came to beauty.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'No, Marie Rose as well.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Marie Rose combined Yura’s simple and intelligent charm with Jishuka’s provocative beauty.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She might be an NPC, but he couldn’t understand how she could be so perfectly beautiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There is an effect.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura saw that Youngwoo was staring at her and felt delight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She thought it was correct to choose clothing that suited Youngwoo’s taste.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But that joy was brief.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Where is the capsule?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura felt ashamed as Youngwoo looked at her chest for a moment before asking.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo’s taste was firm.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid sighed with relief as he connected to Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hah, I’m nervous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He knew that Yura was pretty from the moment he saw her on TV.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he never saw her wearing these types of clothes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He felt a new charm from the always neat Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Her body is so pretty that my ideal type might change.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t because of indifference that Grid ran straight into the capsule without having a long conversation with Yura. Rather, he was too conscious.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was too pretty. He couldn’t face her head on.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura was a burden for Grid, who still lacked resistance to ‘real women.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is this? Yura wouldn’t be interested in me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura always showed a positive attitude, but it was a type of partnership rather than a crush. He couldn’t misunderstand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why would a woman like that like me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura’s perfect man had to be smart, sweet, handsome, rich, and have a good family.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As Grid was recognizing Yura as part of a different world, Peak Sword sent a whisper to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Did you read the article that was announced a month ago?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Article?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It said that due to reducing the number of participants for each country, the chances of winning medals will increase.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I don’t think I saw the article since I was in the Behen Archipelago...</span></i> <i><span style="">In what way?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">The 1st National Competition had a maximum of three events for one person, regardless of individual or team events. Meanwhile, the 2nd Competition doesn’t have a limit on the number of team events.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-Team?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Boss raid, target match, and siege.</span></i> <i><span style="">The rules of these three events have been changed in order to allow all participants from all countries to participate.</span></i> <i><span style="">That’s why the participants gathered together for an operational meeting yesterday.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Hoh.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A smile appeared on Grid’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">If I win three gold medals individually and three gold medals in the team events, does this mean that South Korea can win the National Competition?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It’s possible.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-But it isn’t realistic.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Despite the presence of Grid, Yura, and Peak Sword, South Korea was classified as weak because the level of the other participants was poor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In addition, unlike Grid, Peak Sword was greatly weakened by this patch.&nbsp;</span><span style="">South Korea was forced to be weak in team events.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Unfortunately, in the siege and target match, there’s no way for us to win the gold meal.</span></i> <i><span style="">But the boss raid is different.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword had been watching Grid all the time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s harsh raid experience was much more than common users, so Peak Sword placed hope there.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I believe that if we support you well during the raid, we can get a gold medal.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid couldn’t understand it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I don’t know the siege rules, but why not the target match?</span></i> <i><span style="">Can’t we get a gold medal in the target match?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura was a long distance damage dealer with her magic gun, while Grid could release Magic Missile with the God Hands.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid judged that if the two people combined powers, they would be able to play an overwhelming role in the target match.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Peak Sword thought differently.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I don’t have the ability to protect you and Yura from the other participants.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Hrmm.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I’m sorry to be holding onto your ankles.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t like Peak Sword’s attitude.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Who was Peak Sword?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He might be ridiculous, but Peak Sword was a proud Korean.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was disturbing to see him shrink back like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Is the damage from the patch that big?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid spoke in a serious voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword replied honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It’s the concept of my class.</span></i> <i><span style="">My base damage is very high compared to other combat classes, but the delay after an attack is big.</span></i> <i><span style="">If I can’t deal a fatal blow with one strike, it will be counterattacked and I will be defeated. If my damage is halved in the National Competition...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">He stopped talking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Umm...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid thought for a long time before asking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Is the delay after an attack affected by the attack speed?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">The delay is reduced if my attack speed is high.</span></i> <i><span style="">But the minimum length of a weapon that I can equip is 1 meter and 50 centimeters, and long swords have a limit on their attack speed.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">‘That’s prejudice.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the past, Grid had made the Ideal Dagger when he first faced Euphemina in the blacksmith match.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a weapon with an excellent buff that raised his agility and attack speed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If the options of the Ideal Dagger could be reproduced with a sword, it would be worth using as one of his flagship weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, it wasn’t possible to maximize the effect if he gave the option of the Ideal Dagger to a heavy sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I thought of a longsword.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid wasn’t in a hurry to make it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had concentrated on producing armor instead of the National Competition was because he was fully satisfied with the weapons he was currently using.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, Iyarugt’s experience was at 83%, so it was likely that it would grow to a legendary level during the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">PvP weapon experience gain was similar to PvE experience gain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I don’t think I will lack attack power, because I also have Item Combination.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But wouldn’t it be better to be properly prepared?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He should speed up the production of the Ideal Long Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I will be working on a sword until we get to Paris.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Sword?</span></i> <i><span style="">F-For me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Don’t get me wrong. It isn’t just for you.</span></i> <i><span style="">Now get the materials I need.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yes, I understand!</span></i> <i><span style="">I will acquire them for you now!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Just like Grid upgraded his items before the National Competition, the members of Overgeared also wanted to upgrade their items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But they didn’t ask Grid because they were likely to be his enemies in the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid also knew this fact, but Peak Sword was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At the very least, he would be an ally in the team event.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I should increase the power of the same side.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">People who played the game knew this feeling.</span></p>
