 <p><span style="">Chapter 312</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Following the Magic Missile test, Grid headed to Khan’s smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to Grid, Khan was able to achieve Advanced Blacksmithing level 7.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a more capable blacksmith than he was in Winston.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He supervised and taught over 80 young blacksmiths, while producing the supplies that Rabbit and the army commissioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Don’t you look younger?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s face brightened after not seeing Khan for a long time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan looked much better than before.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Interacting with young people, isn’t it natural to become younger and healthier? This is all due to you. I’m so happy that I could meet you at the end of my life and enjoy such blessings.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I'm happy that you’re happy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had known Khan since the days when he was invisible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s affection for Khan was endless, and Khan was the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"For the rest of my life, I will always work hard for you. I will raise the blacksmiths of Reidan until I die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No, you’re still young and healthy, so you have a lot of time left. Don’t say that even as a joke. Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid belatedly looked around the castle.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The other blacksmiths were watching him nervously.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Work had stopped since the duke came and they were also restless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You worked hard. Don’t mind me and continue what you were doing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The blacksmiths bowed deeply and returned to their place.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid stood next to Khan and observed them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"There are already two blacksmiths who have risen to the intermediate rank.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It had only been half a year since Reidan started training blacksmiths.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The fact that intermediate blacksmiths were already born was an incredible growth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The environment is good. They can often see the work of a legendary blacksmith, so their talent can bloom faster."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was useless to have excellent talent if the environment didn’t support them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reason why the blacksmiths of Reidan could develop rapidly was because they received teachings from Grid and Khan, and had a good space to work.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Until the day that they all become craftsmen, please continue to work for a long time Khan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan was the first friend in Grid’s life, so he was more important than anyone else.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was eager for Khan to live a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I understand. I will persistently survive and raise 10,000 craftsmen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a joke, but Grid wanted it to be reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I’m looking forward to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hah, truly. You want this old man to overdo it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You won’t grow old. You will still be in full swing even when you’re 70."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“So I will be in a cage?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oh, that’s a good idea?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Duke Grid and the commoner Khan, it was a strange relationship.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The difference between the two people was greater than the heavens and earth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yet they were on such friendly terms...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Indeed, our teacher is great!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The young blacksmiths felt more respect towards Khan and were brimming with enthusiasm.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The hammering sounds in Reidan didn’t stop today.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid confirmed that there were promising and talented blacksmiths.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was filled with joy as Irene greeted him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Dear husband~”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Irene ran into Grid’s arms with a large smile.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As always, she freely expressed her affection towards Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Irene’s love was delightful and precious for Grid, who had little experience with being loved by someone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m glad you have returned safely."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Irene buried her face in Grid’s wide chest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A pleasant smell exuded from her soft and clean skin.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I've missed you so much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I also wanted to see you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid kissed Irene’s forehead.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The words were great.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an an unimaginable appearance for the normal Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Indeed...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel saw Grid and Irene and gave a meaningful smile.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He covered half his face with one hand and sent a provocative gaze towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I saw it on the news, but I am convinced at this moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was confused by the words and looked at Lauel in a questioning manner.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kukuk, </span></i><span style="">Lauel’s shoulders shook as he laughed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You must’ve been my only friend and rival in a past life, Angel Sylvanus.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel’s chunnibyou symptom was in full bloom after witnessing the white haired Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He recognized Grid as similar to himself and included Grid in his delusional worldview.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘When will this sickness be healed…?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tsk, Grid ignored Lauel and touched Irene’s belly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“In the next two months, I can meet Gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huhut, that’s right. I wish that day will come quickly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Gold?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel’s face was disturbed as he regained his reason.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Grid, are you planning to call your child Gold?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Surely he wouldn’t name his child Gold?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was something that shouldn’t happen.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The possibility of it being called Grid II was also too big.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You have to consider the position of the child when naming it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid looked sharply at Lauel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What are you saying? I’m not crazy enough to call my child Gold? It’s just a temporary name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“R-Really?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was glad.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s naming sense was too bad.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Lauel asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What will you name the child when it is born?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid replied with a confident expression,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I was thinking of Grene after Irene.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grene.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was this a joke?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Of course it’s a joke.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel wanted to believe that.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid’s proud expression and Irene’s reaction were terrible.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Oh my, dear husband. The name Grene is too pretty. It is a pretty and cute name that will suit a boy or a girl.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What on earth…?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was scary.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Irene thought any suggestion from Grid was good.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Nobody knew that this absolute love and faith came from Grid’s dexterity.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s office.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid called Piaro and asked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What do you know about the 3rd Prince of the Saharan Empire?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"He’s the third son of the deceased Empress Aria and has an introverted personality, unlike his siblings. I only saw him a few times and don’t know any details. Why are you suddenly asking about him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid pulled the Amethyst Shield out of his inventory.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro’s eyes widened with surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"How do you have this...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"A monster called the Guardian of the Forest dropped it. It was originally an object of honor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It is a symbol that has been inherited from generation to generation by the captain of the Red Knights.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is there anything special about it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, it is just a shield with a gorgeous appearance. The performance itself isn’t very good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Then why is the 3rd Prince looking for this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"3rd Prince...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It seems like he is looking for several things.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hrmm.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro suddenly recalled one fact.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"That reminds me, there was a time when the 3rd Prince was interested in some ritual. His hobby is rituals, so he might be collecting the items necessary for it."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ritual? What ritual?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I don’t know. It is just likely that the Amethyst Shield is useful as a tool for the ritual.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hrmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was it a black magic ritual?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is a shame.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">It might be better not to hand these things over to the 3rd Prince.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘But it could be a quest related to an episode, so I can’t ignore it completely... Well, I’ll look at the situation and act accordingly.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the first place, it wasn’t urgent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had separate priorities.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that time, Lauel sent a whisper to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">A guest has come.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Guest?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The guest wouldn’t be normal if they could arrive in Reidan. In particular, the person must be big if Lauel was talking to him about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Who?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Chris.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Chris?</span></i> <i><span style="">3rd on the unified rankings?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yes.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris was the head of the Giant Guild, the largest of the seven guilds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid hadn’t heard about him since the First National Competition and the Reinhardt golem invasion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘But Chris has a hostile relationship with the Tzedakah Guild.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why would he take the risk to come here?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was interested and immediately rose from his spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Bring him to the drawing room.</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The Giant Guild lost their territory after the golem invasion and had a hard time for half a year.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, Chris’ reputation was hit hard because he was defeated by Regas in the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Chris and the Giant Guild didn’t get frustrated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They overcame the trials!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their power became bigger than before.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, Chris obtained a very useful second class. He was several times stronger than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, there was a problem.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t find a satisfactory weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Despite watching the item trading sites and in-game auction site for 24 hours a day, a suitable weapon didn’t show up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris gradually became nervous because he knew how important items were to the game.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thus, he looked for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Make me the strongest weapon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the first time Grid met Chris.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He only saw the 3rd ranking user on the news or from far away.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the past, the Giant Guild had a conflict with the Tzedakah Guild, but Grid had no personal grudge against Chris.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, the other members of the Tzedakah Guild were a problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I remember that Jishuka hates you quite a bit. Why should I ignore my guild members to make you an item?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had the advantage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was currently in a much higher position.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Of course, Grid didn’t intend this, but it worked out excellently.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris was in a bad position and had to bow to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will give you a lot of money. In addition, the Tzedakah Guild doesn’t have a big grudge towards me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Then why was there a feud?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It was due to my one-sided competition, and the Tzedakah Guild didn’t avoid the fight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">When playing the game called L.T.S., Chris and the Giant Guild had always been defeated by the Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The grudge was deeply rooted and this sense of competitiveness carried over to Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, the Tzedakah Guild didn’t even look at the Giant Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the victim who clung onto the relationship.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will check it out. In any case, how much will you pay me if I make you an item?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will give you something more precious than money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris pulled a potion out of his inventory.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s eyes widened as he examined the details.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Elixir...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a rare potion that was hard to obtain, even after clearing five vampire cities.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Companies with huge assets and rankers aiming for the top wanted them, but the supply was scarce and the price soared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elixirs were also necessary for Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">To be precise, it was the agility elixir.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In order for his swordsmanship to become more powerful, it was necessary to make his agility equal to his strength.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Coincidentally, the elixir that Chris presented was the agility elixir.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s brain started to rotate quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is a deal that must be unconditionally accepted.'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, there was a problem. Chris might become the enemy of Overgeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Obviously, he should avoid the act of making his enemies stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'But it is too good to decline... Aha.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ssik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A wicked smile appeared on Grid’s face as he contemplated the elixir in front of him.</span></p>
