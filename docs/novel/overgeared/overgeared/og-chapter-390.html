 <p><span>Chapter 390</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <hr>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>Who was the hero of the informal rankers?&nbsp;</span><span>If they heard such a question, ordinary people would say Grid.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid’s accomplishments were great.</span></p>
 <p><span>But there was a law that existed in every world.&nbsp;</span><span>There were those hiding in the darkness of Satisfy who were stronger than Grid.&nbsp;</span><span>Tarma was one of them.</span></p>
 <p><span>Tarma.&nbsp;</span><span>A player who had been acting as PKer since his early days in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span>A notorious dark gamer, he had a very brilliant career.&nbsp;</span><span>The most outstanding achievement...</span></p>
 <p><span>"The 2nd ranked Zibal lost his life to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span>It was true.&nbsp;</span><span>Tarma’s PK skills were unmatched. In the first place, he had a hidden class specializing in PKing.&nbsp;</span><span>The reigning Kraugel would lose his life to Tarma.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hoh, Tarma should be able to do it.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"If Tarma plays in PvP, he will be able to move onto the finals.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The top rankers and Overgeared members that Tarma would meet in PvP?&nbsp;</span><span>None of them could win in a one-on-one fight against Tarma. The executives of Blood Carnival felt reassured.&nbsp;</span><span>Tarma was that excellent.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Well, it’s doubtful that you will win against Kraugel just because you reach the finals.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"Kraugel is special.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“He’s a monster beyond the level of a genius. There’s no one except Agnus and the twins in our guild who can fight one-on-one with Kraugel and definitely win.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Shut up, you dog scum.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Tarma cursed at his colleagues.&nbsp;</span><span>He spoke confidently to the master hidden by a veil.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Tell this to the client. I, Tarma, will surely defeat Kraugel. Oh, and ask them to give me an allowance for every celebrity I defeat in PvP.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The master of the Blood Carnival smiled from behind his veil.&nbsp;</span><span>They trusted Tarma’s skills.</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>[Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation Skill]</span></p>
 <p><span>You can create three equipment item production methods every time the skill level of the ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill’ goes up.</span></p>
 <p><span>Number of items that can be created at present: 13/21.]</span></p>
 <p><span>* When items are produced using this skill, the name of the creator is automatically placed on the item.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation Skill.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The moment Grid used the skill.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Ttiring.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>There was a loud sound effect and the notification window appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span>[What item do you want to create?]</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Hrmm.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid didn’t want a powerful weapon.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid wanted a weapon that purely relied on luck.&nbsp;</span><span>He judged that it was the only method to deal with the clone.</span></p>
 <p><span>'I’m sick of making swords.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Anyway, it was a random item.&nbsp;</span><span>It wasn’t an item he would use often unless he was in a situation like this, so making a different form would be fun.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘It can’t be difficult to deal with, or have a low accuracy.’</span></p>
 <p><span>What was a fun and different weapon with a guaranteed hit rate?&nbsp;</span><span>Grid thought for awhile and recalled Piaro’s flail.&nbsp;</span><span>Flail.&nbsp;</span><span>A farming tool used to harvest grains.&nbsp;</span><span>There were three or four long twigs hanging at the end of a pole, and it was waved around.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘It is hard to avoid.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid came to this conclusion after thinking about his fight with Piaro and smiled wickedly.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘That damn clone... I will let you taste this dirty feeling.’</span></p>
 <p><span>He made a decision.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I want to create a flail.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Heok.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Sticks was surprised from where he was watching.&nbsp;</span><span>The Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation skill was a trump card of Pagma in the past.&nbsp;</span><span>It needed to be used carefully because there was a limited number of uses.&nbsp;</span><span>Yet Grid was using the skill to create a farming equipment.</span></p>
 <p><span>Sticks asked Grid,&nbsp;</span><span>“You’re going to use this to create a flail? Please give me a convincing explanation.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span>It was because he wanted to make a weapon with a high hit rate.&nbsp;</span><span>A flail was a weapon with a high hit rate.&nbsp;</span><span>But he also wanted something different, and being hit by a flail would give a dirty feeling to the target. It was a little embarrassing to answer honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hum hum.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid ignored Sticks and proceeded to the next stage of Item Creation.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Have you decided on a flail?]</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Yes.’</span></p>
 <p><span>[What materials would you like to use?]</span></p>
 <p><span>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span>The reason why Grid could think of producing an item with a random effect was thanks to the gift that Alchemist Silverun gave him before he left Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span>It was right after granting an option to Iyarugt and before heading back to the Behen Archipelago again.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I heard you are going to a very dangerous place. I will be praying for your safe return.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Silverun approached Grid and handed over a bottle filled with liquid.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Was he trying to poison Grid because he knew that Grid thought alchemy was useless?&nbsp;</span><span>Silverun smiled at Grid’s question and explained.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It is a mystery potion that I poured all my knowledge of alchemy into.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"What does that mean?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"I also don’t know.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“...What?”</span></p>
 <p><span>"Haha, to be precise, a random effect will be triggered. I’m excited because I don’t know the result. Isn’t this the attraction of alchemy? Anyway, if you’re in a moment of crisis, you can try drinking it. Who knows? The best results might happen.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span>This was a crazy person.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid completely lost trust in alchemy and the alchemists.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid had pledged not to use this liquid for all his life.&nbsp;</span><span>But now, a few days later.</span></p>
 <p><span>"The material will be Silverun’s Secret Remedy and black iron wood.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid was entirely dependent on Silverun’s secret remedy.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Have you decided?]</span></p>
 <p><span>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span>[Please design the item.]</span></p>
 <p><span>The moment that the materials for the item was determined, a blank blueprint appeared in front of Grid.&nbsp;</span><span>This was already the 9th item creation.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid skillfully drew on the blueprint.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>‘The flail used by Piaro is the ideal form for a flail.'</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Suksak suksak.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The flail drawn on the blueprint bore a striking resemblance to Piaro’s.&nbsp;</span><span>A long time passed.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid was pleased with the final design and pressed the confirmation button.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Have you decided? When you complete the blueprint, the number of available creation skill will decrease by one.]</span></p>
 <p><span>“I have decided.”</span></p>
 <p><span>[A great work of art has been completed.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[One skill count has been consumed.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Please describe the characteristics of the item.]</span></p>
 <p><span>A system that required the features of the flail.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid knew.&nbsp;</span><span>A fanciful description actually acted as a poison to an item.</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid started to carefully explain.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Designed with black iron wood, it has excellent elasticity and attack power. It is sharp, like a sword made out of steel. Silverun’s Secret Remedy is added, so there will be a random effect every time the target is struck.”</span></p>
 <p><span>[It has been applied.]</span></p>
 <p><span>The blueprint of the flail that Grid drew was modified.&nbsp;</span><span>The skill compensation effect.&nbsp;</span><span>After a while, the perfected flail design emerged in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Okay, this is good.’</span></p>
 <p><span>The flexible pole was 1.3m long, while the four twigs hanging from it were sharp and threatening like a blade.&nbsp;</span><span>It was more like farming equipment than a weapon, but Grid liked this.&nbsp;</span><span>It was already fun to see how the dignity of the enemy would collapse when they were beaten by farming equipment.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Please name the item.]</span></p>
 <p><span>The system made a final request.&nbsp;</span><span>This was Grid’s answer.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Motley Flail.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“...No, why?”</span></p>
 <p><span>The name was the worst.&nbsp;</span><span>Sticks was at a loss for words.&nbsp;</span><span>Well, it didn’t matter because Grid was satisfied with the completed design.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Motley Flail]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Rating: Unique ~ Legendary</span></p>
 <p><span>Unique Rating Information:</span></p>
 <p><span>Durability: 259/259 &nbsp;Attack Power: 143~191</span></p>
 <p><span>* A special effect will occur every time the target is hit. The effect is unpredictable.</span></p>
 <p><span>* Threshing speed will increase by 150%.</span></p>
 <p><span>* There is no guarantee how the condition of the threshed grain will change.</span></p>
 <p><span>Legendary Rating Information:</span></p>
 <p><span>Durability: 307/307 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 218~275</span></p>
 <p><span>* A special effect will occur every time the target is hit. The effect is unpredictable.</span></p>
 <p><span>* Threshing speed will increase by 200%.</span></p>
 <p><span>* There is no guarantee how the condition of the threshed grain will change.</span></p>
 <p><span>Farming equipment designed by Grid, who has been reborn as a legend.</span></p>
 <p><span>It’s made of solid black iron wood and has excellent durability and attack power. It’s at a level to be called a weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, the effects can’t be guaranteed due to the influence of Silverun’s Secret Remedy. Use with caution. It is recommended that you don’t use it.</span></p>
 <p><span>User Restriction: Level 200 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span>Weight: 109</span></p>
 <p><span>“Um... Black iron wood is expensive, but I would like to give a present to Piaro.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid spoke big words.&nbsp;</span><span>Anyway, thanks to this Motley Flail, Piaro later on... Omitted.</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>After the creation of the Motley Flail.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid logged out and rested, then returned to work in the best conditions.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Please give me a legendary item.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid had produced the 10th legendary item and went through the second special event.&nbsp;</span><span>Now he only got additional stats if he made a legendary item.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was natural that Grid hoped for the flail to have a legendary rating.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I wonder about the effect of the third special event.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid had stayed in Reidan for a while to make the Mass Production Grid Set.&nbsp;</span><span>He made more than 1,000 sets, with two legendary items successfully being produced.&nbsp;</span><span>Now Grid just needed three more legendary items to experience the third special event.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid wanted that day to occur, despite the possibility of a penalty. He believed that the benefits would outweigh the damage.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Now, shall I begin?”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Ttang!</span></em> <em><span>Ttang!</span></em> <em><span>Ttang!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Grid was fundamentally a blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span>His face was more energetic than ever as he knocked on the anvil with the hammer.</span></p>
 <p><span>Sticks felt strange.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Indeed, he has the coolness of a legend, but I don’t trust it.’</span></p>
 <p><span>A legendary blacksmith created farming equipment. It was even called the Motley Flail?&nbsp;</span><span>Sticks thought that Grid had already given up on cleaning the Behen Archipelago. His heart hurt.</span></p>
