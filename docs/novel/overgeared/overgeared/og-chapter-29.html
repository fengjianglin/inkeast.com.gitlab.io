 <p><span style="">Chapter 29</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The item production game with the Mero Company!&nbsp;</span><span style="">This quest was at A rank difficulty.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In other words, it was classified as a high difficulty quest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Common sense stated that it was impossible for a level 21 user to clear an A-grade quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was I going to fail this quest? Why did I accept such a hard quest?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was natural: I accepted the quest because I thought I could clear it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If this quest were related to combat or adventuring, I wouldn’t have much confidence. No, I would’ve turned down the quest in the first place. I wouldn’t be able to clear it at my current level, even if I was a legendary class.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But the item production game with the Mero Company required crafting an item to win.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A quest that would succeed if I made an item better than the blacksmith hired by the Mero Company.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I am the legendary blacksmith who has produced an epic arrow! I can win, even if the Mero Company hires an advanced level blacksmith. Kukuk, this is the quest for me... no, it’s an event!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As moonlight seeped in through the window, I smiled and spoke a splendid monologue, like a character from a manhwa.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan returned from picking up the item making tools in the warehouse and trembled at the sight of me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Did you eat something bad at dinner...? You look sick, are you okay? Do you need medicine? No, I will bring you to the doctor right now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Where do I look sick?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan didn’t seem to have a sense of aesthetics.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Tsk tsk, a blacksmith is a type of artist.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The works made by Khan were obviously inferior in appearance and performance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As I felt certain of this, Khan brought out a beautiful sword and helmet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"These are the pieces I made. What do you think? Isn’t it okay? I was famous for making really beautiful pieces during my prime. My aesthetic sense has always been admired by artists. Haha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...This old man, was he reading my thoughts?&nbsp;</span><span style="">As I gazed at the sword and helmet, Khan laid out various production tools.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"As you can see, the tools are properly stocked. There are various metals, ores, and logs of wood piled up in the warehouses. There are a lot of materials, but I haven’t done any business in the past months... But the result is good. You can use these materials during your training.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan smiled bitterly, so I couldn’t help asking him a question,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The Mero Company tried to put you into debt and hired gangsters to interfere in your sales. They also threatened and assaulted you. Why didn’t you ask for help from the lord or guards? Why stay quiet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I have filed a complaint with the guard captain several times and appealed to the lord. I wanted the guards to protect me and for the lord to stop this injustice, but they didn’t even look at me. My requests were ignored.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...I guess it was the work of the Mero Company.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Right. The Mero Company is one of the largest and richest companies in the north. The lord and guards have already received bribes from the Mero Company. It isn’t just me. Many other Winston residents were hurt by the Mero Company and thrown onto the streets, but the lord didn’t lift a single finger to help them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the end, money was the best.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Once again, I realized the greatness of money and vowed that I would be rich.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh? By the way, doesn’t Winston belong to Earl Steim?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why don’t you and the residents go to Earl Steim and accuse Winston’s lord? Then Earl Steim will punish... no, you don’t think that the hands of the Mero Company have reached Earl Steim?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It doesn't seem like it. We’ve tried many times to meet Earl Steim; however, the lord noticed and prevented us from leaving Winston every time. Even if we raise an appeal, it won’t be passed onto Earl Steim... The lord wouldn’t go so far to stop us if the earl is on his side.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"There isn’t anyone monitoring this place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The inspectors have been bought by the lord a long time ago.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yes, in the end, money was the best.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I accepted it and stood up. Then I lit the furnace and comforted Khan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Don’t worry. Now you have me. I will give the people of the Mero Company a flat nose. Do you trust me? Can you trust me and leave this part to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Of course I trust you. Pagma’s Descendant can win no matter what blacksmith is your opponent... Grid, you really are dependable. If my son was alive, he would be a similar age to you... that child would’ve been a good young man like you... sob...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan was an old man with a lot of tears.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But that didn’t seem to be the main issue.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It meant he was a man with a lot of scars.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Poor man.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...Eh?&nbsp;</span><span style="">What? Why was I feeling such sentiment?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Strangely, my mind weakened when I saw Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was Pagma’s ideology implanted in me without knowing after I became his descendant?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Khan has a great affinity with me, but I don’t know why I’m feeling like this.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I saw Khan slyly looking for a drink and sat down next to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Old Man, watch my work all night. Then you will soon forget about your drinking. You will be filled with the desire to be a blacksmith again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I-Is that so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ack! What was this? Why did I smile gently when I looked at the old man?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...Ah.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As I started into the fire of the furnace, I remembered an old memory I had forgotten.&nbsp;</span><span style="">When I was in elementary school, I was able to feel great happiness when I visited my grandfather’s house during the holidays.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I always felt better due to the warm love I received from my grandfather and grandmother.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I see. Khan’s atmosphere and way of talking resembled my grandfather.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Have a cup of tea. It is tea made of boiled Lunol leaves, and the fragrance is very good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Well, it isn’t bad. I would rather receive money but...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh? What did you say? The noise is so loud that I can’t hear you!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You can’t hear me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I can’t hear what you are saying!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Indeed, you are skilled.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kaaang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment of sharing tea and hammering iron with a person I liked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">My heart grew heavy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the first time I felt a precious moment in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"But you... how come your hammering form is like that? Was I mistaken because my expectations were too great? No? It’s not like that? It should look like this. No, you have to narrow your elbows a bit more... You... are you really the descendant of Pagma? T-Tell me honestly. Y-You’re not a scam artist, are you? Are you someone from the Mero Company?! I was crazy to accept Rabbit’s offer!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...This old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Be quiet! Can you see my skills so quickly? Ah, just leave me alone a little bit! Why are you taking the hammer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I judged your skills too quickly? This is too strange. Pagma’s descendant should’ve mastered this. A-A fraud! A crook.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ah, you... annoying.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The night deepened. But I didn’t rest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was in my peak condition. I should use this to improve my technical skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I improved my skills throughout the night, and Khan no longer called me a scammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then the next day, the training began in earnest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan saw my work and forgot about drinking, revealing his 60 years experience as a blacksmith. He helped me using the skills and knowledge that he accumulated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The thing to consider when making armor isn’t durability. The first thing is to design armor that will allow the wearer to move freely."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I examined armor and made it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Uhuh! The strength and weaknesses aren’t aligned properly! Why is only this part calibrated? You need to focus! You aren’t a three-year-old child, so why are you becoming so distracted?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was scolded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Amazing, amazing. Why is it so different as soon as you start concentrating? Your talent is endless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then I was praised after the scolding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There are some stupid seeds who stop when they think it is good enough. Their logic is that they are pushed for time, so they might as well take forging out of the question. But they are mistaken. Forging is not a minor task. If forging is omitted, the meaning of quenching and tempering will fade. If you’re lacking in time, then you should omit quenching instead of forging.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were deep teachings.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I agree with you. In the first place, does it make sense to skip processes just because of lacking time? Then an imperfect item will be made. No matter how much time it takes, I will try to make perfect things.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh! A respectable craftsman. As expected of Pagma’s descendant, having such noble ideas at a young age.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It isn’t a big deal. I just want to make perfect stuff to sell at a more expensive...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hahaha! Modesty is also a great virtue in a young man. You are respectable! Grid! It is the luck of a lifetime that I met you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He misunderstood my comments.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Either way, it was a happy time.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Um....”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I woke up before the alarm clock rang.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I looked through the curtain and saw that outside was still dark. I checked the time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It is only 4 a.m.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was too early. I could afford to close my eyes for at least 30 more minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">My usual self would grumble about waking up early before going back to bed. But today was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It is a refreshing morning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I felt good.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The day before, I spent two nights of Satisfy time and polished my blacksmithing skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I created three pieces of armor and two swords, with two of the items having a rare rating.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to that, all my stats rose by +4, the experience of my Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship skill was close to 20% and the experience of the Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath skill rose by nearly 8%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My concentration and sophistication improved, greatly increasing the speed of production.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan really helped a lot. He was different from Smith in Bairan Village.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Khan still hasn’t returned to his peak condition, but the difference between a low-level blacksmith and advanced level blacksmith is like the difference between the sky and the earth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I wanted to see Khan. I would be taught by him while making items. Growth was another attraction of leveling up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I wanted to see him as soon as I woke up in the morning?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Am I overdoing it?” </span><i><span style="">Sniff.</span></i><span style=""> “Let’s go shower.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I headed straight to the bathroom.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After a refreshing wash in hot water, I exited to see my mother preparing breakfast.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Good morning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Youngwoo, you rested yesterday. Has your fatigue improved? Why are you awake so early?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is the power of beef rib soup! It is the effect of eating something good. My physical condition ~ great. So I should eat some grilled eel...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why does a person with no girlfriend need to eat eel?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The words were spoken by my father, who was reading his newspaper in the room.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I puffed up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Are you ignoring me because I don’t have a girlfriend? There are many places where it will have an effect... no, who says I don’t have a girlfriend?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? Hohohohohoho~!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My mother grabbed her belly and started to laugh. She laughed so much that tears appeared.</span></p>
