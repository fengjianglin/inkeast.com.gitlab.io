 <p><span style="">Chapter 232</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The doppelganger couldn’t completely reproduce Pagma’s power in its entirety. Nevertheless, its stats were equivalent to Hell Gao.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Since Grid had a tendency to rely entirely on skills, it was natural that he was completely defeated in the first battle after Pagma’s Swordsmanship was blocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This horrific monster...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Fight again?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was unwilling.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wouldn’t the result be the same even if they fought a few times?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would be much more comfortable if Piaro went out and took care of it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he quickly fixed that idea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Piaro said to absorb Pagma’s Swordsmanship. Yes, this is a chance to become stronger.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">More and more strength.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He needed enough strength to do the things he had to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sigh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid hesitated before taking a deep breath.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuoooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The doppelganger stabbed forward.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The attack was deafening, and despite being 5m away, seemed like it would reach his stomach.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro exclaimed from behind him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“There are obviously limits to a greatsword. It’s big, dull and hard to move on the fly. The stabbing of a greatsword is extremely simple, and can easily be seen. Don’t worry about hidden weapons and block.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was convincing advice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s confidence was elevated and he moved calmly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Utilizing the footwork of Link to move left and right, he avoided the doppelganger’s stab.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kudududuk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The jade greatsword passed by the side of the Holy Light Armor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sparks scattered like firecrackers and the doppelganger could be seen beyond them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Once the stab misses, a gap will be exposed. This is an opportunity to hit back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A greatsword was big and heavy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What if the greatsword was stabbed but didn’t hit the target?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The person holding the greatsword would lose their balance and their posture would collapse.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid smiled with satisfaction as he counterattacked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His greatsword curved from the bottom up and aimed for the doppelganger’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was avoided.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The doppelganger demonstrated his agility by twisting his upper body to avoid being hit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the front of his clothing was loosened, clearing revealing the doppelganger’s upper body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kyaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Laella, a member of the party, let out a sound of appreciation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The doppelganger copied Pagma’s appearance and was so beautiful that he caught her heart instantly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that the sleek muscular body was the creation of a god.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the body wasn’t an important factor in battle.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Only the strong would win.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ohhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Failure passed over the doppelganger’s head and once again descended.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Sukakak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Heavy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid took full advantage of Grid’s boots, so the weight at the end of his sword was incomparable to before. He could even easily disintegrate a rock.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Could the doppelganger withstand it?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Of course, it was possible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This doppelganger had been a named boss of the Mysterious Forest for at least 100 years. Apart from its stats, its health would be in the millions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 17,790 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Indeed, there isn’t a single scratch on him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was dismayed when he saw that the doppelganger’s health gauge didn’t seem to decrease at all.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the jade greatsword aimed at Grid’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Ah!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A chill went down Grid’s spine.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The seven golden blades moved to protect Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They combined into one to form a barrier that defended against the greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But they couldn’t fully absorb the shock and became stuck in place. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro spoke again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“The biggest disadvantage of a greatsword is that it will take a long time to recover the weapon after an attack. You forgot this point and allowed a counterattack.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then what should he do?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">As Grid was confused, the momentum of the doppelganger rose again. He started an endless onslaught and didn’t allow time for Grid to take any countermeasures.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The pavranium moved to protect Grid, but there was a limit since it stiffened every time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The opponent’s behavior is correct. You should do it as well. If you take advantage of the recoil that occurs when you attack, you can link more strikes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Urgh...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid felt the need to stop the doppelganger’s attacks. If so, he should evade rather than defend.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In fact, Piaro had advised ‘don’t play around when you have a sword in your hand.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the enemy’s attack speed was much faster than Grid’s attack speed, so it wasn’t easy to react.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then what should he do?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid finally allowed an attack and the next blow aimed for his neck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro stepped forward again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He blocked the doppelganger’s sword and saved Grid’s life once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why do you only use the golden blades as a defense tool? Optimize your control and use them as weapons if possible. Now fight again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The same thing was repeated many times.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid listened to Piaro’s advice, dealt with the doppelganger and when faced with death from an error, he was saved by Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid felt like he was in a game room.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Just when I think the game is over, the neighborhood boy will put in another coin.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In fact, he had never met such a good person.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“If you have an opponent with higher health, you must go all out on attack instead of defense. Fight again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The technique of lifting from the bottom to the top is inevitably weaker because the force is countered by gravity. You might be using this technique to damage the enemy, but it is actually having an adverse effect. In the first place, is it possible with such a huge weapon? Fight again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t neglect the golden blades just because they can’t kill the enemy. If you make them persevere to cover the enemy’s view, they can be a bigger help than a few colleagues. Fight again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I explained why stabbing a greatsword is a simple technique, but I don’t know why you are so obsessed with it. You should only stab in a situation where you can definitely knock your opponent away. You should know that the greatsword is designed for both stabbing and slashing. Don’t forget to use the right greatsword technique when appropriate. Fight again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Fight again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Again! Again! Again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Pant pant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How many times did he need to repeat this damn battle?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It hadn’t been dawn when they arrived here in the bamboo forest but now the sun was high in the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was mentally and physically exhausted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, the Overgeared members...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yum yum. Grid is suffering a lot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The strongest NPC is teaching him swordsmanship and protecting his life, so how is he suffering? I would be excited.” </span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s exciting, but hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is it easy to fight for over half a day?” </span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Indeed... If I was continuously fighting against the enemy like Grid, my stamina would’ve reached its limit already.” </span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members were already freed from the helpless feeling and were eating in front of a campfire.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They baked and boiled the rainbow potatoes, relaxing as they watched Grid fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t because they were lazy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members also had a desire to join the raid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Growing through struggles was the joy they desired.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But they couldn’t move.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro was training Grid against Pagma’s doppelganger, so there was no room for them to intervene.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Anyway, Grid’s growth rate is remarkable.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel remarked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right. It’s a tremendous growth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The doppelganger had completely overwhelmed Grid in the first battle. He was attacked without being able to hit back once, and faced the crisis of death.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the second battle, Grid managed to strike once. The third battle, it was two attacks and the fourth battle, three attacks and so on.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And in the 51st battle, Grid was exchanging blows at a level comparable to the doppelganger. It was especially impressive the way he avoided death every time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid is a blank slate. It’s obvious if he grows even a little bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The synergy of the best teacher and best sparring partner (?) raised Grid’s control.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What user wouldn’t want to experience something like this?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members really envied Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I wish I had a mentor like that...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“How did Grid obtain such a great NPC?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s creepy that he was doing a farmer cosplay for a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was Piaro’s identity?&nbsp;</span><span style="">And what circumstances were there that led him to teach Grid?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It happened when the Overgeared members’ questions were deepening.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sob...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid eventually collapsed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His stamina was completely depleted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, the doppelganger was still fine.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had fought for half a day, but the doppelganger’s health was still at 9/10ths.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro stopped him from finishing off Grid and turned his gaze to the Overgeared members. Then he pointed to Regas.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh? Me?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas felt irritated when he saw that Grid was getting stronger and trained alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He imagined Pagma’s doppelganger as a virtual enemy in his mind, and started sparring against it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, he was stunned when Piaro suddenly pointed him out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro instructed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“You will deal with this enemy while Duke Grid is resting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas’ eyes shone like jewels.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Are you going to train me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro didn’t deny it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I have been watching your potential from a distance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas was jubilant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an opportunity to be trained by Piaro, who was stronger than anyone he knew.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro started the lesson as soon as he came running.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this…? That NPC will teach anyone?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Amazing! We can receive his teachings?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members were excited.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They expected to become stronger after being taught by Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And that expectation became reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Next."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro switched the members in turn and allowed them to spar against Pagma’s doppelganger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He also developed the Overgeared members by pointing out the strengths and weaknesses that he had observed while staying in Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was in the hope that they would become stronger and make him stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The great swordsman Piaro would be a great fortune to Grid and the Overgeared members.</span></p>
