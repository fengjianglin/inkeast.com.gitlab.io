 <p><span style="">Chapter 99</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Pagma’s Descendant could use all items, was almost immune to all status conditions, had a skill that made me immortal for a short time and other passive skills, as well as Pagma’s Swordsmanship. If I considered the overwhelming stats growth from the item production, it was a class that belonged to a combat type.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, Pagma's Descendant was fundamentally a blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From appraisal, to repair, enhancement, production, and creation...&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pagma's Descendant shone the most when it came to blacksmithing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The anvil, furnace, and other production tools all made up my main stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sigh. Sigh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I started pouring the mithril ore, coke, and limestone into the blast furnace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You can sense the temperature due to the rapid changes in ambient temperature. 30 degrees. 31 degrees. 31.5 degrees. 33 degrees. 36 degrees, 39...]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-Pagma’s descendant is sensitive to changes in temperature.</span></i> <i><span style="">If there is a furnace in the vicinity, you can accurately measure the temperature inside the furnace.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">I had already mastered the bellows... No, it was a legendary class that couldn’t be compared to a master.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The temperature of the furnace rose sharply as I intended.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[1,000 degrees. 1,100 degrees. 1,350...]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Mithril...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Iron was by far the most common material used for making items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Iron ore was suitable for smelting at temperatures between 1,150~1,250.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, smelting mithril required a much higher temperature and technique was needed to keep it within the required range.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have to maintain it exactly between 1,820~1840.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s why mithril smelting was only available for Advanced Blacksmith Mastery level 3 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t possible for average blacksmiths to raise the temperature of the furnace to higher than 1,800 degrees. Those with Advanced Blacksmith Mastery level 2 might be able to raise the temperature to 1,800 degrees, but it was impossible for them to control it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, it was simple for me as Pagma’s Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In particular, I already dealt with mithril while making the Divine Shield. I was able to smelt mithril even with my eyes closed. However, I couldn’t afford to not focus.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Suooooh.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The temperature of the furnace was fixed at 1,840 degrees and over time, the mithril ore started to melt slowly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Inside the blast furnace that was over 1,800 degrees, the melted mithril ore mixed with the carbon monoxide generated from the coke, and pig iron with carbon and mithril was made. At the same time, the separated impurities were turned into slag by the limestone and discharged separately.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This process was a reproduction of smelting methods used in modern iron foundries, which meant that the smelting in Satisfy copied modern smelting techniques.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">... This was written on the forums about the blacksmith class.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why do I need to understand the principles when I’m not even getting a license? Don’t I just need to do it properly?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I filled the mold with the molten metal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The mysterious orange color of mithril was so beautiful that it felt like my soul was flying away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Pretty... It is prettier than women...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Heok?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What am I thinking right now?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It felt like I was becoming a minerals otaku.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I had to do something if I didn’t want to introduce myself as ‘married to my job’ when I was 50.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No... But I’m actually not popular with women... I should at least have a relationship before I die, even if it isn’t marriage... Sigh...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I started to worry if I would really end up married to my job.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“How rotten...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After the incident with Ahyoung, my confidence with relationships had dropped to the bottom. When would I be able to overcome this aftereffect?&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was very worried about my future as I poured the molten minerals into the molds I prepared beforehand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now I needed to wait for the molten mineral to harden.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can’t play around while waiting.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Time was money. I had to cover the costs of all the money I spent on clothing, a haircut and food when I met Ahyoung.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I took the Tipan wood I set to one side and started to trim it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tipan was like an upgraded version of bamboo.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was dozens of times harder and resilient than bamboo, making it suitable to be used as a material for a spear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was popular when used to make ornaments because of its transparent blue color, but it was too expensive to be used for ornaments. Using Tipan wood as an ornament was one of the symbols of the rich.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Um.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I trimmed the Tipan wood into a straight form and cut it 178cm long.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Whoosh!</span></i> <i><span style="">Whoosh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">I swung it a few times as I felt the grip and weight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Even with this resilience, the strength is comparable to steel... It is expensive.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This would be the shaft for the Gale Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The harmony of the silver and blue was bound to make the spear beautiful and luxurious.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Next is the sharp point of the spear.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I completed the shaft of the spear and pulled out the semi-solid mithril inside the mold.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then I armed myself with my production item.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Unknown Blacksmith’s Hammer]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 350/350 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 70~80&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Odds of Making a Rare Rated Item: +17%&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Odds of Making a Epic Rated Item: +7%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A blacksmith’s hammer made by a craftsman with great skill and potential, but somewhat lacking in experience and reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This is a hammer produced by the craftsman himself, so it isn’t suitable for other blacksmiths to use.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Conditions of Use: Pagma’s Descendant</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 80&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Certainly, since I’ve made the hammer, the chances of making rare and epic items have increased.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was just a pity that it didn’t increase the chances of making unique and legendary rated items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But that was because the hammer itself was epic rated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I believed that a unique rated hammer would increase the chances of making unique rated items and the legendary hammer would increase the chances of making legendary items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Sooner or later, I will make a legendary rated hammer.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">I repeated the work of heating the mithril, forging with a hammer and exhausting the amount of carbon in the mithril to a suitable amount. This was the steelmaking operation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The tempered mithril became more refined and took the shape of a spear blade.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sigh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My body was drenched in sweat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was the thick fog of dawn outside the window.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang~!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttaang~!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Apart from the sound of adventurers coming back from hunting, there was only the sound of my hammering on the quiet Winston streets.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Four hours later.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I completed the mithril point to satisfaction and attached the griffon tendons to it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The first of the three Gale Spears commissioned by Pon was completed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath has increased the effectiveness of your production items]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Good!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Fortunately, the breath buff was activated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now the key was the rating of the item...!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I watched the information window that appeared in front of me with anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Gale Spear]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 432/432 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 476</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Critical Chance: +5% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atack Speed: +10%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Attack speed will increase by 1% for every attack that connects.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The skill ‘True Illusion’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The skill ‘Creator’s Wish’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An item made by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but his experience and reputation is somewhat lacking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It is very light so the more skilled the user, the more the power can be maximized. However, this lightness can be a disadvantage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It contains the origin of the craftsman who wishes to be reborn as an excellent spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 240 or higher. More than 750 strength. More than 400 agility. Advanced Spear Mastery level 2 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 200&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A unique rated item was produced, so all stats have permanently risen by +12 and reputation throughout the continent has risen by +300.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh? Huh? Oh~! Ohhhh! Wahhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I had made two legendary items, the Sword of Self-transcendence and the Divine Shield. But my only unique item was the Ideal Dagger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In fact, legendary items were less likely to be produced than unique items, but there wasn’t much difference. In other words, making a unique item was just as difficult as a legendary item.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A unique item appeared at once!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Puhahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was so happy it was like I could fly away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is even more of a jackpot because of the effect of the breath skill.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The unique rated Gale Spear specified in the production method had a total durability of 363 and an attack power of 400.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But my unique rated Gale Spear was 19% more durable and strong than what was described in the production method.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was impressed because the Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill (Lv.2) raised the stats of the item by 12% and the Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath (Lv.2) increased it by 7%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What is the Creator’s Wish skill?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I checked the added skill information.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Creator’s Wish]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The damage of the weapon will increase by 30% for two minutes. It can overlap with the same type of buff effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weapon Durability Consumption: 100</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hah...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It increased the weapon damage by 30% for two minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an ordinary performance, not much different from normal buff skills. No, in general, the average duration of a buff skill was 10 minutes so this was somewhat lacking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But there was something that had to be noted. The big part was that it could overlap with the same type of buff effect.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If ‘Creator’s Wish’ was used with a ‘Weapon Enchant’ skill that increased damage by 30%, that effect would stack up and the damage to the opponent would be +60%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was a very rare skill because it wasn’t common for buffs to overlap.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a skill that required weapon durability, not mana. It was a very good skill as a trump card, but there was a big penalty that the durability decreased by 100.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk... This is a big hit. Should I share this item information with the guild and surprise everyone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I imagined Jishuka and the guild members’ admiration and praise.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, I was anticipating Pon’s reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had handed me materials to create three Gale Spears and said,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I’ve met a lot of blacksmiths so I realize how hard it is to produce epic rated items. I have obtained enough materials for three spears and don’t be burdened. I won’t be disappointed if an epic rated spear doesn’t appear, so just make it casually. To be honest, a rare rated spear isn’t bad to use as a sub-weapon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I felt bad when I thought about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What, you aren’t expecting an epic spear to emerge? You will be satisfied even with a rare rating? Hah~ A legendary blacksmith can’t produce only rare rated results?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">... Actually, when I made an item 10 times, almost all of them were rare items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This time I can pretend. I made a unique item in one go!'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How much would Pon pay for this spear?&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was so excited it felt like my heart was going to explode.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this... I am going to make a huge amount of money three days in a row after the Malacus raid. Is this reality? I feel strange... After finishing this request, I should write up a household account book.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was almost lunch time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I started making the item from the evening before and it took more than half a day to complete.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah, I’m tired. I want to sleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I felt a great sense of accomplishment and now that the tension was released, I became sleepy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Let’s not share information about the Gale Spear just yet... I was given three days on the assumption that I would make three spears... I’ll show them two days later...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I would like to aim at making a legendary Gale Spear with the remaining materials.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Finally, today...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After commissioning the Gale Spears from Grid, Pon devoted himself to hunting for all three days.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And for three days, he became more dissatisfied with the weapon that he was currently using.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had moved to a hunting ground where the monsters gave higher experience. As the level of the monsters increased, the limits of the level 190 spear became clearer to Pon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a spear he had been using for 53 levels, from level 190 to 243 but...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon’s sensitivity couldn’t ignore the inferior nature of the spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I want to get rid of this damn spear soon.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon finished hunting and relaxed. As he was preparing to go hunting again, Grid typed into the guild chat window.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Pon, the three Gale Spears have been completed, so come to Khan’s smithy when you have time.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Ohh~! The spears are finally complete! What rating did you get?}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{I'm curious~ ^^ Please share the information window Grid.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The guild members became excited.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pon watched the chat window with half excitement and half unease as he waited for the information of the Gale Spears to appear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid reported shocking news.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{I’m ruined... I don’t want to post it here so come and check.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner laughed because he liked it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ It seems that only rare-rated spears have appeared ~! Yes! Serves you right, Pon!}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon was honestly disappointed, as he had been expecting at least one epic Gale Spear after seeing Grid easily learn the production method and reinforce Vantner’s axes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I am prepared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The basic performance of the Gale Spear was so good that it could be used even if it was rare rated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pon immediately stopped hunting and walked to Winston. The distance of the new hunting ground to Winston wasn’t far.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Three hours later.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He arrived at Khan’s smithy and saw several guild members, including Jishuka and Vantner.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pon frowned at the chuckling Vantner.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why are all of you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I want to see your disappointed look. Well? Do you have a complaint? Kya kya kyak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Damn scum.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Do you have a complaint? Tell me if you have any complaints! I will show you the power of my upgraded axes! Kya kya kyak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner was extremely confident after his weapon was strengthened by Grid. He moved his hunting ground to a stronger place, chatted more frequently and made fun of Pon every time he saw Pon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He is too excited. I’m honestly very envious.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon trembled at the thought of his rival doing well alone and approached Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid, you must’ve suffered.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon had told Grid when commissioning the spears that he wasn’t expecting too much, so don’t be burdened. It was true, but he still couldn’t help hiding his disappointment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid looked at Pon with sleepy eyes and handed over three spears.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m ruined. I thought I would get a legendary spear since a unique one appeared from the beginning but... They were both epic rated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was Grid saying?&nbsp;</span><span style="">All the members, including Pon, were stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unique? Legendary?&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, it was known that legendary items couldn’t be produced so they thought that Grid might be delirious.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then Pon’s complexion turned white and blue.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Gale Spear (Epic) has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Gale Spear (Epic) has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Gale Spear (Unique) has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...What?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon had felt an electrifying thrill in Satisfy only two times.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At first, he was amazed and thrilled by the game Satisfy itself. A virtual reality game that was truly another reality. As the creator of Satisfy, Lim Cheolho was a god who created a new world.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The second time was when he encountered the first ranked user on the unified rankings, Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon and Jishuka accidentally encountered him and were shocked and thrilled. He felt sorry towards Jishuka, but Kraugel was Satisfy’s one and only genius. Pon always had a high position in every game he played, but that had been the first time he felt shabby in front of a user.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">And now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid... You...! You!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon felt his third thrill as he saw the detailed information of the unique rated Gale Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He regained the confidence that had been lost.&nbsp;</span><span style="">With Grid, it felt possible to cross the wall of Kraugel, who could never be overcome with the Tzedakah Guild’s strength.</span></p>
