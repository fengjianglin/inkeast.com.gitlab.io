 <p><span style="">Chapter 231</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment he locked eyes with Pagma.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Duguen!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid stiffened and his heart beat faster.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His eyes shook as sweat started running down his body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a phenomenon of fear that transcended tension and agitation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was he overwhelmed by the killing intent that Pagma was emitting?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was sheer instinct.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The source of all his abilities was Pagma, so he couldn’t help feeling awe and a sense of smallness when facing Pagma.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Wake up.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid sobered up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘This guy is just a doppelganger of Pagma. Don't be misled by appearances.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The name that floated above his head wasn’t Pagma, but ‘Doppelganger of the Mysterious Forest.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid confirmed this again and barely controlled his mind.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After a moment, his composure was restored.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It will be hard.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Who would’ve expected that the target of the raid would be Pagma’s doppelganger?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘I never even imagined it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Looking back at it now, the features described by the Overgeared members resembled Pagma.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But hadn’t Pagma died more than 100 years ago?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was virtually impossible to imagine that the present doppelganger could copy a person from so long ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The staring battle between Grid and the doppelganger continued.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were all types of complex emotions and doubts in Grid’s eyes, while the doppelganger only contained hostility towards the enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was clear that this situation couldn’t be contained.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The doppelganger attacked Grid first.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He lightly swung a jade green greatsword in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid blocked the descending greatsword with Failure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The destructive power behind the blow was beyond imagination.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The attack power was comparable to Hell Gao who was in a perfect condition.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Lauel! A doppelganger copies the appearance of the target. But can it completely copy their abilities as well?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">He hurriedly asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel shook his head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"There are limits to a doppelganger’s ability to copy. It can’t fully copy the ability of a person stronger than itself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It meant that the doppelganger wasn’t as strong as Pagma, who was the greatest swordsman after Muller.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In other words, the doppelganger in front of Grid was an unfinished product that couldn’t completely copy Pagma’s power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Crazy..!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bottom, side, top.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The doppelganger showed off a dazzling skill with the greatsword, with barely a time difference in each strike. This drove Grid back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The durability of the +9 Failure has decreased by 3.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The durability of the +9 Failure has decreased by 8.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Even the performance of the weapon was great.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the first time he saw a weapon that could damage the durability of Failure so quickly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If the durability of Failure was compromised, it meant that the doppelganger’s weapon dealt twice the damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Lauel! What about the doppelganger’s ability to copy items?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The material that made up a doppelganger was so flexible that it reproduced human hair and skin, even tears and blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Depending on its strength, it can exert a strength comparable to orichalcum. Due to this, most items reproduced by doppelgangers are known to perform better than the original.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was impossible to completely copy the works of the legendary blacksmith, Pagma.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The greatsword used by the doppelganger was obviously below the level of the original.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Nevertheless, it can deal such damage to Failure?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s pride was crushed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had been trying so hard for the two years since becoming Pagma’s Descendant, but he couldn’t even be compared to Pagma’s copy?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Chaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s sword became increasingly dull due to his agitation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, the sword of the doppelganger was as sharp as ever, since his emotions never changed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chukak.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Uh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid finally started to become injured.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Red blood stained his clothing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The flow of battle was heading towards Grid’s defeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Quickly help Grid...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members were nervous.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They wanted to go out and help Grid right away.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was difficult to take a step because they were still caught by the feeling of helplessness.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This helpless feeling was so strong that they wouldn’t be able to move their fingertips unless their survival instincts were invoked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“We have to hope that Grid will survive until the doppelganger attacks us...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“But look at this. Isn’t the doppelganger’s swordsmanship extremely similar to Grid’s swordsmanship?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right. I wasn’t sure before, but now that they are side by side, the two sword styles look exactly the same.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It can’t be...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members figured out the doppelganger’s identity. To be precise, it was the identity of the person that the doppelganger copied.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the weight of that name wasn’t light, so they couldn’t express it with their mouths.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, Lauel had no such obstacles.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“It seems to be Pagma, as everyone is thinking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pagma.&nbsp;</span><span style="">One of the nine legends and the source of Grid’s strength.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a result of the golem invasion, Grid encountered Pagma’s doppelganger in the west.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What did this suggest?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Through this raid, Grid will go through a big change. He will acquire new skills, quests or items and he will develop dramatically. The reason why the king appointed Grid as lord of Reiden is due to Satisfy’s arrangements for Pagma’s Descendant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel looked at it from a very positive perspective. It was the same for the other Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Meanwhile, Grid defended against the onslaught of the doppelganger and he couldn’t retreat as the bamboo forest blocked the exit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was no place to back off anymore, so he could only counterattack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Damn! Let’s try it once!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How long was he going to be pushed by Pagma’s clone, who wasn’t even Pagma?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moment when Grid was about to use Pagma’s Swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Stop!"&nbsp;</span><span style="">The silent Piaro suddenly shouted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was surprised and stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The doppelganger’s sword had slashed through the spot where Grid was about to move to.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If Grid had used Pagma’s Swordsmanship, his heart would’ve been pierced by that greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Gulp.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid swallowed his dry saliva as Piaro scolded him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why aren’t you calm? Watch the opponent. The difference between him and you isn’t great. There is no reason for it to be so one-sided.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The difference wasn’t great?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wasn’t his attack speed and attack power twice as high as Grid’s?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro gave the confused Grid a hint.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Just as he knows your swordsmanship, don’t you also know his swordsmanship? If so, can’t you cope?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If it was four months ago, Grid would’ve found it hard to understand Piaro’s advice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now it was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had steadily developed thinking skills in his everyday life. As a result, he was able to use Piaro’s advice as perfect nourishment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘That’s right. That guy’s swordsmanship is based on Pagma.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">A stabbing attack contained the simplified footwork of Kill while a slash had the simplified footwork of Link.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘If I watch his foot movements, I can predict his next attack.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Again, let’s do it properly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid took a deep breath.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In this gap, the doppelganger had taken two steps forward.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the footwork of Link.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A slashing attack.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But would it be horizontal or vertical?&nbsp;</span><span style="">If it was horizontal, would it come from the right or left side?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Read the enemy’s gaze and shoulder motions.'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He recalled Piaro’s teachings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The right!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The movement was seen.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid succeeded in detecting and avoiding the doppelganger’s sword, despite it moving twice as fast as him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a very good move, impressing everyone watching.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He listened to the advice of the farmer and...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'He grew in real time?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is going on?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The eyes of the Overgeared members’ widened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their gazes turned towards Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro was standing with folded arms.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the opposite of the members who were filled with the helpless feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It can’t be...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He wasn’t just a farmer?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was when the Overgeared members were starting to realize Piaro’s identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Link!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pipit!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pipipipipit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Dozens of blue-white energy blades were created.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Did it shatter the body of the doppelganger?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It failed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The doppelganger completely blocked Grid’s attack using the same technique.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaeeeeeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The blue-white blades and the jade blades collided together, causing the bamboo to shake from the force.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members watched with amazement and awe.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid used another skill to not lose his momentum.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, once again, the doppelganger reacted with the same technique to neutralize Grid’s attack.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The collision between Kill and Kill caused a powerful explosion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The center of the forest was destroyed because it couldn’t cope with the explosion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The rock where the doppelganger first sat was shattered and the fragments scattered everywhere, injuring the Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"How about this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid used a fusion skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This skill was based on his own experience, so he thought the doppelganger wouldn’t have this skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Transcended Link!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A total of 20 strikes that dealt 180% physical damage was shot out with no time difference.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a merciless bombardment that even turned an ancient weapon to rags, so Grid didn’t doubt its power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the doppelganger coped by using a skill that Grid didn’t know yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Revolve.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid and the Overgeared members’ eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The doppelganger moved the jade sword in a half moon and absorbed all the energy of Transcended Link, while a vortex appeared around the doppelganger?&nbsp;</span><span style="">This wasn’t the end.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The energy of Transcended Link that was sucked into the vortex reappeared. At the same time, it reversed course and aimed for Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a perfect counterattack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"My Lord!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 20 energy blades moved through the bamboo forest in a zigzag, heading towards Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members were certain that Grid would die.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Piaro didn’t allow it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He suddenly appeared in front of Grid and pulled out his sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he struck the blue-white energy blades one by one.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Two.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Three.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Four.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">In turn, he blocked all 20 blows.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members and Grid couldn’t believe the sight that was in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Blowing away my Transcended Link like hitting a baseball...? Was Piaro this strong?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No... What the hell is this farmer?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As an awkward silence flowed, Piaro stepped back and urged Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Fight again from the beginning. Absorb the techniques in Pagma’s Swordsmanship that you don’t know and make them your own. Then you will become stronger."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro had figured out the identity of the doppelganger with the second blow that Grid and the doppelganger exchanged.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he didn’t step forward because he judged there was no value in it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is a great stepping stone for Duke Grid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The private lessons of the continent’s greatest swordsman, the second stage began.</span></p>
