 <p><em><span>Peok peok!</span></em></p>
 <p><em><span>Peok peok peok!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The battle between Grid and the rabbits was coming to an end.&nbsp;</span><span>He squeezed out his last remaining power to prevent the rabbits from attacking, evading and then succeeding in a counterattack to win.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Jjik!</span></em></p>
 <p><em><span>Kuuong!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>“Hahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The rabbits made X-shaped eyes and died.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid saw them and felt like a 10 year slump had disappeared.&nbsp;</span><span>He had been killed by rabbits more than a dozen times in the past!&nbsp;</span><span>He was glad to be able to erase that terrible black history that he didn’t want to think about again. His mind was lightened and pleasure filled his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>He felt rejuvenated.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Kuahahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid laughed with joy. Of course, he paid special attention to his image as lord of Reidan and master of Overgeared. He tried to laugh in as dignified a manner as possible.&nbsp;</span><span>Sticks’ face was confused as he watched Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘One of the nine legends, Pagma’s Descendant is fighting with rabbits?’</span></p>
 <p><span>It couldn’t be.&nbsp;</span><span>Sticks denied reality and urged Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Grid, stop joking and start now.”</span></p>
 <p><span>This seemed like a peaceful forest, but there would certainly be a fearsome monster at the end.</span></p>
 <p><span>'I encountered a gourmet dragon... What if Grid encounters a light dragon or dark dragon?’</span></p>
 <p><span>He wouldn’t be deceived by Grid who was harassing ‘innocent’ rabbits. There was a high possibility that a rare dragon existed in this forest.&nbsp;</span><span>In a short while, Grid would fight against the dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span>The moment Sticks tried to maintain his tension.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Fla~sh!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>A flash of light fell onto Grid’s body, who was holding a wooden sword above a rabbit.&nbsp;</span><span>It was the symbol of a level up.&nbsp;</span><span>Sticks saw it and faced reality.</span></p>
 <p><span>“D-Don’t tell me... Does this mean hunting rabbits was really your biggest ordeal?”</span></p>
 <p><span>No, what was this?&nbsp;</span><span>Sticks couldn’t understand it at all.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hum hum.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid turned away from the confused Sticks. He was embarrassed and had nothing to say. He just checked the notification window that appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p>[10 <span id="footnote-10">stat points have been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Okay.’</span></p>
 <p><span>The lower the level, the lower the power of the stats.&nbsp;</span><span>The basics stats were so low that it was easy to feel strong with a new investment of stat points.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘First of all, increase agility to 10.’</span></p>
 <p><span>The rest would be invested in strength.&nbsp;</span><span>It was the ideal stat distribution to increase the speed of hunting for novice beginners.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Your agility has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Your agility has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span>...</span></p>
 <p><span>[Your strength has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Your strength...]</span></p>
 <p><span>...</span></p>
 <p><span>Gaining three levels was the condition to clearing the 30th island.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid invested his stat points without any delay.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Next is the deer.’</span></p>
 <p><span>He faced the threat that were the thirsty deer at the lake shore.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Sneak sneak.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Grid approached the deer as sneakily as possible.&nbsp;</span><span>Originally, the deer were difficult for level 2 beginners.&nbsp;</span><span>The deer’s physical strength and attack power was at least three times higher than rabbits.</span></p>
 <p><span>But who was Grid?</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I am a legend!’</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid was filled with courage as he hunted the deer.&nbsp;</span><span>He paid attention to the deer’s kick, keeping a distance favorable to him before striking the deer with the sword.</span></p>
 <p><span>The 30th island.&nbsp;</span><span>The worst gateway that caused a challenger’s despair by 100% reproducing their worst trial...</span></p>
 <p><span>It was the moment when 1st ranked Kraugel’s place of frustration was turned into a basic training field for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>[You have succeeded in the mission.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[500 challenger points have been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Your level has returned to normal.]</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid, who returned to the level 306 Pagma’s Descendant from the level 3 beginner, was impressed.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘My body feels great.’</span></p>
 <p><span>His body was light and boiling with power. He stretched out his hand and a sharp wave burst out. He jumped slightly and reached an explosive height. &nbsp;</span><span>He had perfect and delicate control over each of his 10 fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span>This was the flesh of a legend, compared to a level 3 beginner.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I was unaware that my body has grown to this extent.’</span></p>
 <p><span>In other words, it meant he hadn’t been using his body properly.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Moving forward, I have to pay more attention to it.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid contemplated on his past self. &nbsp;</span><span>He was growing in real time.&nbsp;</span><span>Sticks wasn’t aware of this and asked with a loud voice.</span></p>
 <p><span>“...Are you really Pagma's Descendant?”</span></p>
 <p><span>It was a question full of distrust.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid’s appearance was shocking as he struggled with the rabbits and deers.&nbsp;</span><span>In the end, Grid couldn’t ignore him any longer and spoke honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I am dull-witted. I was always inferior to others, and went through trials that others wouldn’t have experienced. Does that mean I shouldn’t be a legend?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Pride was in Grid’s eyes.&nbsp;</span><span>It was pride in himself.&nbsp;</span><span>Sticks felt his confidence and shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span>"No, that isn’t it. I don’t have any doubts.”</span></p>
 <p><span>A dull-witted person was born again as a legend.&nbsp;</span><span>That was even better than the genius legends.&nbsp;</span><span>It meant he tried harder than anyone else.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Maybe I respect you more.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Sticks smiled and spoke in a straightforward manner.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid smiled in response and walked to the gate of the 31st island.</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>[You have entered the 31st island.]</span></p>
 <p><span>The 31st island was uncharted territory for Sticks.&nbsp;</span><span>He was surprised to see the scene stretched out in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span>“City...?”</span></p>
 <p><span>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span>The 31st island was a city.&nbsp;</span><span>Hundreds of buildings were lined in four rows, and the streets were crowded with carriages and people.&nbsp;</span><span>‘Where is this place? Why is a city recreated?’&nbsp;</span><span>Grid’s voice was heard as Sticks tried to reason it out.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This is the fortified city of Patrian.”</span></p>
 <p><span>He couldn’t forget the city that he stayed in for one year, from level 1 to level 80.</span></p>
 <p><span>“But why was this recreated? From what I recalled, I died less than 10 times in the city.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Huh? You died so many times within a city? Did you commit a crime that deserved the death penalty?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“No way, that’s impossible. I was just walking on the streets when I was hit by a wagon, died from a flowerpot dropped from the third floor, or was caught and killed by hoodlums.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"Your luck isn’t ordinary.”</span></p>
 <p><span>As the two people talked, several notification windows popped up.&nbsp;</span><span>Thanks to this, Grid knew what needed to be done here.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Your level has dropped to level 23.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[A mission will be created.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[31st Island]</span></p>
 <p><span>The place and situation of the quest that you failed the most number of times has been 100% created.</span></p>
 <p><span>Overcome the trial and jump past your previous self!</span></p>
 <p><span>Mission Clear Conditions: Succeed in the quest that you failed in the past.</span></p>
 <p><span>First Clear Reward: 600 Challenger Points.</span></p>
 <p><span>First Clear Reward 2: The rewards you obtain with the quest.</span></p>
 <p><span>[The mission will start 30 minutes from now.]</span></p>
 <p><span>"The quest I failed the most times?”</span></p>
 <p><span>It was difficult to pinpoint what quest he failed the most number of times.&nbsp;</span><span>A golden exclamation point appeared on one side as Grid tried to recall the memory.&nbsp;</span><span>It was a quest window.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Participate in the Reserve Forces Training]</span></p>
 <p><span>Level of Difficulty: Regular quest.</span></p>
 <p><span>Patrian is a fortified city built for the purpose of controlling the Gauss Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span>Players who belong to Patrian are obliged to do a certain amount of training as part of the reserve forces.</span></p>
 <p><span>Train under the instructor at the training ground.</span></p>
 <p><span>Quest Clear Condition: Get a passing grade for each training course.</span></p>
 <p><span>Quest Reward: Depends on the passing rank.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Ah, this quest.”</span></p>
 <p><span>It was a quest that repeated once a month.&nbsp;</span><span>They would be trapped in the barracks if they refused to do it. It was an obligatory quest that users belonging to Patrian had to perform.&nbsp;</span><span>Of course, Grid also participated in the&nbsp;full time training.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, there was a problem.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I never got a passing score...’</span></p>
 <p><span>He didn’t know how many times he failed.&nbsp;</span><span>It couldn’t be helped.&nbsp;</span><span>The significance of the military training was to raise usable soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span>It was natural for Patrian to endeavor to nurture reservists to a level that could be used.&nbsp;</span><span>The problem was that Grid didn’t respond to Patrian’s efforts.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘The training was too difficult.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Patrian’s reserve army training was largely divided into weapons training, formation building training, and squad training, which was very difficult.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘There were many people besides me who didn’t receive a passing mark.’</span></p>
 <p><span>In fact, there were less than 10 people, but Grid’s memories showed that there were hundreds of them.</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>Name: Grid</span></p>
 <p><span>Class: Warrior</span></p>
 <p><span>Level: 23</span></p>
 <p><span>Health: 1,161 &nbsp; &nbsp;Mana: 45</span></p>
 <p><span>Strength: 187 &nbsp; Stamina: 40</span></p>
 <p><span>Agility: 22 &nbsp; &nbsp; Intelligence: 15</span></p>
 <p><span>Skills Possessed:</span></p>
 <p><span>Beginner Sword Mastery Lv. 2, Beginner Armor Mastery Lv.2, Charge Lv. 1, Full Swing Lv. 1.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The stats distribution is too ignorant.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The balance of stats was too bad.&nbsp;</span><span>He wanted to curse his level 23 self.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘It’s all about strength except for a little bit of stamina.’</span></p>
 <p><span>His agility and intelligence was stagnant as the basic ability of a warrior.&nbsp;</span><span>His attack speed and evasion were the lowest, and he didn’t have the mana to use skills.&nbsp;</span><span>Using the Charge or Full Swing skill once would deplete all his mana.</span></p>
 <p><span>The items he had:</span></p>
 <p><span>[Blunt Greatsword]</span></p>
 <p><span>Attack Power: 32~71</span></p>
 <p><span>Attack Speed: -3%</span></p>
 <p><span>[Old Skull Helmet]</span></p>
 <p><span>Defense: 2</span></p>
 <p><span>[Old Orc Armor]</span></p>
 <p><span>Defense: 13</span></p>
 <p><span>[Old Goblin Shoes]</span></p>
 <p><span>Defense: 2</span></p>
 <p><span>‘The items are also messed up... No, isn’t it better to have set items from one type of monster?’</span></p>
 <p><span>How had he been playing the game in the past?</span></p>
 <p><span>‘This is why I only reached level 80 despite playing the game for a whole year... No, I only got to level 79.’</span></p>
 <p><span>He could only sigh.&nbsp;</span><span>In his current state, it was doubtful if he could clear the quest.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I just need to focus on the training and it will be good.’</span></p>
 <p><span>It was a matter of technical training and sparring.&nbsp;</span><span>He could handle the sword at a good level and was also decent with the spear due to Pon. Therefore, he was only worried about archery.&nbsp;</span><span>He didn’t have Bow Mastery and his agility was the lowest, so he wondered if he could hit the target with a single arrow.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I am also worried about not being able to use skills properly during the spar.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Sticks looked at Grid’s anxious expression and became nervous.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Is the difficulty of this trial so high? Don’t tell me...! This time it is a dragon...!”</span></p>
 <p><span>He was suffering under a curse from a dragon, so his dragon trauma was quite strong.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Don't worry. You won’t meet a dragon when you are with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid reassured Sticks and took a deep breath.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Now believe in me.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Since becoming Pagma’s Descendant, he went against many enemies that ordinary users couldn’t overcome alone.&nbsp;</span><span>Now he would overcome his past self.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid braced himself and entered the training camp.&nbsp;</span><span>The instructor saw him and shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span>"There you are, Blue Falcon! You’re late again! Hurry up, hurry, you bastard who is weaker than a dog!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Blue Falcon! (<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blue_falcon">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blue_falcon</a>)</span></p>
 <p><span>It was an embarrassing nickname that he had erased from his memories.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid’s face distorted like a demon as he stared at the instructor.&nbsp;</span><span>The castle’s training instructor.&nbsp;</span><span>The old man who ignored him and harassed him to death!</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I might’ve had no experience at that time...!’</span></p>
 <p><span>But not anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I will make shock appear on your face!’</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid’s determination was boiling up.</span></p>
