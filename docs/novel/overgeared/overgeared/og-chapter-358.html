 <p><span style="">Chapter 358</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have entered the first island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The first island was much smaller than Grid expected. The area of one tenth of Yeouido Park. The structure was very simple.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were several rock piles, as well as white sand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There isn’t anything?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was looking around with confusion when he saw the notification window that popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A mission will be created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[First Island]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Survive for 20 minutes!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">First Clear Reward: 1 Challenger Point.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The mission will start 30 minutes from now.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Survive?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This place was Behen Archipelago, where even high ranking users died.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What terrible things would happen in the future that he needed to ‘survive?’ Ordinary people would be extremely nervous and uneasy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Grid was the person who broke the sky above the sky. This created a high pride, and he wasn’t easily upset.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was only focused on the compensation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Challenger points? Is it something that only applies to certain areas?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Reputation was used as the currency in the Reputation Store.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What can I buy with this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was full of anticipation. He used Braham’s Boots and looked over the island from the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was to grasp the situation before the mission started.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Magic circle?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were four large magic circles engraved on the island.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What were they for?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Another person would’ve been able to grasp it more quickly, but Grid just had the intelligence of an ordinary person and only came up with an idea after a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Are they places where monsters are created?'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Since it stated that he had to survive for 20 minutes, it meant he would be threatened for 20 minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid guessed that monsters would pour out of the circles as soon as the survival mission started.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But he wasn’t fully convinced.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was to leave his mind flexible to cope with unexpected situations.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I have to prepare.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a few minutes left until the start of the mission.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In order to secure the minimum of safety and prevent himself from wasting mana, Grid landed on some rocks. He summoned the God Hands and gave them the strongest weapons, before moving them to the different magic circles.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Attack as soon as the enemy appears.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The four God Hands swung their weapons as if in reply to Grid’s command.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The first island’s mission has begun.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pak!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pa pa pa pat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A smile appeared on Grid’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was delighted that his expectations were correct.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Monsters were created at the four magic circles.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kieeeek!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kyaack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The monsters that emerged from the magic circles were the creepy sellobu.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It has been a long time.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sellobus.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were a spider type monster with low defense and stamina, but high attack power and speed. The sellobus were so fast that humans couldn’t counter.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were ghastly monsters that slaughtered players all over the continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Only level 200.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now Grid could destroy the sellobus in one blow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the God Hands were different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The God Hands only had 30% of Grid’s stats. In addition, his Sword Mastery was only beginner level 7.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had the most advanced weapons, but they couldn’t stop the sellobus instantly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It took them an average of three to four hits.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Too slow.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The speed at which the sellobus were created was much faster than the speed of the God Hands’ hunting.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their numbers started to get out of control and they shot poisonous liquid at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As expected of an offensive monster, their damage was flawless. The cumulative damage was a burden on Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'It’s a waste of experience, but it can’t be helped.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid used Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Transcended Link, to kill the sellobus around him, then pulled out his next method.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Noe, Randy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Snack time! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Randy, Grid okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe and Randy, who was in the form of Grid, appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid ordered the two of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Support the God Hands in the east and north. I will support the hands in the south and west.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe replied energetically, moving his wings and heading east.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, Randy didn’t know where the north was. However, he soon moved quickly when Grid pointed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to them joining, the east and north God Hands could quickly kill the sellobus.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid also wasn't idle.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He reached out his hands to the left and right and fired the Magic Missiles, assisting the God Hands that were suffering under the sellobus.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From this point on, numerous notification windows appeared in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have killed a sellobus.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[612,000 experience has been distributed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your pet Noe has acquired 204,000 experience.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your pet Randy has acquired 204,000 experience.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have killed a sellobus.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[612,000 experience has been distributed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your pet Noe...]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow, this is a big hit."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was astonished.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He killed almost four sellobus per second, so the speed of his experience gain was beyond imagination.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was around 10 times faster than the current best hunting ground, the vampire cities.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This wasn’t the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Sword Mastery of ‘God Hand’ has increased from beginner level 7 to beginner level 8.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Sword Mastery of ‘God Hand’ has increased from beginner level 8 to beginner level 9.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Sword Mastery of the God Hands grew at a tremendous rate as they wielded their swords without a break.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid trembled with something that was beyond joy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As the Sword Mastery level of the God Hands increased, the speed of the sellobu hunting became even faster, causing an equivalent rise in the speed of acquiring experience.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now it was 20 times faster than when hunting in the vampire cities.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have killed a sellobus.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have killed a sellobus.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have killed...]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The level of Noe has risen!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The level of Randy has risen!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The level of Randy has risen!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes! This is honey! Amazing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was so excited that he couldn’t help cheering.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The first island that frustrated so many challengers...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The land of despair turned into a great hunting ground for Grid.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have cleared the first island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have acquired 1 challenger point for the mission success.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Challenger Point]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Can be used to purchase items from the Challenger Store that exists somewhere in the Behen Archipelago.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah, too bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid ended up hunting for 20 minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He gained an extra 15% experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It would be nice if the mission was surviving for 20 days instead of 20 minutes... Or maybe 20 hours...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s heart wanted to take advantage of the first island. He wanted to repeatedly clear the first island so that he could catch up with Kraugel’s level.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was a stupid idea.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were still a lot of islands. Wasn’t it likely to have a better hunting ground later on?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'In the first place, I need to escape from here before I can do it again, and I don’t know how to escape.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid hadn’t yet fully grasped the system of the Behen Archipelago. He needed to be more careful.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He disciplined his heart and stepped onto the newly created bridge.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The gate to the second island was located at the end of the bridge.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have entered the second island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This island was at least 10 times larger than the first island.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The scenery was also different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was the sound of waterfalls from the lush jungle, as well as a small mountain at each end of the island. There were also lakes and caves.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh? Treasure chest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid looked around and noticed one place.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a towering rock wall just behind the starting point.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were 10 golden boxes shining brightly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this... No, is it a trap?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t act carelessly, unlike the past, and notification windows appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A mission will be created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Second Island]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Open the locked treasure chests!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There are 10 keys hidden throughout the island.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It is important to find as many keys as possible, as each box has a different key.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Time Limit: 3 days.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">First Clear Reward: Every time you open a box, 1 Challenger Point.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* If two or more boxes can’t be opened within the specified time, you will be expelled from the island.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The mission will start 30 minutes from now.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This time, it involves searching.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It seemed to be very difficult to find the keys if the time limit was three days.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Of course it’s hard.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The island was big and the terrain was too complicated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were bushes, lakes, waterfalls, caves, and cliffs all over.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had to find a small key in this place?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was no different from finding a needle in the desert.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Grid didn’t show any signs of being troubled. He still had a bright smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“The second island had the most dropouts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sticks observed Grid through the magic ball.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t have much expectations.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was true that the black-haired man broke through the first island in an extraordinary manner, but the difficulty of the second island was extremely high when compared with the first island.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"In order to break through the second island, you need the intelligence to bring together the different clues observed, without missing a single one. But...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The black haired man was sitting in front of the magic circle and just resting during the 30 minute preparation time before the mission began.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was wasting this time and not even looking for clues, so it was like the black haired man had already given up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I don’t have much expectation for him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sticks was surprised when he looked at the magic ball.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why was he so surprised?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Keok...! Keok keok.... N-No! Don’t tell me that person is a legendary thief?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sticks was bound to think so.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The treasure boxes that couldn’t be opened unless it was the right key, the black haired man opened them with one key in his possession. It was a dexterity that could only be admired.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"T-The second island in just 10 seconds...!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an unprecedented record.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the moment when Sticks, who was called a sage because he was wiser than anyone else, became a fool.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On this day, Grid reached the ninth island.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It also meant that Sticks was surprised a total of nine times.</span></p>
