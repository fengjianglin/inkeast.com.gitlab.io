 <p><span style="">Chapter 274</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Detecting the target. Predicting the risks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">These were phrases that described the insight stat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Before meeting Piaro, Grid had only used insight to measure combat power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">But in fact, insight was an absolute factor that could elevate his combat power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In other words, he could predict risks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You rat bastards!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He could read the enemy’s movements.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid didn’t easily allow Kamiyan to attack him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">He evaded or defended, then linked a counterattack.&nbsp;</span><span style="">These were movements that Piaro had taught him several times.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Keok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The efficient movements helped him draw out 100% of his abilities.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid dealt a strong punch.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“K-Kuaaack! You bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kamiyan couldn’t believe it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rather than overwhelming an opponent who didn’t have a weapon, he was receiving damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The difference between me and this guy is so large? Something is wrong...! It can’t be!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kamiyan believed that the empire was the whole world.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was indifferent to the happenings of small kingdoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, he had no idea about Grid. He only knew about the first time Grid came to the Vatican.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was just someone who ‘barely’ defeated ex-pope Drevigo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But what was the truth?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had experience raiding bosses much more powerful than Drevigo.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Under the guidance of Piaro, he had fought Pagma’s clone 83 times.&nbsp;</span><span style="">To be exact, Grid studied under Piaro, who was once the captain of the Red Knights.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wasn’t an opponent that the 30th knight Kamiyan could go against.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid provoked Kamiyan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Is your sword just a decoration? Isn’t it disgraceful that you can’t even subdue a bare handed opponent?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Shut up!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kamiyan lost his composure, then a gold spear suddenly flew and stabbed his chest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because his movements had become bigger after falling for Grid’s provocation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This gave an advantage to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The ‘Vital Spot Detection’ of the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch combined with his high insight to create an explosive synergy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At this moment, Grid was the person controlling the puppet called Kamiyan.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peok!</span></i> <i><span style="">Peeeeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The strongest martial artist, Regas.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It might be awkward, but Grid could follow his movements.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sometimes short, sometimes cool, his powerful fists stretched out nonstop.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The attacks that tenaciously aimed at the seams of his armor confused Kamiyan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Another five...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">When Grid punched once, his gloves intermittently emitted light.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Once that happened, Kamiyan felt like he was struck five times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the effect of the ‘5 Joint Attacks’ attached to Holy Light Gloves.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was actively relying on his items as always.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Swaeek!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Lifael’s Spear shot like a bullet every time there was a gap.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the pinnacle of the power of items, a reproduction of a divine weapon made of pavranium.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unlike Grid’s bare hands, it dealt damage to Kamiyan that couldn’t be ignored.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 3,830 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Okay, this time it struck properly.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Lifael’s Spear (Reproduction)]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: None</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Attack Power: 101~730</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Divine Power +200</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Fixed damage of +1,500 on each attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* There is a low probability of activating the ‘Light Wheel’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Attack power +20% against those with dark magic power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Maybe by the blacksmith G, who is being reborn as a true legend.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It is a miniature version of one of the three divine artifacts of the Rebecca Church, Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It is made from the legendary mineral with a a will, pavranium. Therefore, it has a strong tendency to protect its owner. It makes decisions and moves by itself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 14</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was no handgrip on the spear, so people couldn’t use it directly. So it wasn’t classified as a weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It might be due to that, or because it had divine power, but Lifael’s Spear was free from the ban on weapons.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid aggressively took advantage of it. Kamiyan became increasingly injured.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuaaah! Kill! I will kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Originally, Kamiyan was planning to play with Grid slowly. Now he became irritated and impatiently used a skill.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Papat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Kamiyan used Keen Senses and consecutively avoided Grid’s attack.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His sword drew several lines without a time delay. It was the manifestation of Dual Cross Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was only four strokes, but the quickly was comparable to Link. This was followed by a wave of energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The red light from Grid’s eyes darkened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His high insight was warning him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can’t avoid it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Should he fight back right afterwards?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No. Grid’s bare hands would only receive damage that way. It was too weak.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Crush it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid formed a fist.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Confronting an aura blade with his bare hands, it was crazy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kamiyan believed that Grid’s fist would be torn into eight pieces.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The millions of viewers watching the battle were the same.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was too arrogant to judge a legend by a moderate genius.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a reason for Grid’s behavior that the public couldn’t imagine.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The power of items.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment the cross sword collided with Grid’s fist...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Flash!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a light from the ruby ring Grid was wearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The option effect of ‘Dark Bus’ Earring’ is activated, neutralizing the target skill.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kamiyan was shocked!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Wow, what is that?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-The skill disappeared;;</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">No, in the first place, why is Grid’s control so good?</span></i> <i><span style="">How can he punch back against such quick swordsmanship?</span></i> <i><span style="">Is that really Grid?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">His agility is high.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-ㅇㅇ </span><i><span style="">It seems like his agility is maximized by his gear.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The viewers admired it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If I can’t avoid it, then I should use it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s expression shot through the magic ball was splendid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Take a good look.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s fist pierced through the cross sword and struck Kamiyan’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kamiyan staggered and Lifael’s Spear aimed towards him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid took out the Red Lightning Summoning Bead that he obtained from hunting the Frostlight Orc Chief in the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I am the master of the Overgeared Guild.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared Guild was the strongest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Don’t look down on us!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was a warning to the seven guilds who dared to invade Reidan while he was away. Then the red lightning bolt fell.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kurururung.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The red lightning bolt that fell from the sky was nestled in Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Additional lightning damage was added to the spear, which pierced Kamiyan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The red lightning adds 30% damage. The target has received an electric shock.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 17,300 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kamiyan screamed. It was the worst pain since the battle began.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now that he was in shock, it was a chance to deal a fatal injury.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid determined and activated Blacksmith’s Rage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rather than using Grid’s Boots that maximized the power of a greatsword, Grid equipped Braham’s Boots.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he wore the Hooded Zip Up. His movement speed was increased by 40%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-Wait a minute...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kamiyan begged as he was faced with the evil red light, but it was useless.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unbreakable Justice, the skill that was learned by rescuing Huroi and acquiring the title of Apostle of Justice. It was expressed through Grid’s fist.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kamiyan couldn’t even scream.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His head was struck and he was thrown into the smithy wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">His teeth were broken and blood covered the Slaughterer’s Mask.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Holy Light Gloves’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘5 Joint Attacks’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 7,020 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeok!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Cracks started to appear on the wall of the smithy above where Kamiyan’s head had struck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This scene was proof of Grid’s strength, which exceeded the level of a human.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But more than two-thirds of Kamiyan’s health still remained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the limit of bare fists.&nbsp;</span><span style="">First of all, Kamiyan’s health and defense was too high.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He won’t be defeated unless he dies.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was another Red Knight in the distance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid would take full advantage of the lazy attitude of the knight who stood on the sidelines without participating.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid would kill Kamiyan before the knight intervened.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s fists continuously punched Kamiyan’s face. Grid’s damage and speed were enhanced by Blacksmith’s Rage, so he completely neutralized Kamiyan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kamiyan used Super Armor and tried to get away from Grid, but Dark Bus’ Ring neutralized it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This bastard is a dragon!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The golden spear, fast moving boots, ring that neutralized skills, gloves that hit several times, armor with overwhelming defense, and so on.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was covered with artifacts that appeared in legends. It was like an imperial treasury was walking around.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Due to the short life span of humans, it was impossible to collect such artifacts in their entire life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kamiyan didn’t like Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the meantime, Grid’s punching continued.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The wall of the smithy completely collapsed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As the place to lean on disappeared, Kamiyan fell down and Grid’s knee hit his jaw.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Lifael’s Spear flew towards Kamiyan and wounded him,</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puoook!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Blood scattered all over the remnants of the smithy. It was a scene reminiscent of a battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-Wow...</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-God...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">This strength was beyond common sense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After the golem invasion, Grid had grown much more aware from the public’s eyes. He seemed to have also overcome his only weakness, control.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Items, skills, stats and now control, Grid was becoming truly perfect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I had to change my underwear.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I’m wearing a diaper.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">But isn’t a Red Knight weaker than the rumors?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">This is the 30th knight?</span></i> <i><span style="">It is said that they are strong according to their number.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">--ㅇㅇ</span><i><span style="">The single numbers must be a real wall.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">What? I was almost scared of Grid again.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I am scared.</span></i><span style="">ㅡㅡ</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">So that’s the 30th knight?</span></i> <i><span style="">Even other rankers can defeat him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">No.</span></i> <i><span style="">Grid is using his bare hands.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">What bare hands?</span></i> <i><span style="">He has the golden spear.</span></i> <i><span style="">Isn’t that a weapon?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">There were dozens of chat messages per second in the OGC web channel chat window. The chat administrators tried to restrain abusive users, but were forced to give up halfway.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, the TV channel’s ratings were exceeding 30%. The ratings soared in real time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was 6:20 p.m. on a Saturday.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was prime time with various popular programs, so this was a phenomenal record for a cable channel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Indeed, Grid’s power on audience ratings is beyond imagination.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was difficult to predict how the ratings would go up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there was one problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Isn’t this too cruel?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We will be hit with a warning. We might have to stop broadcasting for a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s battle style wasn’t good for minors to watch.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The opponent was an NPC, but Grid kept smiling as he hit the vital points.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was called a psychopath for a reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The team members were concerned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will take responsibility for everything. Don’t worry and keep broadcasting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His broadcaster’s blood was boiling.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would take responsibility for any repercussions, even if he needed to take off his clothes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would write a new legend in the broadcasting world.</span></p>
