 <p><span style="">Chapter 229</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">In the National Competition and golem invasion event, Grid proved to be the strongest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now two months of real time had passed after the golem invasion, so was he still the strongest?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 I don’t think so. 』&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 What’s the basis for your claim? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The performance of a third advancement class is far superior to the second advancement class. It’s on a completely different dimension. Most of the top 50 rankers have reached their third advancement class, so Duke Grid, who is immature in control, is no longer unique. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 I agree. Duke Grid overpowered the rankers in the National Competition with his items and class, but now he’s lost the advantage of his class. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 What if Grid overcomes his insufficient control skills? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Haha! The possibility doesn’t exist. Looking at it from a professional point of view, Duke Grid has no talent for control. The only advantage he has is his items. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The advantage will be offset by the fantastic control of the other ranked players. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As the information of the third advancement classes started to be revealed one by one, the experts started to criticize Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the first place, Pagma’s Descendant wasn’t a class specialized in combat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The experts were convinced that the third advancement rankers would be able to show skills well beyond Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the Second National Competition in Paris nine months later, Grid wouldn’t be able to win.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Ah, fans of Duke Grid, please don’t misunderstand. I’m not disrespecting Grid himself. He is a good leader who has absorbed the Tzedakah Guild, and also have talented people like Huroi, Lauel, Euphemina and Ruby. 』&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 I also know that Duke Grid’s blacksmith skills are great. However, we are currently analyzing Duke Grid’s combat ability, so we have to criticize it. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In fact, Satisfy experts had a grudge against Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because their analysis of Grid during the National Competition was wrong and they were embarrassed in front of the public.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It would be nice if Grid’s era ends quickly.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I don’t want to discuss Grid anymore. It’s embarrassing every time my analysis is wrong.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Would these wishes come true?</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">"Sura Charge!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">After converting to an Asura, Regas’ combat power was twice as high as a martial artist.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The enemy was confused by the punching and kicking changing trajectories, then he would dominate the battlefield by linking lightning and dark skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The sight of him facing four giant worms simultaneously was excellent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He’s stronger than when I won the duel. Has he completely adapted to his new class?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Nobody can call Regas a Taekwon Master now. Sooner or later, he will be called a war god.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As Grid and Lauel admired him, the spear knight aboard a camel started moving.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk!</span></i> <i><span style="">Puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Rumble!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kiyack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A spear knight’s attack power increased when riding on a ‘mount’ such as a horse or pet, so it was a spectacular sight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even the monsters in the west were unable to cope with his blows.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was impossible to kill the western monsters in one blow unless they were Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon soon faced five giant worms.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was this a crisis?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Gatling Spear.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The sonic spear moved several times in a fan-like range.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the five giant worms became rags and transformed into light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Great.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Gatling Spear exerted a power comparable to Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Kill. Unlike the single-target Kill, it was a wide range attack.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was filled with admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have higher stats than Pon and the performance of Failure is much better than Pon’s weapon...'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Nevertheless, the difference in passive skills was too great.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Combat classes all had the passive skill of Weapons Mastery, which had the effect of adding attack power. Meanwhile, Grid had a clear limit since he relied exclusively on Pagma’s Swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Pagma’s Swordsmanship Lv. 2 (89.9%)]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-When the skill is deactivated-</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You can become one with the sword at any time. Increases physical attack by 30%, critical hit rate by 20% and critical damage by 10%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* This effect is only applied when a sword type weapon is equipped.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The skill consumes no mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-When the skill is activated-</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Become one with the sword. Wave, Restraint, Link, Kill, Transcend, Transcended Link and Linked Kill You can unleash a total of seven sword techniques.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The effect of the deactivated skill will be lost.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* 20 mana is required to activate the skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Once deactivated, it will take 10 seconds until the skill can be activated again. Nothing will be consumed when deactivated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pagma’s Swordsmanship had a fatal weakness.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The effect of the passive skill disappeared when he used an active skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The effect of a 30% increase in attack power, 20% increase in critical hit rate and 10% increase in critical damage wouldn’t be applied to skills like Kill and Link.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'The passive skill only applied to the base damage... This is the limit of the class called Pagma's Descendant.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Grid wasn’t worried. Rather, he was overflowing with confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Right now, Regas and Pon’s strength might seem comparable to me, but that’s only for the moment. That gap will increase again the moment I reach level 300.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was an old saying in games that ‘levels were bullies.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">That saying was also established in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">10 stat points were gained every time the level increased, and users would become stronger as their stats increased. It wasn’t just because of simple reasons like wearing better items or getting stronger skills, but also due to the unique function of stats.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">For example, the strength stat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A level 200 user’s strength stat had 0.3 attack power, 7 health points and a weight limit increase of 40 with every point.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A level 300 user’s strength stat had 0.4 attack power, 9 health points and a weight limit increased of 50 with every point.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In this way, the effect of the stats increased every 100 levels. This was called the stats awakening.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The sum of the level 275 Grid’s stats were currently higher than the stats of the level 300 Overgeared members. Looking at the total number of stats, Grid’s level was nearly 380.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He went through a process called minus level, obtained special titles, and produced countless items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What if Grid reached level 300 and received the third stats awakening?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The difference between our passive skills only applies for now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The source of Grid’s power was his overwhelming stats.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was more familiar with this than anyone else, so he didn’t have to be nervous about the growth of others.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If I complete the Grid set then...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was the strongest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huhuhu...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why all of a sudden?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid smiled and Lauel felt a shiver. It was like encountering a monster on the level of a demonkin.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Huroi shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“My Lord! Seven basilisks are present 800 meters to the south!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members were nervous.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Seven basilisks?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“We should bypass them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The respawn rate of the western monsters was unusually fast. If a battle lasted for an extended period of time in one place, they would end up surrounded by monsters.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The basilisk was one of the strongest monsters in the west, so it was obvious they would face a crisis if they had to fight seven of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There is a small mountain to the west. It might delay our journey, but we can bypass the monsters.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I don’t want to.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid ignored Lauel’s advice and grabbed Failure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I haven’t hunted in 131 days. I will use this opportunity to increase my experience.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The desert was a harsh terrain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Every time they moved, their feet sank into the sand, severely limiting their movements.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members were experts in combat and already adapted to the desert terrain, but what about Grid?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members were worried.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s dull movements and lack of combat sense meant it was impossible for him to exert his full power in the desert.&nbsp;</span><span style="">So they were going to move first to clear any monsters they encountered on the journey to their destination.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But what was the truth?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jebeok jebeok.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was armed with heavy boots and walked in the desert like it was a plains area. He even sped up and ran.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was due to the thorough education from Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What has gotten into Grid…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members doubted their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kiyaaak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A basilisk noticed a human running over and opened its mouth. Then the light of petrification that also caused great damage flashed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a skill that was hard to respond to because the range of the light was wide and fast.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members were sure that Grid would suffer great damage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid lacked control skills, so he was always hit by monsters. They thought it would be the same again this time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Have I only fought you once or twice?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had moved to Reidan from Patrian.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had been taught by Piaro and killed numerous basilisks, so he already predicted this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was able to accurately estimate the timing of the flash and fired Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Wave to offset it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he approached the basilisk that was slowed, used Blacksmith’s Rage and stabbed the basilisk in its weak eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kiyaaaaaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The basilisk struggled from the pain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Suddenly, the six other basilisks surrounded Grid and swung their tails.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“My Lord!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members paled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If the six basilisks attacked at the same time, Grid would definitely die.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid was already in the rear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He avoided four tails flying from the front, and defended against the other tails using the pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjeejeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kieek?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The basilisks were confused at the appearance of the golden blades that blocked their attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They felt danger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because they saw the black eyes of the human in the gap between the golden blades, looking at them like they were prey.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One of the top predators of the desert was prey?&nbsp;</span><span style="">This human was dangerous.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The basilisks were instinctively engulfed in fear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“First one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid stepped forward towards the basilisk that he had attacked first.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The heavy weight of Grid’s boots made the desert sand run loose.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Grid’s greatsword, which had a different power than before, struck the basilisk’s wounded eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This wasn’t the end.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid evaded the basilisk’s subsequent counterattack and triggered Pagma’s Swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The sword followed the movements while he evaded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The blue greatsword reminiscent of an ocean predator penetrated the skull of the basilisk.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuwaaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">One of the seven basilisks instantly turned into a grey light.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members couldn’t close their mouths as they watched.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is that Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The control skills that Grid used at this moment weren’t particularly outstanding. Anyone who played the game could show such movements.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But who was Grid?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was mocked by everyone for having poor control skills. This person who wasn’t talented was taught the skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He overcame the weakness in himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Has Grid always been working where we couldn’t see him?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘How much effort did he put in?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'This is truly my lord! I am proud!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No, aren’t you going to help me? Aaaaack!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">While the Overgeared members were feeling thrilled, Grid was becoming bloody due to the other six basilisks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The party window showed that his health gauge was exponentially dropping.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members freaked out as they saw it and hurriedly moved to save him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, Piaro observed Grid’s battle from beginning to end and clicked his tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Really, there are no signs of improvement.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner heard Piaro’s voice and shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This farmer isn’t sane either.’</span></p>
