 <p><span style="">Chapter 169</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Hell?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He never wanted to go there.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Won’t there be more guys like Hell Gao in hell?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The demons were too strong. He also didn’t want to fight them again, because the dropped items were too bad.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'No, it was a misunderstanding that the dropped items were bad.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid watched the grinning memphis who was licking his fur with a red tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘An amazing pet dropped. Hell Gao was the most powerful boss I’ve faced. I might’ve only obtained two fire stones, but I was able to get a tremendous treasure in return for raiding him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Memphis]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The most powerful species among the thousands of demonic beasts inhabiting hell.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As an adult, their fighting abilities are superior to the higher-ranked demonkin, so they are the favorite of the 33 great demons.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But they are a species in danger of extinction, due to their lack of breeding ability.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Their natural habitat is hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I managed to obtain such a precious pet and I ignored it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid reprimanded himself and brought up the status window of his pet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Name: Not Set</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level: 1 (0/200)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Affinity: 0/100</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Health: 5,000/5,000</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Physical Attack Power: 60 &nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Attack Power: 30</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Defense: 50 &nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Resistance: 80</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Attribute: Dark</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Status: Narcissistic</span></p>
 <p><span style="">(As soon as I was born, I ate a human soul with my own strength! I am the best demonic beast of hell! Nyang!)&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-Current Skills List-</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Fluidization]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">When attacked, the body can become fluid like a slime to minimize damage. However, the damage from some attribute magic might become even greater.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Soul Ingestion Lv. 1]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Has the ability to take away half of the target’s highest stats and transfer it to your master.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: Your own decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Scratch Lv. 1]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Your paws will attack and poison the target.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: Whenever you like.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He gained zero experience points from defeating Yoshimura, so is it impossible to gain experience from PK? Anyway, his abilities at level 1 are terrific. The skill called Soul Ingestion is a complete scam.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The fact that the skill cooldown time depended on the memphis was quite annoying, but he would take it step by step.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid laughed with joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Master, do you like me? Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The memphis was great.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid made a pleasant expression as he looked at the cat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Sehee likes cute things like this. I’m worried because she has no hobby other than studying... Should I buy her a capsule?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The memphis’ eyes in the shape of a ‘ㅅ’ looked sweet and cute even to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He thought about buying his little sister a capsule, because he wanted to show her the memphis.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid quickly nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, I like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Of course you do! I am elegant, beautiful, and powerful. I am the best demonic beast of hell! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pisik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The memphis’ big and round eyes narrowed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he sniffed and spoke words that stabbed at Grid’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"But I don’t like Master.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh? Why?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You are ugly! I don’t like you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Take a look twice~ can’t~ unsee~ it~~ nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Recently, Grid hadn’t been hearing that he was ugly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had built up confidence, so there wasn’t anyone who became sick or tried to run away when he smiled at them. Therefore, he was shocked to hear that he was ugly from a cat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then the memphis tried to comfort him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Don't worry! I won’t abandon you because you’re ugly! You can be ugly! Master just needs to entertain me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The cat should honor and serve his master, yet he was asking for his master to entertain him?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'This damn cat, does he not know the meaning of the words Master?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s expression distorted while Peak Sword laughed at the sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It looks like a cat, but its nature is different from a cat. Won’t you be struggling in the future?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Well... I can tolerate some things if I have this pet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The first way to build affinity with a pet was to name it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid worried about what he should call the memphis.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If it was a dog, not a cat with wings, the name Dog would be perfect...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was there a name he could give to this prideful cat?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid thought of an appropriate name.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Slave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Nyang?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Your name is slave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kyaak!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Padak padak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The memphis flapped his wings hard around Grid and bristled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Master’s naming sense sucks!&nbsp;</span><span style="">How can a noble beast of hell be a slave?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Master is crazy! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was surprised to see that the memphis had even extended his claws.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This cat doesn’t know the meaning of the word master, but it knows the meaning of slave?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If affinity entered into the negatives then the pet could escape.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid wanted to prevent the worst so he quickly changed the name.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You heard wrong. It isn’t slave, it is Noe, Noe.” (TL: Slave in Korean is pronounced like Noye)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Noe?"&nbsp;</span><span style="">The memphis was confused.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“What does Noe mean? Nyang?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid replied roughly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"A slave is a slave... Noe means you are not a slave.... That is what it means.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oh...! Ohhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The memphis’ wild eyes became lanterns again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a demonic beast of hell, he had a lot of knowledge after being born, but he was still just a kitten.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He felt like there was something wonderful and cool about Grid’s words.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And then...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Good! I am Noe! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He felt better and rubbed his cheeks against Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid laughed at the poor little guy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay! With this, your name is Noe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Do you want to set the memphis’ name to ‘Noe’?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Yes.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The memphis’ name has been set to Noe.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Affinity with Noe has risen by 5.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The memphis raised a paw to his engorged belly and shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You are Master and I am Noe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Correct.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid made a serious expression and raised his thumb.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Memphis. No, Noe was satisfied! He laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword saw this and clicked his tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Giving that name to a demonic beast...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid truly wasn’t an ordinary person.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After that, they left the dungeon and headed for Cork Castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh! The return of the heroes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You cut down Yoshimura?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The guild members praised Grid and Peak Sword, who had defeated Hell Gao and the Sakura Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They tried to question Grid, but were stopped by Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He didn’t register in the rankings, so he probably doesn’t want the public to know that he is Pagma’s Descendant.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword had keen insight as the head of an organization, so he didn’t spill Grid’s identity. He highlighted that they succeeded in the Hell Gao raid because of the fire stones weakness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">During the night.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid enjoyed a banquet and built up a friendship with Peak Sword and the Silver Knights Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Some guild members caused a fuss after they became drunk, but fortunately it ended without anything serious happening.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The next day.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the early morning, Peak Sword carefully asked Grid who was preparing to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You aren’t participating in the National Competition this year?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid nodded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"A strange woman put down my name on the list of participants, but I have no intention of participating. I don’t want to expose my identity, and there isn’t much merit to participating.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes. But I hope that you change your mind next year. As a man, fighting for the honor of your country isn’t a bad experience... I will participate next year, so let’s join together.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will think about it then. As a reservist, I am already in the arduous position of striving for the security of our country.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid went out to the terrace. He savored the smell of salt on the wind and told Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Please let me know if Hell Gao responds normally during the next cycle. I need one more fire stone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I understand. But as I said yesterday, Hell Gao probably won’t appear for a while. He’s likely to be replaced by other high ranking demonkin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I guess I’ll have to look forward to it. Then I’m going now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid immediately used Fly. Then he flew away from the island and disappeared into the horizon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword watched Grid and thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'The greatsword with fraudulent attack power, the golden blades, the invisibility cloak and now the boots with Fly magic attached to them... Amazing. This game truly is about items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">To be honest, he was really envious.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I want to obtain items like that soon.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then Grid’s voice entered his ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">If you have a request to produce an item, please contact me.</span></i> <i><span style="">I will add you to the schedule.</span></i> <i><span style="">Of course, it's a paid service.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He could request the production of an item from a legendary blacksmith!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword shook with joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Thank you Grid!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The two people rapidly became closer after sharing secrets.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban was waiting at Khan’s smithy as Grid returned after six days.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s face, which had been happy since obtaining Noe, stiffened as soon as he saw Toban.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Good work! Did you obtain the fire stones?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid looked at Toban’s expectant expression and pulled out two fire stones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...I am lacking one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban had already predicted this situation since Grid said ‘Believe in me.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he couldn’t help feeling disappointed as it was proven true.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid apologized to the frustrated Toban.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I'm sorry. I did my best, but Hell Gao was too strong. It was impossible to focus on mining.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban panicked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Why are you apologizing? Is it something you should be apologizing for? I’m just grateful that you tried.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">To think he would apologize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid really had changed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He felt like a completely different Grid compared to the one Toban first met.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Can people mature while playing the game?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Anyone could become strong if they levelled up. That was all. The level up system wasn’t one designed for people to grow internally. So how could Grid change in this way?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban thought it was a miracle.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"In the past four months, Vantner had put his stat points in stamina and he can now play the role of tanker. Even if I don’t have the Fire Shield, there’s a chance we can succeed in the Phoenix Raid with him. So don’t worry about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Then I'm glad. I will keep these fire stones for the Fire Shield production.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, thank you. By the way, why did you ignore Jishuka’s whisper?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Jishuka?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was confused.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Jishuka never whispered me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“On the day you left for Cork Island, Jishuka kept whispering to you, but there was no response."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid looked through his memories and nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ah, I was busy with flying that day and ignored some whispers. It might’ve included Jishuka’s whispers. But why was she trying to contact me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“She wanted to ask for your home address...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“My home?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“She came to South Korea and wanted to meet you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hrmm...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid thought about it and was sad to miss the opportunity.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The guild members who came to South Korea because of this National Competition was Jishuka, Pon and Regas, so it was a chance to meet all of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I definitely want to meet them... If I don’t meet them this time, I might not get another chance?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Wouldn’t he regret it someday if he missed the chance to appreciate Jishuka’s fantastic body, who made hundreds of millions of won for taking pictures for a few hours?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid checked the time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It will be the second day of events in reality. What events is Jishuka participating in?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Target processing and the siege. And it seems like the last one is treasure hunting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The second day... It is the day with target processing and siege.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The National Competition was everywhere when he turned on the TV, so Grid couldn’t help memorizing the schedule.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Maybe I should go there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He said goodbye to Toban and logged out.</span></p>
