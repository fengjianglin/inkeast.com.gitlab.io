 <p><span style="">Chapter 336</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Indeed, my grandchild is great! He doesn’t cry when doing a poo, he’s a real man! Just like me!"</p>
 <p><span style="">"It’s good if you’re dexterous like me. He is also pretty like Irene, and smart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ha! He’s perfect! It is almost a perfect work by God! Giving birth to such a great son, I respect you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I admire the man who helped give birth to a lovely woman like Irene!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kelkelkel!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hahaha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid and Marquis Steim made a fuss as the maid changed Lord’s diaper.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The great lords who represented their nation had forgotten their dignity.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Irene was somewhat disgruntled, but didn’t say anything. She didn’t want to break their excitement because she understood their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Lord is sleepy. We shouldn’t interrupt his nap time, so we should go out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“T-This... I want to play together a bit more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Father is right. Don’t you know how important sleeping is for a child when growing up? We shouldn’t prevent him from sleeping."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...It can’t be helped.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sleep well, Lord. Chu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Grid couple left the child to the nanny and left the room with Marquis Steim.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It happened when the nanny fell asleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Somebody fell from the ceiling.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was done secretly with no sound.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The sleeping nanny and knights guarding outside didn’t notice the appearance of the visitor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was natural.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The man with dark skin and long arms was none other than Kasim, king of shadows.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How many people could detect Kasim’s stealth?&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were only a few throughout the continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He’s cuter up close.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Originally Kasim was protecting Irene, but now he was by Lord’s side.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most nobles cherished their heir more than their wives. Grid was the same, so Kasim changed his protection priorities.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Once he’s older, he will attract many women.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The last 10 days.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kasim was amazed as he watched Lord.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the first time he had seen such a beautiful and clever newborn. Kasim didn’t share a single drop of blood with him, but he was glad to watch.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If it wasn’t for the empire...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He would be able to marry a Nero woman, have a child, and live a normal life.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaduduk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was at this moment that Kasim’s desire for revenge on the empire was revived.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Suddenly, the sleeping Lord opened his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The newborn baby detected him when the nanny and knights outside the door couldn’t.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kasim was thrilled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘His innate senses goes far beyond an ordinary person.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Abu! Abu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lord reached out to Kasim. There was clearly a smile in his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It felt like he was just looking at Kasim.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Does he know that I am guarding him?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This baby was the real thing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kasim, the strongest assassin currently in existence.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He became greedy when he saw the transcendent genius.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Little boy, do you want to play with me every night from now on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Abu! Abu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His eyes shone like they had lanterns. It seemed like an answer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kasim smiled with satisfaction, picked up the block pieces and arranged them on one side of Lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Throw this. Like so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kasim demonstrated directly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He threw a block and hit one of the dolls placed on the window frame.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Tok!</span></i><span style=""> After seeing that the doll fell, Lord laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But with the baby’s control, the dolls were still too far away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Bubu! Bu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lord waved his arms when the block he threw wasn’t able to reach the window. His pride seemed to be hurt that he couldn’t match Kasim.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kasim thought it was absurd.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A newborn baby is aware of my words and is also burning for victory...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Also!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘His strength is already better than most boys!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The block that Lord threw was very light. In order to throw it towards the window, he needed the strength of a 14 year old.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Lord was still 0 years old.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kasim’s enthusiasm grew.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This child’s innate senses and power!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I might be able to impart the completeness of the secret techniques Master left behind!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doran and Kasim were slightly lacking in talent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They could only learn half of their master’s secret techniques.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘But this child...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lord Steim.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the day he met the first of his seven mentors.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">"Oh my!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The nanny woke up and felt like she had been hit by lightning.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because the formerly clean room now had blocks scattered around it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Was it the young Lord?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A newborn baby climbed down from bed and played with toys?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was nonsense, the nanny was well aware of this. But if someone had entered the room, the knights outside the door would’ve called out and woken her up. She was forced to suspect Lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lord was in a deep sleep.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His sleeping form was consistent with when she last saw him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Lord is sleeping, so what happened?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She got goosebumps. It seemed to be a ghost.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, Kasim was shocked from his spot on the ceiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A newborn baby is pretending to sleep!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was amazing.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The desert had been turned into a field.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soldiers freaked out as the hot desert turned into a golden wheat field.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow... What is this?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Am I dreaming right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 2,000 soldiers were confused at the unbelievable situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is this sudden scene?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bunny Bunny was angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What’s the point of making a field? It’s in vain!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent rushed towards Royman.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Uh!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Royman barely defended against Hurent’s blow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A blue light aimed at her waist.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Aura Impact, which he used to create another blade and attack through the gap.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is the end!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Royman felt sure of her death.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She closed her eyes as the aura blade flew at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is there more than one life? Fight to the end and don’t give up so easily.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He seemed to be busy with the wheat field, but he ran to protect Royman.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sir Piaro...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Royman looked at Piaro different after her life was saved again. She was full of longing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But she couldn’t look into Piaro’s eyes for long. She was embarrassed and shyly bowed her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A person of talent who had just started to walk along his path.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was no need to feel ashamed for being powerless against the strong.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He spoke words of comfort,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I will add two hours of planting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro had no mercy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He turned towards Hurent after reducing Royman’s sleeping time to 3 hours and 30 minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent was smiling despite his attack being blocked. He could afford to relax.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I heard that a crazy farmer was the guardian of Reidan. I’m embarrassed, since I didn’t expect it to be true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You seem quite amused for someone who is embarrassed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Of course I’m amused. What if I defeat the farmer who stopped the seven guilds from reaching Reidan? Won’t my evaluation soar up infinitely?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t put impossible words in your mouth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“We’ll see. I know the long and short of it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It seems like you believe in the 2,000 soldiers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No, I only believe in me."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttaak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent snapped his fingers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was it a signal for the soldiers to attack?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro thought so, but the soldiers didn’t move.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Uh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro was puzzled as Royman suddenly groaned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because she started to feel pain from her side, which had been lightly grazed by the aura blade.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“My aura left a mark.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Mark?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes, a mark where aura can manifest. Imagine it. If I release aura from your lover’s side, what will happen to your lover? She is so fragile that she will break in two.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was certainly upset.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent smiled with satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Now, make your choice. Allow my army to advance! Or I will break your precious lover apart in front of you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent shouted with confidence towards Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is that a mark that can be carved into the ground?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What? There was no tension in that question.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent was confused and nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"T-That’s correct. It is a technique with a high utilization.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hoh.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ssik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A smile appeared on Piaro’s face. He looked very wicked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Won’t this be useful for clearing the fields?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Clearing the fields?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">What was this?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent couldn’t understand the words and frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro copied his style of speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will give you a choice. Work in the fields with me. Or do you want to work in the fields after losing all 2,000 soldiers?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No, what nonsense is he saying?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Wasn’t Hurent the one in an advantageous position right now?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was like talking to a wall.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent realized it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He was called a crazy farmer for a reason!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This farmer truly wasn’t sane.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent determined and triggered the skill to let Piaro know his position.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kyaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Royman couldn’t bear the pain coming from her waist and sat down. Her side was already soaked with blood.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro saw it and shouted,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“You have chosen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Free Farming 8th Style. Polishing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reason why Piaro left Hurent alone and cleared the field.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because his enemy wasn’t just Hurent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro was thinking about the big picture.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pepepepeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The wheat field that covered the whole area.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Explosions occurred where the 2,000 soldiers and Hurent were standing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The myriad of wheat had become powerful bombs, destroying the whole area.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent was at a loss for words as he saw the soldiers screaming and dying.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A ranged skill that could target 2,000 people?&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was equivalent to the Meteor skill that could only be learned by a legendary great magician.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Don’t tell me, a legendary...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro approached the astonished Hurent and wielded his hand plow.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 15,500 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 15,900 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 16,100 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered catastrophic damage in a short period of time! You are in a critical condition!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘T-This is crazy!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was this?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent was hit successively in the forehead by a hand plow and sat down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The sight behind Piaro was a mountain of bodies and a river of blood.</span></p>
