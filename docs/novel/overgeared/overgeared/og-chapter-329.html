 <p><span style="">Chapter 329</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The Young Ladies High School’s Satisfy fighting competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This part of the school festival was a hot topic of interest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The 16 participants were celebrities in their field and it was a chance to see Saintess Ruby.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In fact, tens of thousands of people were watching the match on the Internet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Eh?</span></i> <i><span style="">Why is Go Jimyung’s ID red?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">He isn’t in sparring mode.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Wow, look at that jerk Go Jimyung trying to kill Sehee.</span></i> <i><span style="">Is he crazy?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">He has gotten into many incidents since dating Reina, and he’s alienating his fans.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">This is why you should meet a good person...</span></i> <i><span style="">ㅉㅉ What are the organizers doing?</span></i> <i><span style="">They’re just letting it play out?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">This XX, trying to kill our Saintess!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The public weren’t fools.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The viewers saw that Go Jimyung was intentionally trying to hurt Sehee.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the Young Ladies High School didn’t do anything to stop the match.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The audience and viewers condemned the Young Ladies High School and Go Jimyung, but their cries didn’t work.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If they didn’t help Sehee, she would eventually die of her wounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Magic Missile."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">One of Satisfy’s greatest users, he appeared without warning to punish Go Jimyung.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Did anyone blame him for breaking the rules of the competition?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The audience and viewers all cheered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Truly God Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword felt joy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Magic Missile. The Magic Missile fired fired from the middle finger crushed the other person’s body and mind.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The ruthless attitude of Grid towards the enemy was very exciting to Peak Sword. A truly dependable colleague.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At this moment, five people approached him. They were solid men dressed in black suits.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had a menacing atmosphere around them, so Peak Sword became alert.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You will be arrested for lewd conduction, including sexual assault.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? Sexual assault? Lewd conduct? Me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword was dumbfounded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t understand what these people were rattling on about.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“In the first place, are you even capable of arresting people? You aren’t the police.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“We might not be the police, but we have the power to capture criminals on this campus and transfer them to the police.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No, I don’t know what you are talking about? Why am I being treated as a criminal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ah, perhaps?&nbsp;</span><span style="">A scene passed through Peak Sword’s brain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the miracle of Moses that Grid caused.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hah, truly.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had become Grid’s patsy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is unfair.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword wanted to be honest. The molester was Grid, not him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Peak Sword couldn’t sell out a friend.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t speak honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Catch him!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The guards hired by the Young Ladies High School were elites in their field.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They boasted excellent physical strength and athleticism.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword wanted to cry out as he was dramatically chased by them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why is it like this?’</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘T-This... How did this happen?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Go Jimyung couldn’t understand the current situation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid suddenly appeared and he fell into a critical state after being hit by two Magic Missiles?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The confused Go Jimyung fell down as Grid stopped in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You dare to beat up my sister? What type of guy are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was uncontrollable rage in Grid’s sharp eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Go Jimyung watched Grid’s magic power concentrating and felt fear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was he worried that he would be killed and drop experience and items?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he invested time and money, he could recover this experience and items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Go Jimyung was afraid of his girlfriend, Reina’s, rage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She asked him for this favor, so would she be disappointed and want to break up?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was horrified just imagining it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was thinking about how to stop his death and suddenly shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Stop! If you touch me then you won’t be safe! I know gangsters!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Gangsters?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid jumped.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was helpless in reality, unlike the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t easily overcome Go Jimyung’s threat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘You lousy bastard.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid hesitated when he suddenly recalled Beast Master Toon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had been active in Overgeared since the days of the Tzedakah Guild, but wasn’t he in the mafia?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was also constructing a building in Korea like the other guild members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A wicked smile appeared on Grid’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You know gangsters?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes! He is very cruel!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is he worse than the Italian mafia?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? The mafia?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, the mafia. My friend is part of the mafia!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid spoke arrogantly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Go Jimyung was dumbfounded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A friend was in the mafia?&nbsp;</span><span style="">What type of bluff was this?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Crazy bastard!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Go Jimyung shouted at him,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"If that is true then kill me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t hesitate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Magic Missile."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Keook...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Once again, a white flash emitted from the middle finger pierced the head of Go Jimyung.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Go Jimyung realized his mistake.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This guy really has a friend in the mafia...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have died.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have lost 18.7% of your experience and the Flaming Mace (Unique).]</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuaaah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Go Jimyung sprang out from the capsule.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t a problem to lose experience or items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was afraid of Reina and he was also furious.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was killed in front of thousands of people using Magic Missile!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I won’t forgive you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Go Jimyung kicked out angrily. He looked around and ran towards the capsule where Grid was sitting.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, he tried to.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shouldn’t you act more moderately?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Go Jimyung’s face distorted like he was a demon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kim Doohyun.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A world star and Reina’s old love.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The man who was an eyesore was now blocking his way at this crucial moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“If you don’t want to be injured then get lost!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Go Jimyung was once the greatest batter. In particular, his arm and shoulder muscles were very developed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most people avoided his eyes when he spoke in a threatening manner.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Kim Doohyun was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He stood in front of Go Jimyung with a silent expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Go Jimyung made a fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eek?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Go Jimyung’s head shot up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">With the benefit of hindsight, he realized that Kim Doohyun’s elbow has hit his jaw.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"T-This...!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Crash!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Go Jimyung was shocked at being pushed back, while Kim Doohyun whispered in his ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Go and tell Reina this. ‘The reason I’ve been ignoring your actions is because you’re still young. But now that you are an adult, you will be held responsible for your own actions.’”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“K-Kuack...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to the his natural strength and athleticism, Go Jimyung was a king in his school days.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After graduating from university, he made his professional debut and had never had a shameful day like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘You damn...! You will see one day!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Go Jimyung became weak and fell unconscious.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid, who was spying on them from inside the capsule, ran outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He is really stunned!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid ran to check Go Jimyung’s state and kicked him. Now he felt relieved.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Then.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid glared at Kim Doohyun.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Did you make Go Jimyung do this so that you can look cool in front of Sehee?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kim Doohyun was able to realize why Grid was hostile to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He heard that I am a high school girl killer.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doohyun spoke bluntly,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I participated in the festival in an attempt to meet Sehee, so that I can meet you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid still didn’t relax.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Doohyun took out his smartphone, entered Noe’s fan cafe and showed it to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Look at this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was this?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid remained alert while checking the screen of the phone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he became aware of Doohyun’s true identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Member ID: Noe’s Slave</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Member Rating: Best Member</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doohyun bowed and begged,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Please accept me into Overgeared!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Your level?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Well... I have recently been busy so I didn’t have much time to play the game. I’m level 190.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was he unqualified to join Overgeared?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Doohyun’s earnest expression was very different from his usual image.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s anger disappeared and he now felt sympathy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Level 190 is pretty good?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid thought again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Your class? If you are a production class then I will consider letting you join the guild.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I’m not a production class, but a pet master... A unique class. Is it not possible?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid grabbed Doohyun’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Welcome!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“There’s less than a month left.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was how long King Wiesbaden of the Eternal KIngdom had left to live.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The 1st Prince, Ren’s, face darkened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wasn’t mourning his father’s death.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was afraid of the monsters living in Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The golem invasion of Reinhardt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Ren still remembered the words of Duke Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I, Grid, swear eternal loyalty to Your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He swore</span> <span style="">allegiance to King Wiesbaden, not the royal family.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was like a declaration of war towards the 1st prince, so Ren was always afraid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I must strike first.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ren watched the situation of Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He knew that Reidan currently only had 1,000 troops.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There won’t be another opportunity if I don’t strike now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ren made up his mind and hurried to his palace.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he called the strongest warriors that he’d invited from all over the continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I want you to join my army that will conquer Reidan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’ll willingly do it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The warriors answered without hesitation, including a grey haired middle aged man.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His name was Hurent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was the one who lost to Grid in the 1st National Competition in just 5 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The quest is in progress.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent checked the notification window in front of him and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid, I will pay back the humiliation in the past.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent’s eyes were filled with confidence.</span></p>
