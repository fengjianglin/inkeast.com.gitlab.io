 <p><span style="">Chapter 153</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The jade fire was a symbol of the demonkin.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was beautiful enough to tempt the soul, but the reality was that it could even melt steel.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Hwaruruk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Every time Balak’s sword moved, fire flashed in the air and a path of fire was made on the ground. The whole area was suddenly covered in fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Damn, he’s as scary as Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The center of Bairan Village.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was a black man running away from the ruins of collapsed buildings that were as dark as his skin color.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'So fast.'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The shape of the demonkin Balak was no different from that of humans. He had a slim body like an adult male.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But his skin was boiling like lava. Two big white eyes were above a mouth that curved from ear to ear. The hair was burning so it was really like looking at the image of a demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The ghastly demonkin caught up with the humans at a transcendent pace and swung his elongated sword.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The fire sword cut at the thick outer wall of a building like it was a radish.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban would’ve been literally cut in half.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban groaned as he defended with his shield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His face seen over the jade fire was distorted with pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This bastard’s passive skill is too threatening.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He barely managed to defend, but his health kept steadily declining.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The flames that spread out 1m around Balak spun rapidly and caused continuous damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s fixed damage, and fire resistance is useless, so it’s definitely a headache.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The damage dealers couldn’t approach.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The fire caused 500 damage per second, so it was a huge burden for level 250~260 damage dealers who had a health of around 19,000.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Toon had a high amount of health but he couldn’t see an opportunity. He couldn’t easily move.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Right now, the party was hoping that Toban, their tanker would make an ‘opportunity.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Toban had to fight alone for a while.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kaang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kakakang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is the attack speed becoming faster?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban was using all the buff skills he had.&nbsp;</span><span style="">All the numbers listed in his status window had risen from a few percent to tens of percent more than usual.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was impossible to defend against Balak’s sword forever.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The fastest speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban couldn’t resist the sword swinging at his chest.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Seokeok!</span></i> <i><span style="">Sakak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 3,900 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have been hit by a lethal blow!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 7,980 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The fire sword penetrated through his shield and blood spurted from Toban’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Flop!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban let out a terrible scream and fell to his knees, making Balak smile.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Balak swung his sword again, as if he wanted to end this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moment that the sword was shifting orbits.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban used a skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Swamp Shield!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Papat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A thick shield made of slimy mud suddenly emerged in front of Toban.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The fire sword wielded by Balak clashed with the shield. Then it was sucked into the swamp.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Trying to use a trick.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The sword wasn’t pulled in.&nbsp;</span>The tighter Balak held on, the more the sucking power increased.&nbsp;<span style="">Annoyance filled Balak’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It would be easier if you obediently become a slave of the death god (Yatan)...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The demonkin’s voice was simultaneously transmitted to his ears and his brain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Anyone who heard it would feel fear and confusion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the opponent was the first paladin of the Judar Church. He wasn’t deceived by the demonkin’s voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Good bye."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Toon and seven other Tzedakah Guild members attacked at once.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Do it quickly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Balak had a passive that dealt continuous damage to all enemies within 1m of him. The longer they fought, they more disadvantageous they would be. They needed to attack in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Counterattack.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Fox Fire Queen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Sword of the Moon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Brilliant Strike!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Frost."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Vacuum Wave!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The top 100 damage dealers of the unified rankings used their ultimate skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toon stood out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elephant, rhino, hippo, bear, lion, tiger, jaguar, eagle, snake, wild boar etc!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Toon transformed into all types of different wild beasts and precisely struck at Balak’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Lord’s Strike!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the moment when the beast master, a rare hidden class, dealt 1350% of his physical damage.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuaaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The energy of the beasts smashed into Balak’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Balak’s sword was being sucked into the Swamp Shield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He failed to defend properly and coughed up blood.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the skills of the remaining six guild members hit him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Flaming fists, a sword that seemed to slash the space itself, flashing lightning, frost that could freeze bone and a spear all struck quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were all powerful skills that dealt more than 1100% of their attack power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the sound of Neberius’ flute was the problem.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Three of the six skills were non-targeted skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their accuracy dropped by 60% so they failed to damage Balak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The guild members were perturbed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Balak, who had been knocked down after four successive hits, stood upright again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he roared,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Hell Fire Festival!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hundreds of fireballs revolved around Balak! They burned and expanded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Doesn’t this seem dangerous?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Move back!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was too late.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The guild members tried to get as far away from Balak as possible, but the fireballs was already causing a series of explosions.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pepepeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was like a fireworks festival.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuaaaack!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were hundreds of explosions around the guild members, causing them to fly back in pain. In particular, Toban suffered a great wound and was in a critical condition.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Crack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">At that moment, the duration of Swamp Shield ended. Then Balak’s sword was freed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Balak picked up the sword that fell to the ground and his sharp teeth gleamed as he laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This time, I will invite you to the sword festival.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Stupid cubs who used non-targeted skills... Cough! Spit! If you hit rate is reduced, you have to use certain skills you fools.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shit... Damn... Why are you so confident... Shut up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The guild members were turned to rags from the explosion and started swearing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the end.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Everybody had a hunch.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban felt despair.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘I couldn’t hunt because I was caught by Grid and now I will die and lose experience...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the result of his incompetence.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After this, he would try harder to level up and become stronger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was around the time that Toban was making a pledge.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Who is above level 250, has more than 1,800 strength and has advanced Sword Mastery?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A voice was heard from the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were glad and annoyed to see him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What, this bastard? What are you saying all of a sudden? Kyaaack~ spit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toon expressed all their feelings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Toban grinned as he looked up at the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The most powerful user that Toban knew, Grid, appeared like a magician.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The new members, including Toon, didn’t recognize him because he was wearing a hat, but Toban and the other old guild members knew him instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was because Grid normally wore scruffy clothing when working at the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid, what are you saying? Level? Strength? Mastery? Why are you asking that?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hey, stop talking nonsense and come down to help.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The guild members grumbled. But they were happy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pagma's Descendant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The appearance of the legendary class gave them confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I want to lend you a weapon. I will ask again. Who is above level 250, has more than 1,800 strength and has advanced Sword Mastery?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Toban is over level 250 but the other conditions...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The guild members looked at each other as Grid asked again. There were some who met one or two conditions, but none that seemed to meet all three.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that moment, Toon raised a hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid identified him and frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I don’t like that bastard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toon listened to Grid’s words and finally realized his identity.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I also don't like you. Kyaaack~ spit! You are a coward who lied that you are a blacksmith.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Whatever, take it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid threw Toon a black greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the sword that the butcher, who Toon wanted to fight, used. In other words, it was the weapon that Grid had been using for a long time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Toon recognized it at first glance and asked,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Are you crazy? Why are you giving me your weapon? Do you plan to fight with your bare hands?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid snorted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Do you think that garbage is my weapon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“G-Garbage?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toon thought it was ridiculous after checking the details of the +5 Dainsleif (Reproduction).&nbsp;</span><span style="">This enormous item that could be called the strongest weapon in existence was considered garbage?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What’s wrong with that bastard? Ah, that's right. Isn’t he originally like this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The butcher was known for being a psychopath.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Toon released the wristblades that he had been using for a long time. He equipped Dainsleif and used the ‘Half Man Half Beast’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ku...ooooooh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The muscles of his body expanded like the Hulk. Then grey hair started to grow on his thickened skin. He grew a snout like a wolf and his teeth became longer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was like a werewolf.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid checked the changed Toon and sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There is no creativity... Hey, if you like that sword then buy it from me. The price is four million gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Awooooo~!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Wolf... No, Toon howled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he rushed towards Balak and started to wield Dainsleif.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Toon combined human abilities with the power of a beast, making him much stronger than before. In addition to that, Toban and the other guild members supported Toon with buff skills, so Balak couldn’t help feeling confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“How can a human be so strong...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This place can endure a bit more...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid tied up Balak’s feet for a while after throwing Dainsleif.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he turned his gaze 80m to the rear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He saw an elderly man playing a flute with one hand, while dealing with Faker and Ibellin with the other hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I should first stop that old man playing the flute.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The magic power from the flute was ringing all over Bairan Village.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is the end of that old man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid put his hand into the inventory.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Saaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A blue light emerged in the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Another greatsword emerged from his inventory.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It looked like a shark.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It maintained the dignity of a predator.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Transcended Link.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ku kwa kwa kwa kwa! Ku kwa kwa kwa kwa!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t know it, but he was at the center of the world’s attention.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A total of 20 strikes was launched, dealing 150% attack power with each hit. They were fired without a time difference.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...What?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Neberius cried out as he was dealing with Faker and Ibellin.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A heavy rain of swords poured down from the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Neberius’ eyes widened at the sight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t just Neberius.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The overwhelming attack astonished the world, including the Tzedakah Guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dark Fire Storm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Neberius pulled out an orb. He summoned the most powerful magic of three attributes that were combined in the orb.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The fire storm collided with the blue energy swords.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Avoid it!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a huge explosion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Tzedakah Guild noticed and spread out instantly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">18 of the 20 swords were offset by Neberius’ storm.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, two swords persevered and threatened Neberius.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This mighty force...!”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Neberius admired it and stopped playing his flute for the first time. He hurriedly used magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Dark Ice Wall!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">An ice barrier was instantly created. Its height was much taller than Bairan Village’s walls.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwakwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The two energy swords were blocked and destroyed by the barrier.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kururung.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">As a result of the impact from the collision, sparks flew and aimed at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Danger!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ibellin had already felt the power of the black flame and was worried about Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid was fine.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The black flames were destroyed by a flashing Golden Shield, then Grid descended towards the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sharp flashing eyes could be seen from between black hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwajik!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kwajijijik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Dozens of dark thunderbolts fell and hit Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he was fine?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eek...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Neberius freaked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The effect of the Holy Light Armor has been activated, resisting the dark magic.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid smiled as he saw the notification window.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After the dark thunderbolts were gone, there was a red lightning strike.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pachik!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pachichik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">An intense spark!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The strongest skill!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A power equivalent to a nuclear bomb fell towards Neberius’ head.</span></p>
