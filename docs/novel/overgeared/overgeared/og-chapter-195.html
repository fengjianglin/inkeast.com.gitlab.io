 <p><span style="">Chapter 195</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Humanity started to receive news through smartphones dozens of years ago. Nevertheless, newspapers still had a steady consumer base.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The full subway.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Some passengers were holding newspapers in their hands. The newspapers were published by different places, shown by the different political stances.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the newspapers all had the same headlines.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Golem Army’s Attack on the Eternal Kingdom!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One month after the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There hadn’t been any special incidents in Satisfy, except for the fact that Kraugel was the first user to get a third advancement class.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Internet was in an uproar.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Why the Eternal Kingdom?</span></i> <i><span style="">The Eternal Kingdom is neutral, so there shouldn’t be any countries hostile towards them?</span></i> <i><span style="">What kingdom sent the golems to the Eternal Kingdom?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">There are 17 kingdoms on the continent.</span></i> <i><span style="">They all have their own interests, so even a neutral kingdom isn’t guaranteed to be safe.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">To be able to send so many golems, isn’t it impossible for one country alone to have that strength?</span></i> <i><span style="">It is impossible to control that many golems unless dozens of great magicians join forces.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Wow!</span></i> <i><span style="">Then several countries have united to attack the Eternal Kingdom…?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Is this the precursor to a massive episode?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">No matter how high their numbers, golems are golems.</span></i> <i><span style="">How did the Giant Guild get smashed by the golems?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris’ level was 298 and he had the dignity of the third ranked user.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The seven captains were top ranked users over level 260, and the average level of the 700 Giant Guild members was 180.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was honestly unbelievable that more than 1,000 golems with a maximum level of 200 could one-sidedly massacre the Giant Guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As the world became increasingly confused, footage started to be shown around the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 This is a video of the Eternal Kingdom war that we just obtained. Watch this video and you will see how bad the Eternal Kingdom’s current crisis is. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The screen that switched.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Through this war, our Giant Guild will take one step further. Record this glorious moment carefully.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The video started with Chris talking to the camera.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuuong!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kuwuong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The massive sound of footsteps shaking the ground was clearly heard from far away.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The viewpoint of the camera, as well as Chris and the guild members’ eyes, moved towards the horizon.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuoooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">One, two, three. Tens, hundreds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Over 1,000 golems were slowly but surely approaching from the horizon. They gradually came closer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The appearance of the golems lined up was truly spectacular. It was like a ridgeline.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The size of the golems varied. The names were also very unusual.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were around 1,000 ‘old golems’ that didn’t look much different from existing golems, and 200 small golems with the same body shape as humans called ‘soul dolls.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Finally, there were 12 extra large golems exceeding 8m in height and 4m in width that were called ‘ancient weapons.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The names are great.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris spoke warily.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Based on the names alone, they seem much stronger than existing golems. In particular, those super-sized golems and humanoid golems.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The magician Asellas, one of the seven captains and a specialist in petrification magic, came up with his own opinion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The humanoid golems look very difficult. We should take care of them first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The advantages of a golem were their high physical defense and health. Instead, they were vulnerable to magic and relatively slow, making them easy to deal with.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was clear that if the humanoid golems had the existing strengths of a golem and were fast, they would be hard to deal with.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Asellas’ comments quickly convinced Chris.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay. Take care of the humanoid golems.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">From then on, a splendid magical bombardment began.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Asellas and 200 magicians attacked the humanoid golems with their most powerful magic.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">An explosion occurred in many parts of the wilderness and a dust storm rose.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The camera became blurry and nothing could be seen in front.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They suspected that the powerful magical bombardment would completely destroy the 1,000 golems.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After a while, the dust storm lifted and everyone was astonished.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The golem army was completely fine.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They didn’t even suffer minor damage from the magical bombardment of Asellas and the other guild magicians.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Asellas’ face turned white.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Anti-magic Shield...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Anti-magic Shield was a spell that blocked all types of magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a perfect counter for magicians and classified as S-grade magic, so it wasn’t something that everyone could use.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the golems were using Anti-magic Shields.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Asellas stared blankly at the pink transparent shields deployed by the 12 super-sized golems.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No way. How is this possible?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The golems could use magic? In addition, it was S-grade magic?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Giant Guild couldn’t understand it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, Asellas and the magicians lost their morale.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I used all my mana...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I used all the magic stored in my orb...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We couldn’t even do any damage...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What should we do if the golems are immune to magic?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Giant Guild’s morale rapidly deteriorated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The golem army continued to advance and was gradually getting closer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris hurriedly ordered,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“We will change the target to the super-sized golems.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The magicians were useless as long as the super-sized golems used the Anti-magic Shield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That’s why Chris decided to deal with the super-sized golems first, but it wasn’t easy.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuwaaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The physical damage dealers and tankers tried to attack the huge golems, but the old golems blocked their way.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their appearance was similar to general golems, but they weren’t ordinary.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“These damn things!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris and the damage dealers charged at the golems with their large, prearranged weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the defense of the golems was uncommon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their attacks didn’t work as they wanted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They felt much more solid than the hardest iron golem.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris realized that the situation was worse than he thought.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He smashed a golem using his strongest technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have destroyed an old golem.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[350,300 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the case of a monster that was already hunted, the level and details could be grasped.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris used this basic system to verify the information of the old golems.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Old Golem]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level: 240</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A relic of the past. A golem made of volcanic rock mixed with black iron, making it harder than an iron golem. Existing magicians can’t produce this level of golem.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Dammit!'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Existing golems had a level range of 50~200.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the old golems were level 240.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t a big deal for Chris and the seven captains, but they were too hard for the general guild members to deal with.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Every three people organize into one group to fight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The average level of the Giant Guild was 180. He judged that three members would be able to deal with one old golem.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the problem wasn’t the old golems.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The real crisis started once the 200 humanoid golems entered the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeok!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kwakwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"H-Hik!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The guild members were logged out in front of the swift and accurate attacks of the humanoid golems.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The perplexed Chris ordered the seven captains.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We will mark the humanoid golems! Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The strength of the humanoid golems transcended common sense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Not only were they fast, but their combat skills were very good.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Some of them wielded their fists and feet like a martial artist, while others used parts of their bodies like swords or spears.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even the seven captains found it hard if they were attacked by two or more humanoid golems.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were 200 of them.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris defeated a humanoid golem and confirmed the details.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Soul Doll]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level: 280</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A battle doll made by capturing the soul of a warrior. The ego isn’t maintained but the soul can demonstrate its original life’s fighting skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is this fraudulent..!?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The strength of the soul dolls was at the level of a field boss.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What type of magician created these monsters?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris got goosebumps.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The battlefield was disadvantageous.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Magic shields didn’t help because of the Anti-magic Shield, and most guild members were too busy dealing with the old golems.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The seven captains were unable to cope with the pincer attacks of the soul dolls.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It had been less than 10 minutes after the fight started, and half of the guild members had already been logged out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is finished.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The S-rank guild quest exceeded common sense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris realized this and shouted angrily,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“These damn pieces of scum! I will smash one more of you before I die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soul dolls came from every direction.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris wielded his greatsword at them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The third ranked user didn’t fall down easily.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Over time, all the guild members were logged out, but he survived and defeated hundreds of golems.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he wasn’t invincible. Soon after his stamina was depleted, he left the battlefield. Then he could only helplessly scream as the golems destroyed Pedro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The war footage switched back to the news studio.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The hosts and experts appeared with a serious expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The biggest reason Chris was defeated in his match against Regas was because he was careless. As he proved now, Chris is much more powerful than what he showed in the National Competition. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 That’s right. He’s stronger than Regas, and not weak. But that alone can’t stop the golem’s advance. It’s sad. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 In particular, the soul dolls are too powerful. Chris was only able to defeat four soul dolls. The ancient weapons are extraordinary, but they didn’t directly participate in battle. Who is the creator of these mighty golems? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The old golems and ancient weapons... Based on their name, they seem to be a heritage of the past. Maybe it is the legacy of the great magician Braham. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Braham? Aren’t you thinking too much? Even if the creator of these golems is Braham, what type of magician can control Braham’s golems? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Perhaps the golems are made by Braham’s disciple. Well, it will be revealed gradually. Right now, the key question is whether or not the Eternal Kingdom can withstand the attacks of the golems. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The military power of the Eternal Kingdom is very powerful. That’s why they could exist as a neutral kingdom. But that is a story of when it is a human against human battle... They might be helpless against the golems. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Then there is only one conclusion. Users, please leave for the Eternal Kingdom right now! It’s a great opportunity to get a quest that will give you enormous rewards! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The users and guilds already knew this and were moving towards the Eternal Kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style="">King Wiesbaden of the Eternal Kingdom gave a wide range of quests to prevent the unprecedented advance of the golems.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Fight the Golems]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Difficulty: B~S</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Giant Guild was brave enough to defeat the golems that crossed the border of the Eternal Kingdom, but were eventually defeated. As a result, the southern part of the Eternal Kingdom was destroyed and the golem’s army is advancing towards the capital of the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">King Wiesbaden senses the crisis and summoned his troops from all over the kingdom. He is asking you to cooperate with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Conditions: Repel the golems.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Rewards:</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After defeating an old golem, 300 gold and 100 kingdom contribution will be acquired.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After defeating a soul doll, 1,000 gold and 500 kingdom contribution will be acquired.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After defeating an ancient weapon, 3,000 gold and 1,500 kingdom contribution will be acquired.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">100 gold was worth 120,000 won.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In addition, accumulating 3,000 kingdom contribution could earn the user the title of a baron, and 10,000 contribution gave the title of a viscount.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From the users’ perspective, there was no reason not to join this quest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From all over the continent, tens of thousands of users gathered in the capital of the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Everyone! I have a party! We must make a party to defeat the golems!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In Satisfy, up to 24 people could join one party. The users formed parties and went to war.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But could regular users handle the soul dolls that even the seven captains of the Giant Guild had difficulty with? It was a useless defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Most parties barely managed to defeat one or two old golems, but they were easily destroyed by the soul dolls.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Anti-magic Shields didn’t allow magicians to exert their power, so the battlefield went badly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">And.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuweeeeeoh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Hundreds of users were logged out when the ancient weapons occasionally fired a massive ray of magic energy, causing the Eternal Kingdom to face a crisis.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The users didn’t want to continue any further, forcing the Eternal Kingdom to fight against the golems with their own soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">King Wiesbaden was furious.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What wicked person? Why? What purpose is there behind giving this trial to my kingdom?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, a grocery store in the capital.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Two girls was pushing through a crowd, struggling to get anything done.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I chose this place because I heard it was the most comfortable place for beginners to start, but what is this? We can’t go hunting because of these big stones, so we can’t do anything until the capsule room booking time ends.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The ID of the complaining girl was ‘Sexy Schoolgirl’.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a fairly childish name, but her face was really pretty. She actually was sexy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her name was Park Yerim in reality.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was the best friend of Grid’s younger sister Sehee.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sehee was the neat girl standing next to her.</span></p>
