 <p><span>Chapter 281</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <hr>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>Earl Chirita’s third son, Pascal.&nbsp;</span><span>He was well aware of the world’s unreasonableness, just because he was born later in the line of succession.&nbsp;</span><span>Did he feel frustration and resentment against the world?</span></p>
 <p><span>No.&nbsp;</span><span>Pascal tried hard.&nbsp;</span><span>After looking for a path, he endured the trials and only served Goddess Rebecca.&nbsp;</span><span>As a result, his fate changed.&nbsp;</span><span>He could soon become pope.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Now it is my turn to reign!’</span></p>
 <p><span>He was ready to enjoy the end of this unreasonable world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Then Grid intruded.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Grid! You ruined my life!’</span></p>
 <p><span>He felt resentful. His heart felt like he was going to burst. Blood was ejected from his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Kuaaaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Pascal’s resentful gaze penetrated Grid as he started turning grey.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid knew that curses were contained in that gaze.&nbsp;</span><span>But Grid wasn’t afraid.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Curse? Try it if you want.’</span></p>
 <p><span>He had already lived and overcame a life of hell.&nbsp;</span><span>Even if this curse opened up a new hell, he could overcome it.&nbsp;</span><span>It was the firm belief of the growing Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span>"This guyyyy!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Pascal witnessed Grid’s unshakable eyes and couldn’t hide his anger even as he disappeared.&nbsp;</span><span>The scream echoed through the room, then new notification windows appeared in Grid’s field of view.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>[You have defeated pope candidate Pascal, who has caused heartbreak to numerous people.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[725,477,950 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>...</span></p>
 <p><span>...</span></p>
 <p><span>The amount of experience was a huge 720 million!&nbsp;</span><span>Pascal gave a truly huge amount of experience as a high level named boss.&nbsp;</span><span>But Grid wasn’t satisfied. He seemed disappointed.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I thought it would be at least two levels.’</span></p>
 <p><span>So far, Grid always gained multiple levels every time he raided a boss.&nbsp;</span><span>But now he was level 296, so things were different. &nbsp;</span><span>The problem was that the amount of experience needed to level up dramatically increased.&nbsp;</span><span>Despite having gained over 700 million experience points, the experience gauge wasn’t even half full.</span></p>
 <p><span>This was an unexpected result.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Now it’s impossible to raise my level with raids alone.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid had made giant leaps in level by hunting bosses alone, but now there was a limit to that method.&nbsp;</span><span>Now grinding mobs was required.&nbsp;</span><span>Prepare potions, go to hunting grounds, kill monsters and repeat.&nbsp;</span><span>It was time to experience these repetitive tasks.&nbsp;</span><span>Of course, the first hunting targets were...</span></p>
 <p><span>“Heok.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The 16 remaining elders flinched as they met Grid’s greedy eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>“All of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The ‘Blackening’ effect that belonged to the Dark Bus’ Earrings could only be used once every 12 hours.&nbsp;</span><span>The duration was five minutes and the cooldown time was 12 hours.&nbsp;</span><span>Unlike White Transformation attached to the divine artifacts, the Blackening built into this one artifact was incomplete. It wasn’t efficient.</span></p>
 <p><span>Now Grid couldn’t rely on demonic power.&nbsp;</span><span>He faced the 16 elders with pure power.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Holy Missile!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Holy Wave!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Great Heal!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The elders tried to resist Grid.&nbsp;</span><span>Their determination not to suffer like Pascal amplified their concentration. Their spell casting speed was faster than before.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Link!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid had acquired one of the hidden pieces ‘Sealed Ability’ and his skills cooldown time was reduced by 10%.&nbsp;</span><span>Now he was able to use Pagma’s Swordsmanship more often.&nbsp;</span><span>After swiftly slashing at two elders, he finished with Unbreakable Justice. &nbsp;</span><span>This was followed by Kill.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Puok!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Despite his companions using Heal on him, the elder coughed up blood on the Hooded Zip Up.&nbsp;</span><span>He looked stunned at the blue greatsword piercing his chest.</span></p>
 <p><span>“K-Kuack...!”</span></p>
 <p><span>[You have defeated the corrupt elder Haiber.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[45,908,230 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Your demonic power has increased by one.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[You have defeated the corrupt elder Sairus.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[46,441,000 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Your demonic power has increased by one.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[You have defeated the corrupt elder Raid.]</span></p>
 <p><span>...</span></p>
 <p><span>...</span></p>
 <p><span>The experience of third advancement priests was terrific. It was at least 10 times more than normal monsters.&nbsp;</span><span>It was possible because they were semi-named NPCs.&nbsp;</span><span>It was pleasing for Grid, but the actual situation wasn’t good.</span></p>
 <p><span>After Blackening was gone, Grid didn’t deal much damage to the elders.&nbsp;</span><span>It was impossible to hurt them without using a skill.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid was stuck with his skills on cooldown, so the elders were able to hold on with Heal, while aiming attack magic at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Pepeng!</span></em></p>
 <p><em><span>Pepepepeng!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The bombardment of light continued.&nbsp;</span><span>The number of wounds on Grid increased. The Holy Light Armor was dyed with blood and became rags.</span></p>
 <p><span>'This can't continue.'</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid determined and recalled the pavranium that was protecting the prostitutes.&nbsp;</span><span>It was an unavoidable choice.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Jjejeong!</span></em> <em><span>Jjejejeok!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The golden spear started to assist Grid.&nbsp;</span><span>Sometimes it defended Grid, sometimes it attacked the enemy, doubling Grid’s attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Kuaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Lifael’s Spear broke the Holy Shield and the Grid attacked, lowering the health of the elders.&nbsp;</span><span>He took mana potions and used skills whenever the cooldown ended, dealing with the elders one by one.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘It is hard to endure!’</span></p>
 <p><span>The faces of the elders were panicked.&nbsp;</span><span>In the first place, priests were more suitable for secondary roles than fighting at the front. Their ability alone couldn’t deal fatal injuries to Grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>"Ohhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid’s rampage grew increasingly wild. His physical abilities far exceeded the elders.&nbsp;</span><span>Of course, there was a moment of crisis, but Doran’s Ring saved him.&nbsp;</span><span>5 seconds of invincibility and Doran's ring.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was like Grid had three lives.&nbsp;</span><span>It was a fraudulent combination of his class and items.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Dammit!’</span></p>
 <p><span>There were eight elders left.&nbsp;</span><span>They eventually used the worst means. They took the prostitutes trembling in the corner as a hostage.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Don’t move a single muscle. If you move, I will kill them”</span></p>
 <p><span>Innocent prostitutes.&nbsp;</span><span>They witnessed a scene of slaughter and were now being threatened.&nbsp;</span><span>It was regrettable.&nbsp;</span><span>The elders smiled as Grid hesitated.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Indeed, it worked!’</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Now we just need to hold on until the paladins arrive!’</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid had protected the prostitutes with the golden spear.&nbsp;</span><span>Thus, the elders assumed that he cherished the life of the prostitutes.&nbsp;</span><span>But.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Kill them.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid once against started walking.&nbsp;</span><span>He didn’t care that the power of the elders was aimed at the prostitutes.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I won’t receive any damages even if they die.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Of course, he felt bad.&nbsp;</span><span>This was a moral issue.&nbsp;</span><span>He might be called a psychopath, but who would accept an innocent person being swept away by the turmoil he caused.&nbsp;</span><span>Thus, Grid did his best.&nbsp;</span><span>He took care not to damage the prostitutes and supported Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span>That was enough.&nbsp;</span><span>He didn’t want to fail the quest because of them.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘This is better.’</span></p>
 <p><span>The prostitutes were witnesses.&nbsp;</span><span>As the witnesses who saw Grid hunt Pascal and the elders, there was concern that she would bear testimony against Grid.&nbsp;</span><span>It was better for them to die instead of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Step, step.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The frightened elders cried out as Grid approached.</span></p>
 <p><span>“D-Don’t come closer! I really will kill them!”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Yiing.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The power in the fingertips of the elders pointed towards the prostitutes became stronger.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid snorted.&nbsp;</span><span>“Kill them?”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Teong!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Grid leapt forward.&nbsp;</span><span>The eyes of the elders widened as Grid drew his sword.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I really will kill them!”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The bodies of the fearful prostitutes were swept away by an explosion of light.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid’s eyes sank as he identified their ashes.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Wave.”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Chaaeng!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>A wave of energy hit the eight elders.&nbsp;</span><span>Their speed fell and they were cut by the blue sword.&nbsp;</span><span>After around 10 minutes of fighting.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Pant... Pant...”</span></p>
 <p><span>Now there was only Grid and Earl Chirita left in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span>“P-Please! Please spare me!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Earl Chirita staggered and begged as he approached Grid.&nbsp;</span><span>He witnessed the helpless Pascal and the elders, and was half insane.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid spoke coldly,&nbsp;</span><span>"I told you. I’m the only one who will survive here.”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Puok!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>“Cough...!”</span></p>
 <p><span>[Earl Chirita of the Saharan Empire has been defeated.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[3,110,400 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[2,000 gold has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Your demonic power has increased by one.]</span></p>
 <p><span>"This is another unexpected harvest.”</span></p>
 <p><span>2,000 gold.&nbsp;</span><span>It was 2.4 million won.&nbsp;</span><span>Earl Chirita dropped a huge amount of gold from his luxurious clothing.</span></p>
 <p><span>[The time attack quest ‘Evidence Destruction’ has been completed!]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Rumors about you won’t spread to the Saharan Empire!]</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kurururu...</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Due to the aftermath of the battle, the room started to collapse.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid identified the sinking ceiling and cracking pillars, before hurriedly leaving this place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>"Master! Why do you look like this? Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid escaped to Isabel’s room.&nbsp;</span><span>Noe worried about him as he lay on the bed.&nbsp;</span><span>It was because the atmosphere around Grid was dark.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid stroked Noe’s head while feeling guilty about the prostitutes who died because of him.</span></p>
 <p><span>"It isn’t a big deal.”</span></p>
 <p><span>He forgot this fact sometimes due to his love for Irene, but this was ultimately a game world.&nbsp;</span><span>It was good to cherish NPCs, but this could also be a poison.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid controlled his heart. Then he looked at the items Pascal dropped one by one.</span></p>
 <p><span><span><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnoteref-1"></a></span></span></p>
 <p>[One <span id="footnote-1">Goddess' Essence.]</span></p>
 <p><span><span><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnoteref-5"></a></span></span></p>
 <p>[5 <span id="footnote-5">Blessed Weapon Enhancement Stones.]</span></p>
 <p><span><span><a href="#footnote-7" id="footnoteref-7"></a></span></span></p>
 <p>[7 <span id="footnote-5">Blessed Armor Enhancement Stones.]</span></p>
 <p><span><span><a href="#footnote-11" id="footnoteref-11"></a></span></span></p>
 <p>[11 <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; float: none; display: inline !important">High-rated Magic Stones.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Pascal’s Secret Warehouse Key]</span></p>
 <p><span>No equipment items dropped.&nbsp;</span><span>It was somewhat disappointing, but Grid was satisfied enough.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Goddess' Essence]</span></p>
 <p><span>It was an essential material when making the three divine artifacts of the Rebecca Church (Reproduction).&nbsp;</span><span>It was only a small amount of essence, but he was happy that Pascal dropped it.</span></p>
 <p><span>[High-rated Magic Stones]</span></p>
 <p><span>Each one was worth 4,000 gold and could be used to make magic items.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>‘The more enhancement stones I have, the better.’</span></p>
 <p><span>None of the items dropped by Pascal were unrecognizable.&nbsp;</span><span>Among them, Grid was particularly interested in a golden key.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Pascal’s Secret Warehouse Key]</span></p>
 <p><span>The key to opening Pascal’s secret warehouse.</span></p>
 <p><span>There is a mountain of gold and silver piled up in Pascal’s warehouse.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Mountain...!’</span></p>
 <p><span>How many riches were there for it to be described as a mountain?</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I will become rich!’</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid rose up excitedly.&nbsp;</span><span>Then he received a whisper from Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span>-</span><em><span>It is a mess out here!</span></em> <em><span>Someone has killed Pascal and the elders!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>-</span><em><span>I killed him.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>-</span><em><span>Huh?</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Grid asked the puzzled Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span>-</span><em><span>Do you know the location of Pascal’s warehouse?</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Damian was absent minded for a moment, before replying belatedly.</span></p>
 <p><span>-</span><em><span>Warehouse...?</span></em> <em><span>I don’t know, but Pascal always uses the first prayer room.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>‘The first prayer room.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid didn’t delay. He ran straight towards the first prayer room.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Clink.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>He opened the warehouse door by inserting the key.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Swaaaaah!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The brilliant gold light filled his field of view.&nbsp;</span><span>It was painful to the eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Amazing...”</span></p>
 <p><span>Gold was really piled up like a mountain inside the huge warehouse.&nbsp;</span><span>It was the epitome of a dragon’s lair.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Is this all mine?”</span></p>
 <p><span>If he took all of this, he would have tens of billions of won.&nbsp;</span><span>He was so excited that his sphincter muscles contracted.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Puhahaha! I will be rich! Rich!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The joyful Grid!</span></p>
 <p><span>The notification window that popped out was like lightning out of the blue.</span></p>
 <p><span>[The safekeeping system of the secret warehouse has failed to detect Pascal’s divine power and has activated.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The warehouse will explode after three minutes!]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Gather as much riches as possible in three minutes.]</span></p>
 <p><span>“Dammit!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Things were going to well.&nbsp;</span><span>What should he do to get as much gold as possible in three minutes?&nbsp;</span><span>Grid thought hurriedly as he poured gold coins into the mouth of the confused Noe.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Summon Knight.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The system that he never used when he was a crisis, in order to save experience, was triggered.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I have responded to My Lord’s call.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Please give a command."</span></p>
 <p><span>“Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Piaro, Asmophel and 10 members of Overgeared emerged from the light.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid shouted,&nbsp;</span><span>"Get the money! Money!”</span></p>
 <p><span>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span>Their historic first mission, after being the pillars of the empire in the past, was to pick up gold coins.&nbsp;</span><span>Complex emotions crossed Piaro and Asmophel’s face.</span></p>
