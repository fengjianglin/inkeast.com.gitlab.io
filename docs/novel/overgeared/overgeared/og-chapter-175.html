 <p><span style="">Chapter 175</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">When he was a highschool student.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lee Junho only believed in his fist, and tormented children weaker than him. Mental and physical abuse were basic, and he also extorted money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">In school, he was the king.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No one could resist and had to obey him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">One of the tormented was Shin Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would shiver when frightened and would become grumpy if his pride was trampled on.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo was the same, even after going to university and the military.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lee Junho mocked him every time they met at the alumni meeting.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But what was this?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The person who appeared at this year’s reunion was significantly different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was economically successful and confident.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, Lee Junho hadn’t changed from his school days.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t abandon his gangster mentality and couldn’t adapt to society. He was in his late 20’s and could only find part time jobs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lee Junho became ashamed of himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He got off the throne he was sitting on and faced reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I need to change, like Youngwoo.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lee Junho was determined.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Like Youngwoo, he tried to overcome his past self in order to achieve a new and successful life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">First of all, he abandoned his futile pride.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He worked hard to find jobs at gas stations, convenience stores, PC Cafes and construction sites.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t boast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t spend much money. He saved one penny, two pennies, and eventually realized something.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How wasteful was it to rob others of money with violence?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He also realized it every time he was ignored by the customers for being a part-time worker.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He believed that the act of ignoring the weak was a sin that shouldn’t be forgiven.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘...I’m sorry, Shin Youngwoo.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On his way back home after his part time job.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lee Junho was smoking in a smoking booth and apologized to Youngwoo in his mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was a bitter smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If I could have an opportunity to apologize to you, I will never show up in front of you again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Satisfy National Competition was relayed on billboards on skyscrapers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was able to see Youngwoo’s appearance there.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now he was a person in a completely different world.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Many people stopped along the way and looked up at Youngwoo on the billboard.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Among the crowd was Youngwoo’s sister, Sehee.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cool.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yerim was with Sehee and sincerely admired him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was completely fascinated by Youngwoo, who appeared to save Yura and overwhelm the foreign teams.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“He is capable, strong and overflowing with confidence. Your brother is really the best man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The game and reality are different. I admire my brother, but he isn’t the best man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee tried to return Yerim to reality, but it was useless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Aren’t you aware that Satisfy isn’t a simple game? Satisfy is already another reality. He is the best man in that reality.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yerim knew it more accurately than Sehee.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She had a more mature appearance than her age and proclaimed with a giggle,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I will surely have your brother.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Gulp.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The men starting around them were attracted to Yerim and lost their souls. There was the sound of gulping here and there.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Several men who looked like gangsters were already approaching. Sehee glared at them and asserted to Yerim.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You don’t fit Oppa’s taste.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yerim’s eyes widened. She looked at Sehee’s sulky expression and laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Sorry, sorry. Sehee, I forgot how much you love your brother. I’m sorry for making you jealous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m not just saying this. You really don’t fit Oppa’s taste.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ye~? What man would dislike me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yerim was considered the best queen of South Korea’s high school system along with Sehee, so her self-esteem was very high. Sehee explained the reason for her confident words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oppa likes busty girls.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yerim tilted her head to one side. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Aren’t I pretty big?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You need to at least have a D cup.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the billboard, Youngwoo was saving Jishuka from Hurent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was natural to save Yura because she was a Korean, but wasn’t Jishuka a representative of another country? Why did he save her?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yerim confirmed Jishuka’s large chest and pouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Really, that’s his taste?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"He’s a dog in rut.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee was furious.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was annoyed to see that woman hanging onto her brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m going.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the end, Sehee turned away from the electronic billboard and moved towards the library. Yerim wanted to see more of the broadcast, but was forced to follow Sehee.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then she thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I’m not even 20 years old yet, so should I try for a D cup?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She was seriously considering it.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent gazed at Jishuka and Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He took a health potion and an antidote before speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This isn’t a common antidote... The poison arrows are quite awful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He checked the scoreboard.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Korea has 131 points, the US has 82 points, Brazil has 73 points, the United Kingdom has 60 points and Spain has 0.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now there were only five countries left. Spain was ruled out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Spanish team’s Med was on the verge of being logged out by Regas.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent understood the battlefield and sent a whisper to Lauel in the rear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Get out of battle and focus on handling the targets.</span></i> <i><span style="">We have given up on the gold medal, but we need to take the silver medal.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">--</span><i><span style="">Isn’t the damage pretty big?</span></i> <i><span style="">Can you afford to go against Pagma's Descendant in that state?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The seven golden blades were still moving by themselves and destroying the targets.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent confirmed the scene and smiled darkly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Why not?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttadak.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent looked at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Since the situation is like this, shall I enjoy it a little?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an obvious provocation!&nbsp;</span><span style="">The confident Grid wasn’t going to fall for that provocation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Stop fooling around.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 1st ranked Kraugel. The 2nd ranked Zibal. The 3rd ranked Chris. The 7th ranked Agnus. The 8th ranked Hurent. The 11th ranked Bondre. Finally, the 14th ranked Hao.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura had called them the seven people stronger than her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid distinctly remembered it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he wasn’t nervous at all, despite Hurent being one of them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was someone who raided the strongest boss monsters alone!&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was confident that he could beat high rankers with his stats, skills and items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Jishuka, leave him to me and concentrate on the targets. Don’t you want the silver medal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes...! Thank you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka thanked Grid and disappeared into the forest with Samuel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Once Grid was alone with Hurent, he immediately unfolded his sword dance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment Grid moved two steps.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A 5m long red blade emerged from Hurent’s fingertip and pierced Grid’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 4,600 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Eh?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent attacked with timing that couldn’t be coped with, because Grid was busy with his sword dance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The damage was considerable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I suffered that much damage despite my legendary armor set?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Or was it the default damage of aura?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was confused but his best skill was already being used.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The giant blue greatsword filled with hatred roared as it headed for Hurent.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwarururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The trees in the area vibrated due to the overwhelming waves of energy coming from it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had planned to blow Hurent away.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent moved sideways at the correct timing and avoided Kill. Then he moved back to Grid and aimed his aura blades at the gap exposed by the greatsword swing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 4,600 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 4,600 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s constant damage. Aura, does it ignore defense and deal a fixed damage?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid frowned as he belatedly understood. The energy of Kill pierced empty air and faded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent clicked his tongue.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"In order to hit with a non-targeted skill, you first have to restrain your opponent’s movements. If that isn’t possible, you should predict their movements. Isn’t that part of the basics?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid took a potion to restore his health and asked,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Are you attempting to teach me right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Teach? Hahat! Nonsense. Is there any reason to do that type of favor for you? I’m simply disappointed. You have the strongest class and this is the extent of your skills~? Don’t you have any combat experience?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid snapped at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Of course I have combat experience...! You can’t imagine how many bosses I’ve raided alone so far!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is your combat experience limited to boss raids? Kukuk, of course, bosses are strong. But don’t they just fight with strength or with a fixed pattern? They don’t fight cleverly. Yes, just like you. Can’t you see that the difference in our combat experience is too big?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Talking nonsense just because you avoided my skill once.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The heated Grid moved his sword like butterflies dancing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This time, he was going to hit Hurent’s cheeky face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Pagma’s Swordsmanship had a weakness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">In order to activate the skill, the name must be said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">This took a minimum of 0.8 to 2 seconds before the skill was activated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Obviously, some people would feel that this was a short amount of time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In fact, none of the players, monsters and bosses Grid met had touched him during this time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But didn’t Yura counter in 0.5 seconds when facing a Crusher?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Furthermore, Hurent was much better than her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Teook!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment that Grid took the first step of his sword dance.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 4,600 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 4,600 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent hit Grid twice during that time. At the same time, he escaped to the rear, opening up a distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid checked the distance and decided it was impossible, cancelling his activation of Link.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It stinks.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He admitted that Hurent was strong.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was accepted compared to the bosses he had faced so far.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The aura’s fixed damage and ability to freely transform its shape was quite annoying, but the vulnerable part was that he couldn’t use a skill. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">Certainly, Grid had experience fighting.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he perceived it after two skills became useless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Are you going to use a skill haphazardly again? Do you have no learning ability?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent sighed as if Grid was pathetic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, Grid rushed to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay! I can just swing my sword instead of using skills. Then will you be able to avoid it? Eh? Blacksmith's Rage!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The +9 Failure clashed with the aura blades.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Strong.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent confirmed that his aura shook like a fire in front of wind and clicked his tongue. He tried to open a distance with Grid, but his basic movement speed wasn’t enough.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid persistently stuck to Hurent and swung his sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent barely managed to defend and confirmed that the cooldown of his Escape skill was over.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Escape.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">This close-range distance skill was something that all warrior classes possessed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent managed to get 5m away from Grid and shifted some of his aura to his lower half.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Attack power is reduced by 30%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Movement speed has increased by 30%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Faster?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was no longer able to narrow down the distance to Hurent, who was running away like a coward. In the end, he swapped out to the Ideal Dagger, used Quick Movements and shouted at Hurent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let’s finish this game.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent leaped towards where there were a lot of targets and released his aura all around him. There was an explosion and the US team’s score quickly updated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The United States has 109 points! Really amazing! After logging out the representatives from France, China and Japan, Hurent destroyed 16 targets in a single strike while running from Pagma’s Descendant! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What are you trying to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid wanted to help Jishuka and Regas. He wanted their countries to win the silver and bronze medals.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, he chased after Hurent to stop him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to his high persistence, Grid’s stamina remained steady while Hurent gradually became exhausted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I thought he invested most of his stats into strength, then some into agility and stamina. But now I see that his stats are high overall. Indeed, a blacksmith can increase their stats dramatically through the production of items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Over time, Hurent could grasp more about Grid. But his breathing was becoming labored and he was slowing down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I almost caught up!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s eyes sparkled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the end.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would soon catch that annoying guy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was filled with pleasure, but there was a problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 South Korean team-! 150 points! Victoryyy! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid noticed his mistake.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He forgot about the presence of Yura and the pavranium.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t tell Yura that he wanted to beat the US team, and he didn’t recall the target destruction order that he gave to the pavranium.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura and the pavranium kept destroying the targets while he pursued Hurent, eventually leading to this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Bye-bye~?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent laughed, as he had predicted this situation from the beginning.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was forced to log out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a rule that the team who achieved the quota could no longer remain on the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After that.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The United States were the next to reach 150 points after South Korea and achieved the silver medal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Britain and Brazil was left behind to compete for third place, and Britain eventually became the winner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka’s ability to destroy targets was much better than Natasha, but her partner was the problem. Samuel was too lacking and couldn’t protect Jishuka from Regas.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, hundreds of thousands of spectators watched as the Korean, United States, and United Kingdom team got on the podium.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It was enjoyable, newbie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dammit...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A funny scene was produced.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid won the gold medal and was scowling from the top of the podium, while Hurent received the silver medal next to him and was laughing loudly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Looking at the atmosphere of the two men, it was like the US had won.</span></p>
