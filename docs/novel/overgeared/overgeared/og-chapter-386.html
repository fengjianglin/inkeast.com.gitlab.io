 <p><span style="">Chapter 386</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I lost.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid realized he was defeated, but he didn’t get frustrated. He was burning with motivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This isn’t the only chance. I must go beyond you (me).’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The clone had 100% of his stats, skills, and items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The clone was now kindly telling him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘You can be as capable of me. So exert yourself.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid strengthened his grip on his greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The duration of his immortality was 5 seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the meantime, Grid was trying to combine Linked Kill Wave or Pinnacle Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t worry about winning, losing, or dying right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Link.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Cheook!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid started a light and cheerful dance like a butterfly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His black eyes shone more sharply than usual, resembling that of a bird of prey.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s appearance was gradually developing along with his solid heart and mature brain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His appearance and expression that were full of passion didn’t look bad.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid lightly circled around and narrowed the distance to the clone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At this time, Grid’s Greatsword moved horizontally in the movements of Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the precursor for Linked Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid tried to link Wave to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The cooldown time of Linked Kill hasn’t returned.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The casting of Linked Kill is cancelled.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Of course it was like this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Combining Linked Kill and Wave was an incomprehensible realm for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why is my clone capable of it?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was confused, but didn’t stop his actions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He used Pinnacle and Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wanted to try to acquire Pinnacle Kill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">But once again, the combination of Pinnacle Kill didn’t work. Pinnacle was activated before Kill was completed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The power might be less than that of Kill, but Pinnacle fell and deeply cut the heart of the clone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, it wasn’t enough damage to threaten the clone whose health had recovered thanks to Doran’s Ring and the Holy Light Armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was wishing for one thing in this situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Come on, counterattack.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Honestly, he wanted to avoid losing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The first problem was that he could lose his experience and items, and the second problem was his pride.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid didn’t give up despite sensing defeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment the clone’s counterattack reached him, he wore Doran’s Ring in order to recover his health and hope for a reversal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the clone was Grid. No, he knew Grid better than Grid did himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The clone acted with the knowledge that it would be pointless and dangerous to attack the invincible Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Suuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">‘You bastard!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rather than fighting back, the clone ran away, causing Grid to frown.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He ran all over the battlefield, causing irritation to rise.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Right before the immortal duration ended...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Snap!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[15,000 health has been restored.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid took the super health recovery potion taken from Reidan’s alchemy facility.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Chaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The clone calmly devoted himself to defense. He fully understood and blocked Grid’s sword with Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he started counterattacking as soon as Grid’s immortal state was over.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Of course, he didn’t forget to use a powerful one shot technique that would keep Grid from relying on Doran’s Ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Blackening, Blacksmith’s Rage, and Quick Movements.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Since Grid used it one step ahead of the other, the effects ran out for Grid first. Therefore, he couldn’t avoid the clone’s Kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Doran’s Ring has been equipped.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered fatal damage!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have died because health has dropped to 0.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have lost 30.6% experience.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Mission failed!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Exiting the 41st island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Moving to the last save point, the 40th island.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A black screen that hadn’t been seen for a long time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s vision turned black.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Are you okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 41st island.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moment that Grid came here after dying, he saw Sticks’ distressed face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was worried that Grid would suffer a mental blow, since this was his first defeat since entering the Behen Archipelago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid was fine.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid smiled at the worried Sticks and though positively.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I’m glad I didn’t lose any items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Of course, it was painful to lose a lot of experience.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His current experience gauge was 2%.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he challenged the 41st island and failed again, he couldn’t avoid losing a level.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid didn’t shrink back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is an opportunity.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He might fail a few more times, but if he overcame this trial, he would surely grow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was confident and grateful for this situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have to overcome this trial.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Effort was needed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I need to wait until the cooldown of Randy and the immortality passive returns.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The next 24 hours.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the meantime, Grid concentrated on studying Linked Kill Wave and Pinnacle Kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The order of the skills isn’t wrong.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The wrong element was somewhere else.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Finding it was the key.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sigh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid took deep breaths and sat down to meditate.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He tried to follow Regas’ usual practices.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Think about it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The clone’s Linked Kill Wave and Pinnacle Kill were different from when he used it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid recalled the previous battle and concentrated on analyzing it. He tried to get a clear picture of each and every one of the clone’s actions.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">"Meditation is the act of transcending from the pain of the mind and returning to a pure state of mind, without any distortions. It is the best way to look at yourself, or to look at specific situations and find a solution.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The desert city of Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro returned to the city after working all day in the fields, and was giving a lecture to Lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Meditation can also be used as a means to increase strength and stamina, and to reduce the cooldown of your skills. But humans are always self-centered. Meditation is a very challenging method of training that even the most famous knights find difficult. So young Lord, you don’t need to practice it right away. It is sufficient to know the concept... Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro made a sound of surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lord Steim.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The genius that Grid and Irene gave birth to quietly closed his eyes and started to maintain a constant breathing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A perfect state of selflessness!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lord’s mana flowed around him as he breathed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It proved that Lord was affecting nature, so it was natural for Piaro to be astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I was only able to acquire Natural State after becoming a legend.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Of course, Lord wasn’t perfect yet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But just awakening the basic concepts was a tremendous achievement.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because some of the world’s most powerful and tenacious minds couldn’t enter this natural state.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was Lord going to grow up into?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Maybe he would be the only one who could transcend Muller, one of the greatest legends in history.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He will grow more and more in the future.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It would surely give Piaro a new enlightenment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro’s heart burned hot.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">[The skill ‘Meditation’ has been acquired!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Meditation]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Increases health and mana regeneration rate by 50%, and stamina regeneration by 30%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill cooldown time will be reduced by 10%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Resource Consumption: None.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Activation Condition: Focus.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* This isn’t a skill that can be artificially invoked. It will activate automatically when your concentration is extremely high.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In Satisfy, there were several skills that could be learned naturally when certain conditions were met. One of them was Meditation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Despite the fact that Grid gained a way to increase his stamina recovery rate and reduce skill cooldown time, he didn’t make a fuss. He kept calm.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was too busy focusing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Think about it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid quickly erased any thoughts about the Meditation skill and recalled the movements of the clone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was there any difference in the actions that the clone took with Link?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No. He was certain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If so, was there something different about the actions of Kill?&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was also nothing. He was certain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What about the behavior of the clone when using Wave or Pinnacle?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then why was it only possible for the clone to use Linked Kill Wave and Pinnacle Kill?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had been thinking for over five hours when he finally got a flash.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The timing is different.'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The action that connected Link and Kill, in the case of Linked Kill, it seemed to have been done immediately. However, Linked Kill Wave seemed to have a slight gap.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he didn’t know the exact interval.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will try it once.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t delay once he had this thought.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He got up and used Grid’s Greatsword to try and connect Link and Kill with a little time difference.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then Link was triggered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The interval is too long.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was no need to worry about it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would shorten the interval in the next attempt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid took a deep breath and made a second attempt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The result?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was also a failure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In order to used Linked Kill Wave, the timing of Link and Kill had to be sophisticated and perfect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I will challenge until it succeeds.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Failure wasn’t shameful.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a stepping stone to success.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid knew this fact better than anybody because he had repeatedly lived a life of failure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After that.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid failed to use Linked Wave Kill several times, but he didn’t give up to the end.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A smile appeared on the face of the watching Sticks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Truly Pagma’s Descendant.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sticks knew that Pagma’s Rare Book was one of the treasures that couldn’t be found.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yet Grid managed to find it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sticks guessed that Grid’s tenacity was great, but it was actually even more than he expected.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In Sticks’ eyes, Grid was the type of person who would have a much brighter future.</span></p>
