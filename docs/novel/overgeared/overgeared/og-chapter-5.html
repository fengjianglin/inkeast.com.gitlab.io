 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a completely unwelcome quest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was it because I didn’t like the rewards? That was impossible!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This reward is really good...’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">3,000 gold was worth around 3,600,000 won when converted into real cash, which was close to 40 days of revenue for me if I worked without any rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the great thing was the title of ‘Earl’s Son-in-Law’.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">All stats +20!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">I currently had nine stats in total: strength, stamina, agility, intelligence, dexterity, composure, indomitable, dignity and insight. If I added the nobility stat, that would equal 10 in total.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If all of these stats were given 20 points, it would be a total of 200 stat points.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Every time I gained a level, 10 stat points were obtained, so 200 stat points were worth 20 levels. It would also be wonderful to have a beautiful aristocratic lady as my bride.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'The road is open. But...’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a reason why the rewards were so good.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an S grade quest!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Earl Ashur’s Fury was an S grade quest.&nbsp;’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the time of the quest, I was level 79 but couldn’t cope with the difficulty. I was killed many times during the quest and dropped down to level 73.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In addition, the time spent was three months!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was currently level -1, so I had no means of clearly an S grade quest with a time limit. Why would I accept a quest that would obviously fail?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Furthermore, my level will fall by two if I fail.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My body trembled with fear and anger at the thought of my level dropping to -3.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'But why on earth is it an S grade quest again?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">S grade quests were never common quests. Even the top level rankers who were above level 200 could only count the number of times that they’ve received an S grade quest on their left hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, I wasn’t high level user and was currently at level -1.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I recalled what Doran said:&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘As you know, the Yatan Temple is filled with evil energy. Ordinary people will become afraid if they stay here for a while. But I observed you, and you are fine despite all the time that passed. In addition, you can even manage to laugh alone. You, don’t you actually have great abilities?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were hints in these words.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The quest seemed to be generated by staying in the Yatan Temple for a certain period of time without falling into the ‘fear’ state.&nbsp;</span><span style="">My title and composure stat lowered my chances of falling under an abnormal condition.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was it good? Did I like it?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Won’t I be screwed if this is a forced quest? The attributes of this title are crazy, but it’s like this game is trying to make me quit.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I replied unhesitatingly,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I can’t do it. Ask someone else.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The quest was refused.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I refused the quest, but Doran didn’t quit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You are the only unusual person, so please help me. A precious person’s life is involved!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Doran is desperate. Do you understand his sad circumstances and accept the quest?]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The concept of the notification window was lost. Did it think I was in a position to take care of others right now?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">I immediately swiped the window away and said,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“You are mistaken. I am weak and incompetent, so I won’t be able to help you. It would be better for you to take care of it alone.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The quest was refused.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“As you know, the believers of Yatan use powerful black magic! I can’t rescue the young lady from them alone! Please don’t turn away, lend me your strength!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Doran hasn’t given up. Would you like to accept the quest?)&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No, first of all, I don’t have the ability to do it...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The quest was refused.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You are too modest! Don’t you know that the power to ignore their fear isn’t common?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Doran can only depend on you. Would you like to accept the quest?]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sometimes, there were quest NPCs who would persist like this. They had their own desperate situations.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yes, I could understand Doran’s feelings. If Doran returned without rescuing his master’s daughter, his head would go flying off.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But what about me? What if I failed and my level dropped again?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why should I go through such terrible things because of him? I was more important than a complete stranger! The biggest problem was that I didn’t have the ability to help him in the first place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Please help! I am begging you!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doran fell to his knees.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I looked at him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">This man, all the words I spoke to him were entering one ear and leaving the other. Or maybe he thought I was lying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'It’s probably the latter. Is it so great that I don’t feel fear while staying in the Yatan Temple? I haven’t been here before so I don’t even know what I’m supposed to feel.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I faced Doran head on and explained with a more serious attitude,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I'm really sorry, but I truly don’t have the strength to help you. Don’t waste your time on me; call the earl and ask for his help.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The quest was refused.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Every hour is urgent! The young lady’s life might be in danger while I go to ask the earl for help! You are the only person I can rely on! This is a request!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Doran is hoping for a helping hand. Would you like to accept the quest?]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The limits of patience.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah, this is frustrating! Do you really need my help? I don’t want to look at you anymore, so go away!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Please give mercy for the sake of her life!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What? No! Damn. Yes, I should leave. I am going now!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I once again refused the quest and turned away from Doran.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was a terrible quest that would cause my level to drop by two upon failure, so I wanted to avoid it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But unlike my thoughts, my feet didn’t move quickly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was 200% over the weight limit, so my movement speed was reduced by 100%.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doran saw that I was moving as slow as a turtle and misunderstood my actions as he teared up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You act so intimidatingly, but you are actually conflicted... You really do want to help me...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“......”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Stop feeling conflicted and help me!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Doran feels hope again. Would you like to accept the quest?]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Bullshit! I won’t help!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The quest was refused.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I ignored him and hastened my steps. But once again, my speed was slow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This only deepened Doran’s misunderstanding.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Maybe you’re conflicted because your life is busy, but the life of a person is more important! This is a request!!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I can’t! It isn't possible!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t deceive yourself! In fact, you are suffering as well! You can’t leave this place immediately, which is why there is such hesitation in your step!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There is no hesitation! I’m not walking slowly! My baggage is heavy, that’s all!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doran continued chasing after me, and my slow pace couldn’t get rid of him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Would you like to accept the quest?]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Would you like to accept the quest?]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Would you like...]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What a stupid jerk!’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The notification windows kept popping up no matter how much I refused. I had to make a drastic decision.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I can’t carry on like this. Yes, I have to refuse, even if I develop a hostile relationship with him. He isn’t a NPC I need to build up a relationship with, so it won’t hurt if he is my enemy.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I pulled out Mamon’s greatsword and glared at Doran.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I definitely can’t help you. If you don’t get away right now, I am prepared to hurt you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doran grasped the atmosphere and took one step back. Then he slowly opened his mouth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I really wish you would help me...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Doran is asking for the last time. Would you like to accept the quest?]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Swipe!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">How many times do I have to see this damn notification window?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I won’t help! Even if I can help, I don’t want to! I won’t help!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My stress went over the threshold and I could no longer suppress my anger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, I yelled and swung Mamon’s greatsword, expressing my intent not to talk to Doran anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kaaack!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The sensation of hitting something was transmitted through my fingertips as a scream was heard at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I turned my gaze to the side of the greatsword and saw what just occurred: a believer wearing the robe of Yatan had collapsed with Mamon’s greatsword in his neck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">An ominous chill went down my spine.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I was aiming at the crazy guy, so why did the person next to him...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As I stared at the dying believer, a new notification window popped up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your relationship with the Yatan Church has become hostile.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You won’t be able to receive Yatan’s blessings.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The followers of Yatan will try to kill you when they find you.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The atmosphere of the temple changed. While I was surrounded by dozens of Yatan believers, Doran got up and placed a hand on my shoulder and cried out,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Thank you!!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Rescue the Earl’s Esteemed Daughter]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Difficulty: S&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Irene, the only daughter of Earl Steim, is a beautiful and innocent virgin. The elders of Yatan had kidnapped Irene in order to sacrifice her for her virgin blood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You can’t tolerate the evil deeds of Yatan’s followers. You must surely rescue Irene.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Conditions: Rescue Irene within one hour after accepting the quest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Clear Reward: 3,000 gold, a low probability of becoming the earl’s son-in-law.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Earl’s son-in-law: Nobility stat will open, all stats +20.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You will be treated as a viscount after marrying the earl’s esteemed daughter. Power and honor will rise. You can advance into the social circle of the nobles. You will receive a monthly salary. This can be a shortcut to becoming a high-ranking official or lord.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Failure: Level -2.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The quest has been accepted.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Due to my hostile relationship with the Yatan Church, the ‘Rescue the Earl’s Esteemed Daughter’ quest was forced upon me.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huhuhu...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Some might say this was unlucky. No, it was more accurate to say that I had no luck.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Failure once again... it will be level -3!’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At any rate, I had no luck. Perhaps I sold a country in my previous life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Who dares hurt Yatan’s believers! Aren’t you afraid of the curse of God Yatan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“God Yatan is almighty! God Yatan has already noticed your sin! You won’t be safe for the rest of your life!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You will pay a heavy price for your blasphemy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The angry voices of the Yatan followers clamored around me. Their crazy eyes were filled with absolute hostility.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Will I die now?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The followers of Yatan were black magicians. Black magicians had strong curse abilities, so they were difficult to deal with.</span></p>
