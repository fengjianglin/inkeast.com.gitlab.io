 <p><span style="">Chapter 89</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style=""> “... This!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Malacus, who was about to crush Regas’ head, became frightened and stopped moving.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'It isn’t a coincidence?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Before the Tzedakah Guild had arrived here.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Malacus faced Grid 1-on-1 and failed to kill him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid wasn’t strong. Rather, he was weak. If Malacus wanted, he could kill Grid in a matter of seconds. In other words, he was at the level of a bug.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid was somewhat strange. He was obviously weak, but an unknown source radiated from him. The overwhelmed Malacus was forced to step back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I don’t understand it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had dismissed it but after experiencing it again, it wasn’t a coincidence.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The pressure felt from Grid was real.&nbsp;</span><span style="">How could a newbie exert such a powerful presence?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I should only fear God Yatan!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Malacus was disturbed and let go of Regas. Meanwhile, Grid was approaching.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Shit!'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Malacus retreated to the maximum distance, while Grid helped Regas.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Regas, are you okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas gazed at Grid with eyes that were twinkling like lanterns.&nbsp;</span><span style="">With a single sword dance, he overwhelmed Malacus who had captured the second-ranked person in the Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid alone dominated 17 of the top 100 users, so his presence was bigger than any top ranker that Regas had met.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He isn’t even a famous ranker yet he has this dignity...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas recalled the first time he met Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t wear armor and only hunted monsters with a sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Everyone else called him a braggart and laughed, but Regas believed it. He through Grid was a reliable person.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The more I look at Grid, the greater he is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas was a ranker in the top 30 of the unified rankings. Yet he was feeling envy towards Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid felt an enormous joy at the words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Until recently, I was an ordinary user and now a ranker is admiring me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">For the original Grid, rankers were a vast presence that could only be seen on TV or in the distance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But since becoming Pagma’s Descendant, Grid’s life had undergone a great change.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘My mouth is tingling!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid wanted to wrap himself in Regas’ words. But unfortunately, Restraint only lasted for three seconds. There was no room to relax.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Unfortunately, the situation is like this...’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s brain was busy calculating the profit and losses as he ran away with Regas.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘After using the sword dance once, I can definitely feel the benefits. It is definite. Considering Regas’ nature, he will want to pay this debt back in the future.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Three seconds was a short amount of time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After the duration of Restraint finished, Malacus regained his freedom. Then he appeared in front of Grid in an instant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t a dash type skill, but the manifestation of high-level magic that allowed him to leap through space itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was stunned to see Malacus appear in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“G-Ghost?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Malacus gritted his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The feeling of pressure from you has now disappeared as if it were a lie. Was I mistaken? It can’t be! You have tricked me! Disgraceful person. Show your skills. Or you will never leave here alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was like a creepy and bizarre mixture of two voices.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hiik!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s face turned blue. He bowed his head to try and beg for his life.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that time, a sphere of fire flashed and hit Malacus.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Use this gap to escape!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">While Malacus was caught in the explosion, Grid turned his head and found a familiar woman.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he couldn’t help asking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Laella?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Laella, An 18-year -old British girl, was a global singer and also a top ranker in Satisfy!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why was she here?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“D-Don’t tell me?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid, who was her avid fan, asked Regas.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Regas, does Laella belong to your guild?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s eyes were bloodshot and his nostrils flared.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Regas snorted and nodded towards Laella.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Yes, that's right. She is a colleague who has been with us from L.T.S. to Satisfy. Grid, do you like her songs?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow, amazing! I really like Laella’s breasts... Ah, no, Laella sings great! Haha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was captivated by a certain part of Laella and forgot his life was at risk.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka hurriedly shouted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"How long are you going to stand there? Come this way!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka fired dozens of arrows into the sky as she spoke.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The rain of arrows poured over Malacus’ head, who couldn’t see due to the smoke caused by the explosion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Due to losing his composure from Grid’s actions and having his vision blocked, Malacus became a hedgehog without a shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid and Regas sprinted in Jishuka’s direction.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But once again, he was caught by Malacus.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Do you think I will let you escape?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuoooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Malacus pulled out the arrows stuck in his back, waved his arms and three black spears shot through the air. They flew towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ah, why is this bastard coming after me? Shit! Am I that intimidating?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment that Grid was going to pull out Dainsleif from his inventory.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A shadowy figured appeared and protected Grid and Regas.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The spears that should’ve pierced Grid hit the ground and exploded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Malacus’ face distorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"There is a rat mixed among the hybrid dogs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A dark blade appeared in front of Malacus. Then the blade was fired, aiming precisely at the shadowy figure who protected Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The shadowy figure couldn’t run away!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rather than blood pouring out, it quietly disappeared into the fog.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A clone? Che, I really don’t like this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Malacus was furious and started casting spells to chase Grid again. However, a young man with apathetic eyes appeared and interfered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He moved left and right, created dozens of clones.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Syu syu syu syu syuk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Daggers and other weapons flew in different orbits.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was impossible to develop a shield for every attacked area.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In this case, what measures could Malacus take to protect the body?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The answer was simple.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It won’t get through!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Malacus’ black shield expanded to surround his whole body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">An absolute defense!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The watching Vantner thought it was ridiculous.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"How is this balanced? Isn’t this shielding ability a scam? It can be activated without casting, and could even protect the whole body? It is invincible! How do we beat that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon didn’t agree.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“If that defensive ability is as invincible as you think, he would keep the shield constantly deployed. But he didn’t do that. Therefore, Jishuka managed to attack him several times. He only deploys the shield for the minimum time and area to block the attack, then he repeats this again and again. The magic power consumed to deploy and maintain the shield is considerable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I agree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Malacus used chains of darkness to bind the feet of the clones, then summoned hellfire to burn them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The shadowy figure who rescued Grid and Regas gave their opinion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“If Malacus is burdened by the magic power required to use the shield as Pon thinks... Now it is our turn to be attacked. He will no longer want all his magic power to be consumed by the shield, so he will use it all to attack.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the right answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Noble master of hell! Let go of the reins of the dogs you have tamed since eons ago! Command them to eat the hearts of those who have oppressed your lowly servant!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The blue sky turned dark. There was no moon or stars, just darkness. Then the thick darkness covered the forest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The dark magic dominated the area and made the bodies of the Tzedakah Guild members go cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon muttered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Are we going to die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka hurriedly exclaimed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Protect Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She had witnessed Grid’s sword dance a moment ago, so she was no longer certain that Grid was a blacksmith. Grid’s class was sure to be a blade dancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Still, Jishuka couldn’t give up hope. Grid had clearly known the Special Jaffa Arrow with one glance. Therefore, she decided to prioritize Grid’s protection.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban moved in front of Grid. Then he used the best defense skill available to him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That wasn’t all. Vantner, Pon, Faker, Laella and all the members of the Tzedakah Guild prepared to guard Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The ground where Malacus stood moved like lava and dozens of dark shadows started to rise.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The dozens of shadows became dark dogs with three heads.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Grrrung.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Bark bark!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The 2m large dogs that could spew out fire, ice and poison from each head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their red eyes made them seem like rabid dogs. They barked like truly mad dogs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Malacus looked at them like they were adorable, and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The hell’s keepers have come here!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Keeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The hell’s keepers ran wildly towards the Tzedakah Guild and Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Where are these dogs going?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner’s twin axes might be useless against Malacus, but they could easily hit the dogs.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Vantner confidently ran towards the hell’s keepers and then spun his axes in every direction like a storm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oraaaaa!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeok!</span></i> <i><span style="">Peok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Bark bark!</span></i> <i><span style="">Bark!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">At first glance, Vantner seemed to have the advantage; however, the battle situation changed in just a few seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The hell’s keepers didn’t die, despite being cut in half with an axe.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Vantner was burned all over, and his legs were frozen, making him unable to move. Furthermore, his skin was turning green and he coughed up black blood, showing signs of poisoning.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even his two axes were rusted and could no longer function as weapons.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was caused by the flames, ice, and poison spewed by the hell’s keepers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the same with his colleagues.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon used Mach Spear to help with Vantner’s retreat.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The sonic spear pierced through the hell’s keepers surrounding Vantner.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Yip!</span></i> <i><span style="">Yelp!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The hell’s keepers panicked and scattered all over the place.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Using that gap to recover, Vantner used his invincible skill to escape from the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban’s face hardened as he watched the series of events.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Not one died...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A normal monster would die in one hit when attacked by the spear. If there was a critical blow, even a boss monster would receive enormous damage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yet the hell’s keepers survived Mach Spear. This meant that the hell’s keepers possessed defense and health beyond ordinary monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka and the guild members realized the seriousness of the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Vantner distributed all his points to strength, but he is still a guardian knight. It can’t be denied that Vantner’s defense and magic resistance is the highest in our guild. Yet Vantner was turned into a rag in an instant. How many times has this happened? That dog’s attack power is top level among the monsters we have met so far.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon agreed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I estimate that these dogs are at least level 300. We can probably deal with two or three of them alone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were 29 monsters that were at least level 300 and armed with three attributes. There was Malacus as well.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The odds were becoming smaller.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The atmosphere quickly sank. The hell’s keepers fell upon the guild members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka commanded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Respond with ranged attacks!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They would be severely hurt if they went head to head with the hell’s keepers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka’s command was appropriate, but there were few ranged classes among the guild members.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Bark bark!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Not surprisingly, the hell’s keepers broke through the Tzedakah Guild members, defeated Toban’s shield and aimed their poison breaths.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid, who felt like his life was in danger after seeing Toban’s shield become corroded in an instant, took out a golden shield from his inventory.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that moment, an amazing thing happened.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kiing!</span></i> <i><span style="">Whine!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The hell’s keepers, who didn’t retreat even when hit by Jishuka’s arrows, retreated as soon as they saw Grid’s shield.</span></p>
