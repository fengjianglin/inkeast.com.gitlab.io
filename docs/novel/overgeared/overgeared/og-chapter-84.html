 <p><span style="">Chapter 84</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">A fortnight passed since the war between the Alliance and the Yatan Church began.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the process, the Giant Guild had gained many achievements, so they were celebrating today.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Congratulations on the master’s inauguration as a lord! Cheers!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cheers!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Giant Guild was one of the best guilds since Satisfy launched. Their guild master, Chris, was a top ranked player who was third on the unified rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris, who was appointed as Lord of Pedro for his achievements on the battlefield, proclaimed towards his 530 guild members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Now is the time for stabilization! For the next fortnight, we will stop going to battle! We will focus on Pedro’s defense and strengthening our power! And!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris stopped talking and pulled out a leather armor. He once again checked the information of the armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Unexpectedly Comfortable Rat Leather Armor]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 24/24 &nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 22 &nbsp;Movement Speed: +3%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An armor made of rat leather by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but lacks experience and reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It is designed and created so that the wearer won’t be inconvenienced when moving. The wearer can move a little faster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The fact that this type of armor was made with meager materials is amazing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 13 or higher. Beginner Leather Armor Mastery.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The unknown craftsman who created the first epic rated arrows and caused a hot topic for a while!&nbsp;</span><span style="">How to find him? He desperately searched for a while, but couldn’t even gain the slightest clue.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, not long ago, he accidentally found a clue while reading a post on a community site.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Please make it in time...!’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris once again eagerly prayed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Have half of the guild form a search team! Go to Winston! The goal is the unknown craftsman! Find him and invite him to the guild! No matter what conditions he presents, accept it unconditionally!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In order for the guild to become stronger quickly, they needed a number of high level combat classes. But in order for the guild to become more robust and complete, it needed skillful support classes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris failed to invite Panmir and Steng, who were first and second ranked on the blacksmith rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He succeeded in inviting the fourth and fifth ranked blacksmiths, but it was still lacking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Therefore, he wanted to invite the unknown craftsman. Chris wanted to establish the supremacy of the Giant Guild with him.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“We are lacking in people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Tzedakah Guild were too busy to worry about their mental conditions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They searched for Euphemina and completed quests against the Yatan Church to increase the reputation of the guild.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were also still looking for the unknown craftsman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">First of all, the Tzedakah Guild only had 17 members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The guild members might all be rankers, but they were lacking the numbers to do various things at once.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the end, the guild members didn’t think it was possible to maintain this and presented their opinion to Jishuka. Thus, a meeting was held.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Let’s postpone Euphemina’s death. The reason we want to kill her is to get revenge for our members and the dignity of the guild, but there is no immediate benefit. On the other hand, the Yatan related quests and the unknown craftsman all directly benefit the guild. I think it is better to postpone the revenge and focus on the quests and finding the unknown craftsman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I agree. It isn’t easy to catch a girl who hides like a rat.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"7 votes for. 7 votes against. 3 people have abstained from voting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I think we should go ahead and proceed like we have been. If we quit along the way, rumors will increase. I’d rather take off the quests related to the Yatan Church. To be honest, we are skilled and can always improve our guild reputation without having to rely on these miscellaneous quests.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right. Getting revenge is a matter of our pride. It shouldn’t be delayed. Has everybody forgotten about the Tzedakah Guild’s pride?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"7 votes for. 5 votes against. 5 people have abstained from voting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas, who had been watching the meeting progress silently, finally spoke up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“What about looking for the unknown craftsman?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka asked Regas.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Do you think we should postpone it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas instantly replied.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"No, to be honest, don’t you think it should have the highest priority? What about you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I agree.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka concluded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"We will stop the Yatan related quests. Concentrate our power on finding Euphemina and the unknown craftsman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After the meeting, the guild members scattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Winston.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Tzedakah Guild was staying in this city. Due to many circumstances, it was likely that the unknown craftsman was staying here.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hrmm, the meeting was boring. Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After the meeting.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Regas discovered an Asian person while he was going to his inn. Then a bright smile crossed his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hey! Gladiator of the body!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid, who had been walking with his head down, looked up with frustration when his path was blocked and someone called out to him. He recognized Regas straight away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Regas?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Haha! You know me? I thought you wouldn’t remember.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Regas rejoiced.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid sat down at the fountain and replied.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"A good loan guarantor... No, you were the only one who defended me against the accusations, so how could I forget you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Several months ago, when he was at leve -3, Grid tried to participate in the Guardian of the Forest raid party.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But when he applied, he became the subject of criticism by the other raid party members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that time, the only one who believed and supported Grid was Regas.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid felt reluctance rather than appreciation towards Regas. The pure and good nature was the opposite of Grid, and he also disliked the fact that he was handsome.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But after a conversation, Regas seemed more naive than Grid thought and was someone who would act as a guarantor for a debt. So he finished the relationship with Regas as neatly as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now they met again!&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was time to eat the rice that had been laid at that time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas was worried.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Why is your expression so dark? Did something happen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid made the saddest possible expression and explained.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“An old man stole my item.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas jolted with surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Such a wicked...! There is such a bad person in this world!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hah...it seems like it. People who take the livelihood of others should die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid expressed his resentment. Regas nodded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"People like that should pay the price.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid started preparing to eat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Hah...how good would it be if someone helped me... Well... there is no chance. In this harsh world, there is no one who would help others for free. Right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas jumped up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"This world is harsh, what are you saying? This world is warm and beautiful!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is that right? Huh...but the world that I’ve experienced is harsh and poisonous. Having my item stolen...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is that item? It is that important?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes...really important... It was my life... But I lost it... I think I will commit suicide...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas’ face paled from fear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“S-Suicide! You can’t commit such a sin! Aren’t you sorry towards your parents? Filial duty! Have you forgotten the spirit of Taekwondo?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hah, I'm sorry. I’m so physically and mentally tired that I had a bad idea.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the end, Regas bit the bait.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“This can’t continue! I will help you! I can’t forgive anyone who would deal such a big injury to others!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Yes!&nbsp;</span><span style="">I got you!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment Grid was cheering with delight...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka incidentally heard the conversation between the two people and hit Regas on the back of the head. Then she pulled at Regas’ earlobe.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"You’re going to help someone? Haven’t you forgotten a lot of things?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s eyes were shining as he looked at her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Tanned skin! Red and plump lips. Long and curved eyes! A big chest!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka was the ideal girl that Grid had dreamed of.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“T-This?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Despite his earlobe still being pulled, Regas explained to the questioning Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“She’s my guild master. Ah! Ack! I-It hurts!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Does it hurt, you pathetic bastard?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Aaaagh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka pulled Regas’ earlobe more strongly and turned towards Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She sighed as she saw Grid look up and down her body with explicit eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was used to attention from men, but it was still unpleasant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even if this was virtual reality, not reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hey you."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh? Yes!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid came to attention as Jishuka called out to him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was generally strong in front of women, but it was different when the woman was his ideal type. He couldn’t help being nervous when standing in front of his dreams.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka glanced at him and sniffed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Newbie. Regas is busy right now, so you should take care of your own matters. Now then, we’re going.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka kept holding Regas’ earlobe and pulled him away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Newbie. Newbie. Newbie. Newbie...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid looked at Jishuka’s departing back while the word echoed in his mind.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"She looked at me like I was a dog.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An ideal type was just an ideal type.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid recovered his spirit and caught up with Jishuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hey.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka was surprised when Grid, who couldn’t even meet her eyes a short time ago, blocked her way. But it was only for a second.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka gave him a relaxed smile and crossed her arms, emphasizing her chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why are you calling me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Keok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s gaze focused on Jishuka’s chest. But he quickly cleared his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Can you give me Regas? He said he would help me. What right do you have to interfere?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I have a natural right. I’m his guild master. So he must follow my commands. Do you understand? Don’t be offended and go away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Just because you’re his guild master, doesn’t give you the right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Then? Does a third party have the right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka naturally had the advantage. Rather than fight with her, Grid chose to bow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Please. I am really desperate right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We are desperate as well. We can’t spare any people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I'm more desperate!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We are more desperate!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I am more desperate!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“We are!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Me!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Whisper.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A large number of people gathered as an adult man and woman began a childish argument.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, it caused a big wave because Jishuka was famous.</span></p>
