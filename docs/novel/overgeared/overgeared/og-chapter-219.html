 <p><span style="">Chapter 219</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Khan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Three hours before Piaro was misunderstood as a legendary farmer and feng shui expert.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid came to the smithy where Khan was working alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh! You came!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I missed you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I haven’t been able to eat, because I wanted to see you!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Eh? Should I have missed meals as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hahaha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid and Khan hugged as they reunited after a long time. It was a friendship that transcended identity and age, so they welcomed each other enthusiastically.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I was worried that you wouldn’t be able to adapt to the warm weather of the west, but you seem fine. Rather, you look healthier."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan was in the latter half of his 60’s. He had passed the average life expectancy of the people of the Eternal Kingdom, so it was safe to say that he was at the end of his life.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But after returning to being a blacksmith thanks to Grid, Khan worked all day and looked like he was in his 40’s or 50’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You don’t have to worry. I have been working with fire all my life, so how can I be threatened by this heat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You’re a great inspiration.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he knew that the lifespan of an NPC was finite so he couldn’t suppress the uneasiness in his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Please live for a long time.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The first friend in his life, Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid wouldn’t be able to bear the sadness that would come when he needed to say farewell to the person who opened up his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan noticed the sad emotions in Grid’s smile and became slightly teary.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He reminds me of my son.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His late son. If he hadn’t become sick and died early, he would’ve been Duke Grid’s age right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Originally, my son should be the one worrying about me...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He wanted to see his son. But he could appease that longing with Duke Grid beside him. Khan was thankful for Duke Grid filling his vacancy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan swallowed back his tears and bowed his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh? What?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t understand the intentions behind Khan’s sudden action. Khan smiled at his puzzled expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Didn’t you come here to help me? So I wanted to thank you! Hahaha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What...? This is originally my work.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid brought Khan to Reidan so that Khan wouldn’t be lonely, not for the manpower.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“But the situation of the city is a little inconvenient right now, so I am grateful for your help. Let’s work together to solve the problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid took off the Holy Light set and changed into old clothing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The dirty novice clothing was what Grid wore when he worked as a blacksmith. The efficiency increased because it was easy to move in the clothing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The only downside was that Grid looked like a complete beggar when he wore it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh! You can’t hide your dignity with these shabby clothes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s current dignity and charm stats were comparable to the king of a kingdom, so he was always brimming with elegance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid swept away his hair and revealed his great forehead. He tied a cloth around his head so that his hair wouldn’t flow down, and looked around the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is unbelievably large.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A general smithy only had one or two small or medium sized furnaces installed. Usually only three to five people could work at the same time in a smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, the Overgeared members looked at the future and invested in Reidan’s smithy, giving it a total of eight large furnaces. The sight of eight large furnaces lined up in a row was impressive.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Isn’t this at the level of a factory? Dozens of blacksmiths can work at the same time and produce a large quantity of items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But that was a story for later, when they had many blacksmiths.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Currently, there was only Grid and Khan, so the big size of the smithy couldn’t be taken advantage of.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I should look into inviting blacksmith users.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid looked at the smithy before deciding to start working.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he didn’t have the method to make a rake.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I don’t know how to make any farming equipment.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was because he never needed to make farming equipment before.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But that wasn’t a problem.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had the Legendary Blacksmith’s Appraisal skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid held one of the rakes made by Khan and used appraisal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Sturdy Rake]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Normal</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 20/20 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 3~7</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A farming equipment suitable for digging at the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It is made by Blacksmith Khan who can represent a region, so it is a rake with excellent durability.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 60</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A hidden function doesn’t exist.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have grasped the materials that make up Sturdy Rake, the production method, and the intentions of its creator.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your understanding of the Sturdy Rake is now at 100%. You will be able to use the Sturdy Rake perfectly.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have learned how to make a rake.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The rake production method was added.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was satisfied and started work.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">He bent the structure at the end to resemble a trident.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a simple structure, so Khan was able to produce one rake in just 20 minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yet Grid was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Just like when raiding boss monsters, Grid was extremely focused as he devoted himself to making one rake.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He carefully shaped the ends like he was making a sword, then he combined it with the handle part.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had over 2,000 dexterity, so his hands delicately handled the rake like he was touching Irene’s pale body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Two hours later.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah, I should take a rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Age didn’t lie.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The weary Khan stopped working. On the other hand, Grid had superhuman stamina and wasn’t exhausted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan looked closely at his work and was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No, what are you doing right now?” </span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh? What's the problem?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid looked like he didn’t understand, so Khan asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why are you spending two hours making a rake? I’ve already finished six rakes in two hours... Isn’t this a waste of time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hrmm.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid identified the six rakes made by Khan. Of course, they were all normal rated. The degree of completion wasn’t satisfactory, considering Khan’s skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Khan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid stared straight at Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan flinched at the sight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s eyes were as deep as the ocean, like a wise man.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was quite different from the usual Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Grid can also look like this...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then Grid asked the astounded Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Shouldn’t you always do your best when making equipment? So why are you roughly making the farming equipment?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That... Produce as much as possible. Lauel said to mass produce as much farming equipment as possible so that he could put more manpower into the rehabilitation project."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Mass production? Even lowly blacksmiths can do something like that."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid emanated a huge pressure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Right now, he wasn’t a greedy young man or Khan’s valued friend.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was no doubt that he was a legendary blacksmith, Pagma’s Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Your role isn’t to produce average farming equipment for ordinary farmers.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Then what is my role?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid replied firmly to Khan’s question.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“It’s to make the best farming equipment that will help ordinary farmers become the best. &nbsp;That is your mission as an advanced blacksmith. Please don’t forget your pride as an advanced blacksmith, no matter the situation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan had worked with Grid for a long time and accumulated experience. Thanks to the skill Blacksmith’s Affection, his blacksmithing skill reached advanced level 7.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was one of the best blacksmiths that currently existed, and he realized the truth of Grid’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You’re absolutely right!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan was highly motivated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid handed the rake that he’d just completed to Khan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Look at what I created.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Truly brilliant...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Ideal Rake]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 50/50 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 25~31</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Stamina +7.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Dexterity +12.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* It will slightly improve the quality of the soil.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A farming equipment suitable for digging at the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An item made by the blacksmith ‘G’ who has a reputation close to a legend.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Despite the use of bad quality iron and wood as the material, its function is outstanding.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The three delicate prongs will make the soil finer, improving soil quality.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 51</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The one rake that Grid made in two hours is much more valuable than the six rakes that I made!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He also wanted to make a good rake.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan pledged before standing in front of the furnace again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t overdo it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was concerned about Khan’s health, but the highly concentrated Khan could no longer hear his voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Yes, this is like him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid smiled warmly before starting to make his second rake.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Two hours later.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid and Khan both completed a rare rated rake.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But once again, two hours later...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes! It can’t be compared to your work, but I have also produced a satisfactory rake!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan succeeded in making an epic rated rake.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The performance was less than Grid’s, but it was clearly an excellent rake.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Indeed, this was the dignity of an Advanced Blacksmith level 7.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then what about Grid?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Damn...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a normal rating.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was embarrassed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t know that a normal rating would emerge when he was making such a simple item.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Are you trying to deceive me with a rake?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s pride as a legendary blacksmith was once again wounded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Once again, two hours later.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid and Khan both completed a rare rated rake.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Not bad."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan was happy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid was boiling with anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh, dammit...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A legendary blacksmith was having such a hard time making farming equipment?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">This wasn’t normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Are you tricking me again? These damn scum!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid yelled at the operators who were watching from somewhere. Then Khan sent him a pitiful look.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It has been a long time since I’ve seen this...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a frequent phenomenon when they worked together.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan left Grid shouting alone and started making a new rake.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now it was time for dinner.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel finished today’s work and ran to the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let’s go eat. Then we need to consult with the guild about the estate management plans... Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel’s expressions twisted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wondered how much Grid and Khan would’ve made in half a day, but there was less than 20 tools.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Surely you weren’t playing around?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel expected a legendary blacksmith to work like a machine.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was feeling disappointed when Grid threw him a rake.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I wasn’t playing around. Look at this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why did he need to look at the details of a rake?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel felt doubts and examined the rake.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel was beyond shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Perfect Rake]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 71/71 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 49~61</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Stamina +15</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Dexterity +28</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Greatly improves the soil quality.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A farming equipment suitable for digging at the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An item made by the blacksmith ‘G’ who has a reputation close to a legend.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Despite the use of bad quality iron and wood as the material, its function is outstanding.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The three delicate prongs will make the soil finer, improving soil quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The three prongs are bent at the ideal angle to work the soil.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even a child can use this rake to turn a wasteland into an excellent garden.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 45</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The rake was a tool that helped adult males clear a 1,000 pyeong size land in one day.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the people of Reidan were starving for a long time and their physical condition wasn’t good, so each person could only clear 100 pyeong a day.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The people of Reidan will be able to do more than that if they have this rake. The soil improvement means that the land will give a good harvest.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This game was truly about items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was the truth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel once again thought that it was a good idea to follow Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t doubt that one day, the people of Reidan would be armed with the power of items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then he suddenly got an ominous feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Don’t tell me that when he becomes a king...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Surely he wouldn’t name it Overgeared Kingdom?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel made a tearful face.</span></p>
