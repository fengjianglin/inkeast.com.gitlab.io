 <p><span style="">Chapter 265</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">A golden ceiling and white exterior walls. Three big and ornate buildings like palaces were situated on the hills of Rolling.</span> <span style="">They were in harmony with the forest and landscape. There was a small waterfall behind each building. A golden statue of Rebecca rose in the center.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the center of the Rebecca Church, the most important religion on the continent. This was the Vatican.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Isabel-chan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian returned to the Vatican and sought out Isabel. It was to check her status.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Isabel's health hadn’t improved. No, it was worse.</span> <span style="">She seemed to have completely lost her hearing and vision. There was no reaction when he called from right beside her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cough! Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She coughed up blood. The crumbly platinum hair was pulled off with a single touch, and the skin was pulled tightly over her skull.</span> <span style="">Isabel sat on a shabby bed like a doll without a soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian’s eyes crumbled at the sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dammit... Why is this room always cold…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You came.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A priest with a faint presence approached. His emotionless eyes gave off an ominous feeling but unlike his appearance, he could be trusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was Cassus.</span> <span style="">He had been taking care of Isabel when Damian wasn’t present.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The mission to destroy the Yatan Church found in the west of the empire... I thought you would finish it in 40 days and come back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a week later than expected.</span> <span style="">Goddess' Agent, Damian.</span> <span style="">Maybe his skills didn’t meet everyone’s expectations?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian explained to the concerned Cassus.</span> <span style="">“I accomplished my mission more than a month ago. I was delaying my stay in the Eternal Kingdom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">More than a month ago?</span> <span style="">He spent only a few days destroying one of the Yatan Church’s temples?</span> <span style="">Cassus felt thrilled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"But why the Eternal Kingdom...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I met Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The only person able to seal Lifael’s Spear.</span> <span style="">In the past, he saved the Rebecca Church by bringing down the corrupt Pope Drevigo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"He’s coming here now.”</span> <span style="">Just as he did in the past, he would save Isabel. She would regain her beautiful smile.</span> <span style="">"I will start competing with Pascal in that gap.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was 42 days left until the pope election.</span> <span style="">Damian thought this was sufficient.</span> <span style="">Thanks to the class effect of Goddess' Agent, many members of the church believed in and followed him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will base the campaign on them, defeat Pascal, and become the pope.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal from the Judar church was the number one candidate.</span> <span style="">He was politically strong and experienced. He also had the honor of being 5th Pope Franz’s direct descendant.</span> <span style="">His father was even an earl of the Saharan Empire.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘But he’s corrupt.’</span> <span style="">He wanted to use the Rebecca Church to strengthen his family’s power.</span> <span style="">‘If he becomes the pope, the Rebecca Church will walk a worse path than when Drevigo was in charge.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Many members of the church already knew this truth.</span> <span style="">Those members would choose Damian for the future of the church.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An innocent Damian believed so.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The elders assembly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were the agency that acted on behalf of the empty vacant pope position. It consisted of 23 of the highest ranking elders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They summoned Damian and ordered.</span> <span style="">"There’s a report that the Yatan followers are active in the Gauss Kingdom. Goddess' Agent, Damian. Immediately go to the Gauss Kingdom, then search and destroy the Yatan Temple.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There are 42 days left until the pope election. I am a pope candidate. You want me to leave during such an important period in the campaign?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian was 30 years old.</span> <span style="">He lived his life in his own way so he lacked social experience. He wasn’t accustomed with such irrational practices.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The elders laughed at his naive self.</span> <span style="">"You can’t do your duties because of the election? You’re confessing your own incompetence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This is a task you should do as a dutiful son... Tsk, how pathetic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You shouldn’t cause trouble with your work just because you are registered as a pope candidate. Why don’t you just resign your candidacy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Or Isabel will do the work.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Being ignored, mocked, provoked and looking at him with contempt.</span> <span style="">It was obvious that the elders assembly were hostile towards Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'They are fully with Pascal. But this is still too much.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian was honestly shocked.</span> <span style="">He was afraid since they opposed him so plainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I was thinking too easily.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian was doing Isabel’s missions to save her.&nbsp;</span> <span style="">On the other hand, the elders assembly were trying to get rid of Isabel.</span> <span style="">They wanted Isabel to die so they could find a new master for Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘In this situation...’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He needed to neglect the campaign for Isabel’s mission?</span> <span style="">If Isabel performed this task, then she would die.</span> <span style="">He couldn’t allow it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian wanted to become a pope for Rebecca’s Daughters.</span> <span style="">He couldn’t throw Isabel away just because of the election.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...I understand. I will go to the Gauss Kingdom immediately.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was desperate.</span> <span style="">This mission included searching for the temple.&nbsp;</span> <span style="">It was doubtful if he could find the Yatan Church before the pope election day.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'In the first place, this temple might not even exist.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an obvious trap.</span> <span style="">But he had no choice. It was impossible to disobey the command if he wanted to protect Isabel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Isabel needs to survive until Grid arrives and seals Lifael’s Spear.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Four days.</span> <span style="">From Reidan to the Vatican, that was how long it took running nonstop.</span> <span style="">Grid had sent a whisper yesterday that he was leaving Reidan, so Isabel needed to survive three more days.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Please.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Step step.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian left the assembly room with powerless steps.</span> <span style="">He inwardly begged.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Please save Isabel-chan, Grid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">By the time he got back, Isabel’s health would be restored. He would be able to see her smile.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Creak.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The gigantic door of the room opened by itself.</span> <span style="">It seemed to be urging Damian to leave.</span> <span style="">The moment that Damian was about to walk out the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Don’t go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A voice he wanted to hear was heard from outside the door.</span> <span style="">Damian’s gaze moved upwards from the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Isabel-chan...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She held Lifael’s Spear in her hand and blocked the door.</span> <span style="">She was standing straight on her own. Her eyes were also clear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the power of White Transformation.</span> <span style="">The transcendental divine power was restoring her broken body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Of course, this was only temporary.</span> <span style="">Now that the spear was in her hand, Isabel would be in greater pain than before. No, she would die.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why...? Why? Why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Three days. She could’ve lived if she waited three days.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“So why...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As Damian felt frustration and despair, Isabel smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Thank you again, Damian.”</span> <span style="">She had dimly heard his cry.</span> <span style="">She knew that he struggled alone for them.</span> <span style="">"You must become the pope.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It must happen.</span> <span style="">If Pascal became the pope, there would be more miserable children like her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Don’t you know this? Damian, you can’t miss the opportunity to become pope because of me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian was well aware of this.</span> <span style="">If he didn’t want the second or third Isabel to be born, he must become the pope.</span> <span style="">Now was the time for Isabel to sacrifice herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘But I don’t want you to die.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Isabel stroked his head as he hesitated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will go to the Gauss Kingdom. In the meantime, you should become the pope. Please succeed for Rin, Luna, and my successor. Be sure to protect those children.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She stroked his hair. It was a bony hand.</span> <span style="">But it was warm.</span> <span style="">Tears formed in Damian’s eyes as he felt Isabel’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then a man laughed at him.</span> <span style="">"Someone who wants to become pope is shedding tears in front of others?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was Pascal.</span> <span style="">He touched his thin mustache and ridiculed Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You truly don’t have the dignity of a pope. It will be a disgrace to the church if this crybaby becomes the pope. Isn't that right, Elders?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Damian is a small bowl."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The pope must be Pascal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 23 elders chimed in to support Pascal. They mocked Damian.</span> <span style="">Then Isabel glared at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Daring to disparage the Goddess' Agent, isn’t this no different from blasphemy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Your attitude is bad. Isabel, the Yatan Church is your enemy, not us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal approached Isabel who was holding Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Know your subject. You have forgotten your position. You are Goddess Rebecca’s daughter only because you can handle the divine artifact of our church. You are only a tool. A weapon of war to fight for the goddess and our church.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal’s eyes were as cold as ice as he faced Isabel. It didn’t seem like the eyes of a person.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Just like this spear, you are a weapon of slaughter. Don’t think and don’t talk. Do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Shut up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian exclaimed. He wanted to beat up Pascal right away.</span> <span style="">But if he did that, he would be immediately kicked out of the church. It would ruin everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian clenched his fists as Pascal looked at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Rebecca’s Daughter, who you love so much, is being abused in front of you. But you are swallowing your anger? You are just a coward who can only shout.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Put away that cheap provocation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian, Isabel and Pascal. The eyes of everyone present widened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You are having a lot of fun after grabbing the weapon point. Is it fun to harass people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">180 cm tall with a solid body.</span> <span style="">Black hair and sharp eyes.</span> <span style="">The eyes and voice that were filled with confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pagma’s Descendant, Grid.</span> <span style="">He was walking from the other end of the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Multiple people are bullying one person? Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-Why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal and the elders were disturbed by the emergence of an unexpected person. Isabel was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian smiled widely.</span> <span style="">Grid’s appearance was exquisite timing and he patted Damian’s shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You endured well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid arrived at the Vatican much faster than expected thanks to Huroi’s drake.</span> <span style="">He declared to the frowning Pascal and elders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“From now on, I am behind Damian.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Behind?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal couldn’t properly understand Grid’s words.</span> <span style="">Huroi translated it for him.</span> <span style="">"As of this time, I, Duke Grid of the Eternal Kingdom, am the guardian of Damian, the Goddess' Agent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Orator Huroi’s voice was filled with charisma. It pierced through the spacious building and made Pascal and the elders feel sick.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid declared, “Don’t bother him. Or you will be scolded by me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If you ridicule pope candidate Damian again, you will be punished accordingly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Do you have any complaints? Then bring it on, you masses of experience. I’m in a different position from Damian, so I can deal with you as I like.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was hard to wrap their heads around it.</span> <span style="">Even Huroi was speechless as silence filled the room.</span></p>
