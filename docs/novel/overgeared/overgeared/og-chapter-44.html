 <p><span style="">Chapter 44</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Erina’s personality was as angelic as her looks.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A really good girl.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As I was feeling thrilled, she spoke.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I have a condition instead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Indeed, it was rare for a girl to be pretty and have a good heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oof! Oooof!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This damn girl! Setting a condition in a situation like this? If she came to rescue me, shouldn’t she rescue me? Erina interpreted my expression and laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You will listen to any conditions, so talk quickly? It’s good that you are so straightforward. You will make an orb for me that contains as much magic as possible. At a minimum, the orb should have the same performance as this dagger. You can do it with your blacksmith skills, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Orb? I had never created one before.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was an orb a magic item? Why is she asking me, not a magician…? No, now wasn’t the time to think about that.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Erina made a satisfied expression.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Okay. The other condition is that you can never call me ‘kid’ in the future. My name is Euphemina. Just call me Euphemina. Understood?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Did she drink alcohol during the day? Earlier she was Erina and now she was Euphemina? Did she forget her name?&nbsp;</span><span style="">... Or was it a pseudonym in the first place?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Anyway, this was good.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I nodded again and Erina, no Euphemina took out a key and opened the prison door. Then she released the gag in my mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Puak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I finally felt alive again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I wiped the saliva around my mouth and asked Euphemina to release my tied up body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is happening? Why did you come here to save me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina threw the dagger towards me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Isn’t it better to talk once we escape?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As she finished talking, there was the sound of dozens of soldiers rushing down the stairs.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was dismayed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hey, Kid...no, Euphemina, what is this? Didn’t you manage to come here because you took care of the soldiers?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There are a lot of soldiers. I took care of over 100 soldiers, but there are still people remaining. You’ll have a hard time escaping.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pfff!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I let out a laugh at Euphemina’s ridiculous words. Euphemina glared at me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why are you laughing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I’m laughing because you said you took care of over 100 soldiers. How can a blacksmith fight so well? Yes? You should bluff more moderately...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I'm not a blacksmith."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina faced me. Her deep blue eyes were as beautiful as any jewel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Although, she was still a kid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Well, if she ate a lot of rice and her breasts grew bigger, then I might be attracted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Where are you looking?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina covered her breasts and asked with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I'm not interested in small breasts, so don’t worry about it. You aren’t a blacksmith? What do you mean?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I really dislike people like you.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina grumbled, but still explained.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I have a special class. My class is a Duplicator. I was able to pretend to be a blacksmith by duplicating Khan’s blacksmith skill. You are like me, right? You’re not an ordinary blacksmith?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Duplicator?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the first time I’d heard of this class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Perhaps...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A rare class?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina cried out indignantly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“It isn’t a rare class! It’s an epic class!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Heok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One of Satisfy’s three epic classes belonged to this kid?&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was no reason for her to bluff in this situation, so if this was true...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Didn’t you thoroughly hide your identity? Then why bother revealing it to me? And why in this situation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I am saying it now because of this situation. Don’t you have a hidden class as well? I know everything. So don’t pretend to be an ordinary blacksmith, and fight with all your abilities. Otherwise you’ll be killed here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I was already planning on that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I nodded with a convinced expression and held the dagger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Due to your class characteristics, you have equipped the Ideal Dagger.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[This is an item you created. Your understanding is 100%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[In the case of items made by you, a penalty will be applied if you don’t meet the item usage requirements, even if you have full understanding.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Attack power of the Ideal Dagger will decrease by 20%. Only half of the option effects will be applied.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Ideal Dagger]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 168/168 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 242~264 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Speed: +11%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* There is a rare chance of instantaneously killing the target.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Agility +20</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The skill ‘Wind Blast’ is generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The skill ‘Quick Movements’ is generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A dagger created by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but lacks experience and reputation. It was made with the renowned blacksmith Khan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There is nothing special about the materials or method used, but the craftsman’s skill and the co-operation with Khan has created an ideal dagger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 180 or higher. More than 450 agility.&nbsp;Advanced Dagger Mastery.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The penalties would be applied even if I had the maximum understanding of the items I created!? Dammit! This was truly deplorable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'But the penalty of a unique item is only 20%? Still, this is nice.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina was astonished as she saw me equip the dagger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is your real class part of the assassin series? It requires 450 agility and Advanced Dagger Mastery... But isn’t it strange? How do you have the blacksmith’s craftsmanship technique?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I noticed when she told me to produce the orb, but Euphemina must’ve seen the information about this dagger. However, she wasn’t greedy and returned it to me. When I looked at her, she was a pretty good person.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If it was me, I wouldn’t taken it... She’s stupid. Truly a little kid who doesn’t know the truth of the world. No, she wants me to make an orb that is as good as this dagger? Wait... Will she support the cost of the materials needed to make the orb? S-Surely she isn’t expecting me to make it for free? W-Wicked girl...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No, it was still too early to know.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I had time to make a decision about Euphemina.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wind Blast.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I used the skill in the direction of the rushing soldiers. A sharp wind emerged from the dagger, causing blood to pour from the soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina confirmed that 10 soldiers were seriously wounded and whistled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A skill attached to an item manages to display this much destructive power, how incredible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Originally, the destructive power wasn’t at this level.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If I met the conditions to use this dagger, the power of Wind Blast would’ve been two times stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is a pity that only half of the option’s effect is applied.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I lamented again before speaking to Euphemina.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hey Euphemina, I have to go rescue a person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh? A person? Ah, are you talking about Khan? I already rescued Khan before coming here...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Khan was also captured? I’m glad he’s safe. But the person I’m talking about isn’t Khan. It’s Huroi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Who is that?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I briefly explained to Euphemina, who made an annoyed expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I don't know the name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I could read Euphemina’s feelings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She seemed to think she had stepped in shit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Well, it didn’t matter how she felt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was only 1 hour and 50 minutes remaining.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I had to rescue Huroi during that time period!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘After I save that bastard, I will tell him off.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was the cause of all of this. I was furious.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wahhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soldiers jumped in unison.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There seemed to be around 30 soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was nervous, but Euphemina didn’t show any signs of agitation at all. She didn’t change her expression and reached out a hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Spear of Destruction.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pachichik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A dark red spark jumped from Euphemina’s fingertip. A spear was created and the soldiers were hit.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Bam bam bam!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The spear pierced the bodies of the soldiers and exploded, causing the 30 soldiers to turn into a grey light.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an incredibly powerful spell that was used lightly. Maybe Euphemina was comparable to that witch Yura?&nbsp;</span><span style="">How could she cast it so easily?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hiccup!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I hiccuped from the surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What did I say to her before? Didn’t I say a lot? Is she angry with me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As I froze with fear, Euphemina said to me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What? Don’t you have to go and rescue Huroi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Y-Ye...s.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was going to speak casually, but suddenly thought that it would be awkward not to use honorifics.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Let’s never call her a kid again. I will make her orb. She has endured it so far. I won’t offend her anymore.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I made a decision and headed deeper underground.</span></p>
