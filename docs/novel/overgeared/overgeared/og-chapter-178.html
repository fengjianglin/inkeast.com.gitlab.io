 <p><span style="">Chapter 178</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The National Competition’s second day.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After the target processing, the siege and treasure hunt were held in succession.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Nothing strange happened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo didn’t play a further role in the South Korean team.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t participate in the siege or treasure hunt, so South Korea was naturally one of the weakest out of the 17 countries participating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But honestly, it was surprising.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura participated in the siege.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo hoped that South Korea would get a good record in the siege, but the result was disastrous.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Korean team’s waiting room.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Korean players apologized to Yura after coming back from the game.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were embarrassed by their inability to help the team. A few young teenagers on the team had tears in their eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Everyone felt frustrated and humiliated after being defeated by the foreign players in the game.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But what could they do?&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was reality.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The rankers of the Korean team were in the 800~1000s, while the rankers of other teams were in the top 200.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The power gap was too great.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura alone was unable to cover this difference.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We held onto Yura’s ankle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I...! If only I was a little bit stronger...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The players couldn’t lift their heads.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura encouraged them,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"You don’t have to blame yourself. You did your best, as people have witnessed. None of you are to blame.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The beautiful and kind Yura seemed like an angel to the players.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo looked at her smile and felt furious.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Those Yankee scum.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The US were angry after receiving a silver medal in the target processing because of Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As if they wanted to pay back their grudge, they persistently attacked the Korean castle at the start of the siege.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">South Korea had a weak overall power and couldn’t endure the American offensive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura struggled, but the other players couldn’t properly assist her. The walls quickly fell apart and the Korean players were logged out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was okay up to here.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The world of war was heartless.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was natural for the strong to defeat others.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But an American player showed excessive behavior.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was someone with the ID of ‘Primal.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">He survived towards the end of Yura’s resistance and tore the Korean flag that had been flying from the castle.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Ripping the official flag of another country?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was terrible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The backlash generated was very large.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even his fellow Americans refused to forgive the actions of Primal. Zibal apologized as the US representative, but that couldn’t stop the criticism of public opinion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, Primal was asked to take responsibility and was deprived of his qualifications. He was unable to participate in the National Competition anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But the anger of the Koreans had already reached the extreme.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Primal was a problem, but there were also some American players who laughed while watching Primal’s behavior.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A small number of Koreans hated the entire US team.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo was the same.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had served in the army and was a reservist, so seeing the flag being ripped was a great shock to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That shitty guy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That Primal, if Youngwoo met him someday in Satisfy, then he would make Primal pay.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The US team?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would pay back the disgrace and despair felt by the Korean team in today’s siege.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He gritted his teeth while pledging, and then Yura approached him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That’s it for today’s schedule. I will go back now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You, are you okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura fought harder than anyone else.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there was a limit to what she could do alone, and she eventually lost.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She should be the most disappointed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura laughed at Youngwoo’s anxious question.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“It would be a lie if I say that I’m okay. But I'm not frustrated. I will grow even more from today’s defeat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura was already looking ahead.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Next year and the year after that, she would make sure there was a different result in the National Competition. She made a pledge.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'She truly is the 5th ranked user.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo was amazed. There was a group waiting for the two people as they left the waiting room.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were Jishuka, Regas and Pon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Please show us around Korea.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The three people’s eyes shone like lanterns.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were full of excitement to have Youngwoo accompany them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Please guide me to a Taekwondo theme park.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No, what nonsense are you saying? Of course, we should visit a place with a lot of beauties. Let’s go to the hottest club.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Please play among yourselves. I’ll just enjoy my time with Grid alone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo was troubled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had no friends and no experience with dating.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, he didn’t know any good places to recommend to foreigners visiting South Korea for the first time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He finally made a decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let’s eat a meal first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I agree!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will contact a restaurant.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura naturally intruded. Youngwoo, Jishuka and the rest of the group rode her limousine to the restaurant she recommended.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why is this woman going with us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo didn’t want to lose his mind to Jishuka, so he thought it was better for Yura to join them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“An interpreter is required.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo didn’t speak English, so he couldn’t communicate with Jishuka.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he didn’t get any help from Yura, who was fluent in eight languages, he wouldn’t be able to communicate properly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"An interpreting device is inconvenient. Isn’t it also good to build up a relationship with Yura?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t forget that the Yatan Church is our main enemy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It will be easier to deal with the Yatan Church if she cooperates. Think positively.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hrmm..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura was able to join the party with Youngwoo’s continued persuasion. Then she made a series of incorrect translations at the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid, do you know? The reason I participated in this National Competition was because I wanted to see you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Jishuka said that she joined the National Competition for the honor of her country.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"South Korea seems better to live in than Brazil. I would love to live here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Jishuka said that she doesn’t like South Korea. She doesn’t want to come back here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Hey, this wily girl. You are properly interpreting what I’m saying, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It is hard to translate the whines of a pig.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Damn Yatan servant...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo was sitting between Jishuka and Yura in the restaurant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the two people suddenly started arguing in English.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He tried to get help from Regas and Pon, who always helped him in Satisfy but...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Delicious!”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Regas was busy tasting all the Korean dishes on the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why don’t you take off your apron and embrace me?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pon was awkwardly hitting on the employees in English.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Are these really the people I know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo felt a sense of distance from Regas and Pon. Both seemed so different from Satisfy that he felt confused.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The chaos grew over time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“G~r~i~d!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Youngwoo.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura and Jishuka became drunk while they were arguing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a tremendous burden for Youngwoo to take care of two drunk girls alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wanted to ask Pon and Regas for help, but Pon had left with a woman, while Regas found a Taekwondo dojo and challenged the owner to a spar.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Buzz buzz.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow, amazing. Isn’t that Jishuka and Yura?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oh my, look! Grid! Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow... What are the three of them doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The people on the street gathered around Youngwoo. They took lots of photos.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Ah, this, really...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka and Yura were drunk and sticking like gum to Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If this continued, there might be a misunderstanding and Youngwoo might be dragged to the police station.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was his first experience with drunk girls, so Youngwoo imagined the worst. Then he hurriedly caught a passing taxi.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Where do you want to go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo spoke flatly to the driver.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“My house.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...The address.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo left in the taxi with the two women.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This action caused all types of misunderstandings.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A few minutes later.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reports from the witnesses caused speculative stories to be written on the Internet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[(Photo News) The drunk Yura and Jishuka took a taxi with Grid.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[According to witness statements, Yura and Jishuka were on the verge of fainting.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[What is the destination of the three people?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[(Scene Coverage) I am currently at OO Hotel where Jishuka is staying. It is almost dawn and she hasn’t returned yet.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[What is Grid doing now?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Oh my, who are these girls?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo’s parents had been watching his son’s appearance on TV all day.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were pleasantly surprised when Youngwoo brought young women home.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their son, who never brought friends home, now brought two beauties at once?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hum hum.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo’s father felt embarrassed and went into his room after clearing his throat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then his mother paid serious attention to Youngwoo,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Son, are you prepared for this? I don’t think South Korea is open enough to welcome two daughter-in-laws at once.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo’s face flushed with embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No, Mother’s words are true. But isn’t this a misunderstanding? If I was going to do that, would I have brought them home? Wouldn’t I go to another place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hohoho, yes, yes. I’ll bring a blanket so lay them down in your room. Youngwoo, you sleep in the living room today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo’s mother entered her room to get a quilt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the meantime, Youngwoo was taking off his shoes and he looked up Yura and Jishuka’s skirts.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t intended, but instinctive behavior.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The low~est.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee came out of her room at that time and looked at him with contempt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo felt like crying as he lost his dignity in front of his sister.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The National Competition’s third day.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The production events were held.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The crowd cheered as production rankers in various fields such as blacksmiths, tailors and alchemists appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There’s no Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The crowd checked their faces and started to sulk.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was a legendary blacksmith, so they naturally thought he would participate in the production events. They were excited at the thought of possibly seeing a legendary item be created.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Grid didn’t attend.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is he forfeiting because of last night’s scandal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Thanks to that, the other blacksmiths have a chance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"By now, Grid must be with Jishuka and Yura...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah! My desire for murder is boiling!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was rife with all types of speculations.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Youngwoo didn’t avoid the production events because he was conscious of people’s eyes. It wasn’t because of Yura and Jishuka.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because a person was limited to participating in three events.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo wanted to participate in events that would have a huge dominance on the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">These were the events:</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“PvP and pet marathon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The two events held on the fifth day weren’t a team event, but a solo exhibition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hopefully, one country could win six medals.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Experts speculated that the US would earn a large number of medals on that day and consolidate their first place ranking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo wouldn’t allow it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t celebrate too early.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He would hit them properly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo decided and got up from his seat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he opened his door as usual to play Satisfy and was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He witnessed the appearance of Yura and Jishuka sleeping next to each other on his bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Pfft!!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo had a nosebleed at the sight of the two beauties.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They came back late last night. He didn’t know what to do, but then Yura and Jishuka woke up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After that.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo’s house was crowded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura and Jishuka were very friendly after meeting Youngwoo’s parents.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Let me help you prepare the meal, Mother.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Oh my, thank you. Huh...? Why are you washing eggs and rice with detergent?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Father~ I’ll give you a massage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Oh my, thank you. Thanks to my son... Heok! M-My back...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura was polite and Jishuka was bright.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Both of them had a problem of being too enthusiastic, but they appealed to Youngwoo parents' affection well enough. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo felt like he was sitting on a thorn cushion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because Sehee kept on shooting glares at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Sightseeing? Ah, yes. We haven’t gone anywhere for a long time, so let’s make it a family trip.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"So, how great is our Youngwoo? He’s a hero on TV, a hero in a game I don’t know about ~ I don’t know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Two days passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the 5th and final day of the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The PvP was scheduled to be in the morning and the pet marathon in the afternoon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Okay."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura and Jishuka had stayed at Youngwoo’s house for two days.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo arrived at the stadium to enthusiastic cheers and curses.</span></p>
