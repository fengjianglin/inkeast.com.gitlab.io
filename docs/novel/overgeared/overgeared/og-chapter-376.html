 <p><span style="">Chapter 376</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A haze spread around Grid’s body and there was a faint light as he started a sword dance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The first legendary class in Satisfy demonstrated absolute dominance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Transcended Link.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">20 red-black energy blades filled with strength flooded towards Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The sight caused the billions of people watching the video to hold their breath.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Sururuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel avoided them with minimal movements, neared Grid, and his white sword moved in a curved line.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid defended like he was waiting for it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The camera shook as the two swords hit each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then it changed to a black and white screen with 2XX3.10.27 on it.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the opening video that announced the date and time of the 2nd National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Great.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It’s cool, really cool.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">The opening of a game should taste like this.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Something is bubbling up inside me.</span></i> <i><span style="">It’s much cooler than the Demon Hero movies.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Everybody has different tastes ^^. I prefer the Demon Hero movies.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The public’s interest in the opening video of the 2nd National Competition was hot.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Among them, the Korean people were enthusiastic about the existence of Yura and Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yura and Peak Sword are in position with the Overgeared members.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">When did they join Overgeared?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">There is continuous breaking news.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-Wow...</span></i> <i><span style="">I never imagined that Yura and Peak Sword would join Overgeared.</span></i> <i><span style="">Grid’s forces seem truly unique.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-It is likely that there are eight main guilds in Satisfy now, not seven.</span></i> <i><span style="">The existing seven guilds and Overgeared.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-Isn’t Peak Sword the master of the Silver Knights?</span></i> <i><span style="">Did the Silver knights merge with Overgeared?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It’s likely.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">We can think of Overgeared as a Korean guild.</span></i> <i><span style="">Their master is Korean and most of the guild members are Korean.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-Kya ~ ~!</span></i> <i><span style="">Do you know Overgeared?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Hah...</span></i> <i><span style="">Yura and Jishuka are really pretty.</span></i> <i><span style="">I will have no other wishes in my life if I can meet them once once.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">No, it’s absurd to get both of them </span></i><span style="">ㅡㅡ </span><i><span style="">Choose one of the two</span></i><span style="">ㅡㅡ</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">He’s even a couple in the game with Irene. Ah, I’m so envious.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">People can get everything if they are successful in their field.</span></i> <i><span style="">I will try my best when it comes to writing comments on the Internet as well. ^^</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Then I guess I only have Satisfy from now on.</span></i> <i><span style="">I will be like Grid and buy an 800 million won car.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I’ve been only playing Satisfy since it opened, but I’m still level 250 ㅎㅎㅎ. I can’t be Grid.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Fun.</span></i> <i><span style="">The users with levels above 250 should comment here.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The dignity of Grid and Overgeared were clearly communicated to the Korean people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Lauel’s intention.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, contrary to Lauel’s intentions, the people of other countries were concentrating on something else.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-Wow...</span></i> <i><span style="">Kraugel will participate in the competition.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yes.</span></i> <i><span style="">I thought he would stick to the mysterious concept for the rest of his life.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It isn’t a mysterious concept. He just focuses on levelling up to the end.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I wonder why Kraugel is participating in the tournament?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Of course, he must covet the prizes.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Now that Grid’s reputation is growing to a level that can threaten him, his pride means he has come to show the difference in skill.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Indeed...</span></i> <i><span style="">Kraugel is in a different class.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-What are you saying </span></i><span style="">ㅡㅡ </span><i><span style="">Grid has shown many times what he can achieve, their classes are too different.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">What nonsense. Don’t you see how easily Kraugel avoided Grid’s skill?</span></i><i><span style="">Kraugel is a wall.</span></i> <i><span style="">I don’t mean to ignore Grid, but Kraugel is too great.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">What are you saying?</span></i> <i><span style="">How do you know Kraugel managed to avoid Grid’s skill?</span></i> <i><span style="">You can’t distinguish between reality and directing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">You don’t believe Kraugel’s skills?</span></i> <i><span style="">In the old days, rankers shot videos of Kraugel hunting and his control ability exceeded common sense.</span></i> <i><span style="">Search on Mytube.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Ah, that video...</span></i> <i><span style="">It had over a billion hits.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel’s face distorted as he confirmed the public’s reaction.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Public interest was focused on Grid and Kraugel, not Grid and Overgeared, so his initial intention to maximize the existence of Overgeared was broken. He was upset.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is because of Kraugel.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He wondered why the S.A. Group listened to their request, but it was because there was this motivation behind it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is bad.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The opening was a secondary problem.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel planned to impress the public with the Overgeared Guild by having the members win a medal in each event.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now he might miss it due to the variable called Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Considering Kraugel’s inclinations, he is likely to participate in PvP, raid, and the siege.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The gold medals in the three most popular events in the National Competition were very valuable.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, as long as Kraugel existed, it was realistic for the Overgeared members to give up on the gold medal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'...No, not if it’s Grid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">According to Grid, the reason he could win against Kraugel was because Kraugel wasn’t in a perfect condition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Lauel believed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The sky isn’t untouchable.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Snow, rain, thunder, and typhoons would pour down, but the sky wouldn’t fall.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel knew that Kraugel shouldn’t have been knocked down, even if he was in an imperfect condition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid being able to break down the sky, it wasn’t a coincidence or a miracle...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is skills.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel clenched his fists and started to write a letter to someone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was someone who always tried to change the worst crisis into an opportunity.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Genius at fighting’ Hao.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The millions of Chinese people were thrilled and enthusiastic when he expressed his intention to participate in the 2nd National Competition, since he didn’t participate in the first one.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They expected to see China ranked first in the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, Hao was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘...Kraugel.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His only object of reverence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I didn’t think you would participate in this tournament.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao’s expression was already tense and sweat was trickling down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Can I play an active role against Kraugel?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hao was sure of it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would never be able to reach the faraway sky that was Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then a homing pigeon flew towards him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The sender was Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The chief of staff of Overgeared wrote the letter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You didn’t accept my friend request, so I can’t send you a whisper. Thus, I had to send a letter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You are the first person to not accept the best of the 10 Rookies and the brains of Overgeared’s request.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This provocative attitude stimulated the other soul in my heart...]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Omitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao quickly skimmed down the nonsense and found the main point.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Do you remember the promise that you made in the past? If my lord, Grid, breaks down the sky and becomes a new sky, you will spread your wings and fly into Grid’s arms.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao distinctly remembered it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The seven guilds failed to invade Reidan because they were crushed by farmers, and Hao was forced to retreat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hao received an offer to serve Grid in exchange for his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that time, Hao said that the only thing to hold a dragon was a sky, and of course, that sky was Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid would break Kraugel?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s impossible.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao crumpled up the letter.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He acknowledged Grid’s skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had appropriate control and exceptional items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The current Grid was one of the top rankers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he was nothing compared to Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Someone who can’t overcome me won’t be able to beat Kraugel.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The more he thought about it, the more absurd it was.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hao’s chest burned hot when he thought about Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It would be good to make them understand their target.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Overgeared Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would let them know that the world was very narrow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hao’s golden eyes became determined to prove it.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid and the Overgeared members escaped from the 9th vampire city with the help of Sage Sticks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had a busy day with various media interviews and filming the opening video of the National Competition. Now they gathered in Reidan after a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ba! Baba!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lord toddled forward and greeted them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was moved to tears by the appearance of his big son.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is he calling me papa? Didn't you hear?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was exciting for Grid, but the other Overgeared members didn’t show much reaction.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ba! Bababa!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lord used the same title for all the Overgeared members, not just Grid!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok... Surely you haven’t forgotten your dad after not meeting for so long?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid turned blue with shock.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lord turned his gaze away from the one who couldn’t hide his sadness and smiled meaningfully.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kasim watched him in the darkness and shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A little baby is already teasing an adult...’</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid shared the joy of a reunion with Irene and left the bedroom.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He observed the sleeping Lord with the Great Lord's Sword and was astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Name: Lord Steim</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Age: 0 years &nbsp;Gender: Male</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Occupation: Young Nobleman</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Title: Grid’s Son</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The son of a legendary blacksmith. He has inherited most of his father’s abilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Title: Genius of the Continent</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* A genius that represents one continent. He overwhelms national geniuses, and his level and abilities will rise 60% faster than normal. In addition, he can acquire skills in a wide range of fields.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, there is a limit to the level and abilities that can be raised until he is 15 years old.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Title: One who Will Become a Legend</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A person who will leave his name in history. There is an 80% chance of being immune to all status effects and illnesses. When attacked, if his health falls to 1 point, he will enter the immortal state for 2.5 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level: 3</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Strength: 40 &nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 45</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Agility: 54 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligence: 47</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dexterity: 90 &nbsp;Charm: 100</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dignity: 17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insight: 80</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skills: Beginner Blacksmith Skill (F), Beginner Weapons Mastery (C), Daluka’s Methods (A+) Discerning Eyes (S), Overwhelming Charm (S), Lantier’s Method (SS), Famous and Legendary Pedigree (SS). </span></p>
 <p><span style="">His mother is the successor of a noble family in the Eternal Kingdom and his father is a legend.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He has inherited all of his parent’s strengths, so his potential is outstanding. Teaching him will be inspiring.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, his talent and environment are so good that he is likely to become arrogant. Education will determine his history.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There is a title change and two more skills?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">According to Irene, Lord had received constant discipline during the month when Grid was away.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t surprising that his level and stats rose slightly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But why did ‘Genius of Eternal’ change to ‘Genius of the Continent?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It meant an increase in potential. There must’ve been a reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What on earth happened?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Daluka's Methods and Lantier’s Methods.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was also nervous about the high ratings of the newly acquired skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, Lantier’s Methods was a huge SS grade, meaning it was a legendary skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Who is the discipline teacher...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How was he teaching to make a monster like this?&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was completely...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A profit.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid sent a whisper to Rabbit, telling him to raise the discipline teacher’s salary.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to this, the wages of the discipline teacher rose from the minimum wage by 1 silver.</span></p>
