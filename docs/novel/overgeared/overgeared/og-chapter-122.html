 <p><span style="">Chapter 122</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">"Rin, shouldn’t you be faithful to me and Goddess Rebecca, as well as serve as a role model to the believers?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Vatican.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dozens of senior paladins and priests watched as one of Rebecca’s Daughters, Rin was questioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She declared,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“This is a misunderstanding.&nbsp;My loyalty to Goddess Rebecca and Your Holiness is eternal.&nbsp;I will never betray Your Holiness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If you are loyal, why haven’t you responded to my calls?&nbsp;Shouldn’t you obey my commands in any circumstances?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Last January.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Drevigo rose to the seat of 13th pope after defeating the other candidates, and revealed himself as soon as he seized power.&nbsp;Almost two years after he became a pope, he broke the laws to fill his own self-interests and defiled the honor of Goddess Rebecca.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The high priests were remorseful and tried to correct their mistake, but they weren’t successful.&nbsp;Those who made any comments were demoted to temples in remote areas.&nbsp;Only those who didn’t care and became corrupt with the pope remained at the Vatican.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Reform was needed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Finally, September of this year.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The high-ranking clergymen rebelled in order to remove Drevigo from the pope’s seat.&nbsp;But Drevigo had Rebecca’s Daughters.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were absolutely loyal to the pope and the rebellion failed before their strength. After that, Drevigo was able to consolidate his position even more.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The priests lamented.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Three of the strongest paladins fostered to guard the church were now protecting the worst pope.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As long as Rebecca’s Daughters existed, the pope would remain alive until the end and the Rebecca Church would rot.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But now.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Due to Drevigo’s endless desires, even Rebecca’s Daughters could feel the change.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Those who had been taught to be absolutely loyal to the pope from a young age were trying to escape their brainwashing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I...&nbsp;I felt confused because Your Holiness didn’t fulfill your duties as a pope.&nbsp;I prayed to Goddess Rebecca to see if I should submit to your commands and to ask for answers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rin was strong but she was pure, like a little girl.&nbsp;The pope ridiculed her for answering so honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You wondered if you should submit to my commands?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why are you so simple?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">The pope’s eyes widened as he shouted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I am the agent of Goddess Rebecca!&nbsp;It is your duty to believe and follow me. Are you trying to use prayer as an excuse?&nbsp;Rin!&nbsp;You are a dangerous child!&nbsp;You are no longer my daughter!&nbsp;I will reclaim Ikael’s Sword!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that moment, a quest notification window appeared in front of Damian, who was standing next to the high-ranking paladin and priest NPCs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Pope’s Decision]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Difficulty Level: SS</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rebecca's Daughters are the absolute weapons of the Rebecca Church.&nbsp;Their armed strength is reliable, but they can be dangerous if they aren’t under perfect control.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The pope is worried about the worst and eventually gave a command.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kill Rebecca’s Daughter, Rin.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Killing her won’t deal a direct hit to the church.&nbsp;As long as Ikael’s Sword exists, an endless number of substitutes can replace her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Conditions: Rin’s death.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Clear Reward: Abilities awakening.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* You can exert the true abilities of a paladin of the Rebecca Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Failure: Level -4.&nbsp;Divine Power will decrease by 10,000.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Would you like to accept the quest?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were three types of paladins in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The most popular type of paladins were those belonging to the Judar Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They specialized in a wide range of buff skills and had excellent defense.&nbsp;They were in charge of the party buffs, and were active in party hunting and raised because they were able to serve as the main tanker.&nbsp;They were considered as the most popular class after the Rebecca priests.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then there were the paladins of the Dominion Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They specialized in personal buff skills and had high attack power.&nbsp;They weren’t popular with large scale parties and raids, but they were popular in small party hunting. In addition, their single combat ability was the best among the paladins.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The last were paladins of the Rebecca Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were the only paladins who could use Heal.&nbsp;But they didn’t have buff skills.&nbsp;However, their amount of healing wasn’t high, so they weren’t popular in party hunting or raids.&nbsp;It was a class that was only grudgingly accepted when a priest couldn’t be found.&nbsp;They had no buff skills and their combat ability was the weakest among the paladins.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were much harder to find than paladins of other churches, and weren’t popular.&nbsp;It was rare to find a user who was a paladin of the Rebecca Church.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But wasn’t it strange?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rebecca’s Daughters were paladins, and not only that, they were the strongest among all NPC paladins.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to their presence, Damian speculated that a Rebecca paladin would become stronger if they broke through a certain point.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If he reached his second advancement, wouldn’t he become stronger than paladins of other churches?&nbsp;He thought for a bit before choosing to become a paladin of the Rebecca Church.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he reached level 200 after much difficulty and didn’t find anything special.&nbsp;The paladins of the other churches were still better than paladins of the Rebecca Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian felt extreme disappointment and skepticism.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Abilities awakening...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the reward of his first SS-grade quest after playing Satisfy for over a year.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If this quest was cleared and his abilities awakened, Damian was obviously going to become stronger as he originally anticipated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian had been waiting for this moment since he became a paladin of the Rebecca Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He made a decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...I reject.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[If you refuse the quest, the pope will view you as a traitor.&nbsp;Do you still want to reject?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was a paladin of the Rebecca Church.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian had struggled to raise his level and divine power.&nbsp;Everyone laughed and called Rebecca’s paladins garbage, but Damian didn’t stop dreaming of the day his abilities would awaken.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then a month ago, he became 2nd on the paladin rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a result of the effort that other people couldn’t imagine, he was finally faced with the moment his abilities would awaken. So why was he refusing the quest?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"How can I aim a sword at Rin-chan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was due to his virtuous heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian had been watching Rebecca’s Daughters for a long time, and was attracted by their beauty and charm.&nbsp;He ran a blog on the Internet praising Rebecca’s Daughters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t underestimate my virtue...!&nbsp;I refuse the quest!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The quest was refused.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[An angry Pope Drevigo has pointed you out as a traitor.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Disgraceful person!&nbsp;What are you doing?&nbsp;Get rid of him and Rin!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Dozens of senior paladins simultaneously armed themselves.&nbsp;They rushed towards Rin and Damian after receiving the pope’s command.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ah...!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rin was confused.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She had been branded as a traitor after a lifetime of loyalty, so she had no idea what to do.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian ran to her side and reassured her,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Rin-chan, it will be okay.&nbsp;I will protect you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Excluding the time he spent playing Satisfy, Damian spent all his time managing his blog and watching Japanese anime.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now he had an opportunity to defend the heroine, just like the protagonists of the animes he watched.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rin was tearful as she looked at his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Damian...&nbsp;I’m not alone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian glanced at her and replied.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Yes.&nbsp;I am beside Rin-chan.&nbsp;And Goddess Rebecca will surely protect us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that moment, a new quest window emerged in front of Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Goddess’ Divine Punishment]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Difficulty: Class change quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Your choice to reject the corrupt pope’s command wasn’t wrong.&nbsp;Goddess Rebecca has blessed you.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As an agent of Goddess Rebecca, punish the corrupt pope!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Progress Reward: Abilities awakening.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Conditions: Pope Drevigo’s death.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Reward: The hidden class ‘Goddess’ Agent.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Failure: Level -20.&nbsp;You will lose your current class.&nbsp;The complete corruption of the Rebecca Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The hidden class change quest has the power to transform Satisfy’s world, according to the result.&nbsp;Please be careful.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Goddess Rebecca has blessed you for following her teachings faithfully.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Due to this, your suppressed powers have been awakened.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[All stats have increased by 100.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The skill ‘Light’s Blessing’ has been generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The skill ‘Heart’s Desire’ has been generated.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style=""></span></i></p>
 <p><i>Kkuok!</i></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian gripped his sword tightly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Duguen!</span></i><i><span style="">Duguen!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">His heart was thudding.&nbsp;His blood was boiling. It was the first time in 32 years that his adrenaline rose like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I chose this.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Reality was different from manhwa.&nbsp;The main characters in manhwa were rewarded for their effort, but reality was grim.&nbsp;It was a world that was only beneficial to those who studied or had money.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In reality, Damian couldn’t be a protagonist.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Satisfy was another reality, and his efforts and choices were repaid, giving him a chance to become a hero.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Drevigo!&nbsp;As an agent of Goddess Rebecca, I will deal out divine punishment!&nbsp;Light's Blessing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You and your party’s defense, attack power and accuracy will increase by 80% for 3 minutes.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ohhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian was surrounded by a golden light as he broke through the paladins and reached Drevigo.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Drevigo reached out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"You dare to act as an agent of the goddess in front of me.&nbsp;Do you believe that you can receive a divine message?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Drevigo’s belief in Goddess Rebecca was real.&nbsp;His overwhelming divine power was comparable to Rebecca’s Daughters.&nbsp;The power of light fired from his fingertip easily penetrated Damian’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cough..!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have lost 41% of your health from a single blow.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You can’t regain your mental state.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was this result?&nbsp;</span><span style="">His vision was going crazy.&nbsp;His body couldn’t move the way he wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Indeed, I...&nbsp;I’m not a protagonist.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian fell into a stunned state and was unprotected.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moment the pope was about to launch another attack at him and all his efforts were in vain...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“How funny...&nbsp;I came here to meet the pope, so why is there a quest to destroy the pope?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The doors of the huge room opened without permission and an outsider entered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a man wearing a scruffy cloak and a bizarre skull helmet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Who is it now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A protagonist?&nbsp;I see.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Papapat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">After examining the situation, Grid threw three darts at the pope standing at the end of a long red carpet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Block it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The paladins used their shields to block the darts.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the moment the darts hit the shields, an explosion occurred and smoke emerged.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid used that gap to rescue Damian and Rin from the enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then he suggested to Damian, whose eyes were wide at the suddenly revealed savior,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Invite me into the party.&nbsp;Instead, can I have all the items that the pope drops?&nbsp;I think that is sufficient for saving your life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
