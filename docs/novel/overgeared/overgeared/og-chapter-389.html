 <p><span style="">Chapter 389</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The duration of immortality was 5 seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid would just receive damage if he tried to fight during that time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid planned to secure and maintain a safe distance from the clone until the immortality ended.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Once it finishes, I will immediately attack and finish off the clone.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He would get revenge on the clone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘How is it? Frustrating?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid smiled like a wicked person in the movies or manhwa.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Suddenly, the clone sat down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was confused.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The clone was sitting down and closing his eyes? It was an unexpected development.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is he doing...? It can’t be!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A chill went down Grid’s spine.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because the clone’s complexion started to improve rapidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Meditation!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After obtaining a safe distance from Grid, the clone used Meditation to restore his health and mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He can use Meditation as he likes?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Meditation was a skill that spontaneously occurred when concentration was extremely high.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t a skill that could be used anytime a person wanted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the clone seemed to be the exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Che!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid urgently used Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Transcend.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Every time Grid wielded his sword, an energy blade was fired at the clone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, it took more than three seconds to complete this sequence.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The clone had already recovered some health. In addition, the clone took a super health recovery potion and used Transcend to cancel out Grid’s energy blades.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid realized that his control skills were still lacking.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The clone’s energy blades had a much higher hit ratio than his.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Launching the energy blades while taking evasion action.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an area impossible for him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid tried to think as calmly as possible while being full of wounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There is no need to fret. The clone has lost his immortality.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, Grid still had his immortality. He had more advantages. There was no need to shrink back.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid swapped to Iyarugt and rushed forward.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Chaeeeeeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Iyarugt was the sword that told its master the best route. It would be able to make up for Iyarugt’s lack of control skills. The battle with the clone began in earnest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, this tense fight didn’t last long.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Linked Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The clone’s Meditation skill meant that the cooldown time of the skills was shortened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The clone was able to use the skills faster than Grid, causing the situation to rapidly become disadvantageous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuuack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The God Hands tried to defend Grid, but they were obstructed by the clone’s God Hands.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was hit by Linked Kill and his health quickly depleted. Doran’s Ring didn’t show a big effect, so he entered the immortal state.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The agitated Grid struck the clone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was determined to kill the clone during the five seconds of the immortality passive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the clone easily escaped from Grid using the Fly attached to Braham’s Boots.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid also belatedly swapped from Grid’s Boots to Braham’s Boots, but the distance between them widened considerably.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Master, believe in me! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe reached the clone and swung his paws several times.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Noe’s claws couldn’t completely neutralize the defenses of the enemies, despite being harder than steel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Holy Light Armor set was truly excellent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After a while, the second battle ended with Grid’s defeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered fatal damage!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have died because health has dropped to 0.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have lost 30.6% experience.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your level has dropped to 305.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have lost 10 stat points.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Mission failed!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Exiting the 41st island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Moving to the last save point, the 40th island.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dammit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s fury when he returned to the 40th island wasn’t just because of his level drop.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I got Noe’s help!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, the clone didn’t have Noe.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even so, he lost.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a huge shame.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Have strength, nyang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe said while patting Grid’s shoulder.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was to comfort him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Noe had been with Grid for a long time, so his affinity towards Grid was very high.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Wasn’t Master originally weak and useless, nyang? Don’t be frustrated by one or two losses, nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe used great demons as a criteria for determining strength.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the instinct of a memphis, a beast of hell. From Noe’s position, Grid had always been weak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...That isn’t comforting at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was feeling resentment to Noe when he suddenly had a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sticks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes, Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Are you sure that the 41st island can’t reproduce a memphis?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">According to Sticks’ logic, a memphis was the best creature after a dragon, so the Behen Archipelago couldn’t reproduce it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was a fault here.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Didn’t you say something on the way to the vampire city? The Behen Archipelago can reproduce a great demon and a dragon. So why can’t it reproduce a memphis?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Good question.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sticks smiled and explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The dragons and great demons reproduced by the Behen Archipelago have a common point. Their bodies aren’t complete.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Bodies aren’t complete?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, all the great demons reproduced by the Behen Archipelago were those who had been sealed by Sword Saint Muller...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The gourmet dragon reproduced during Sticks’ trial weren’t really clones. Dragons were heavy on their hips and couldn’t move directly without magic, so the gourmet dragon Reiders was just a fake.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That’s right. Both the great demons and dragons are incomplete beings, so the Behen Archipelago could reproduce them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had another question.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Then the weakened great demons and dragons are less than a memphis?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Maybe if the memphis is an adult?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Adult...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid stared at Noe.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a chubby cat with horns on his forehead and small wings on his back.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now he looked cute, but what if he was an adult?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Will he grow to be like a dragon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sticks looked at Grid and laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No, there will be no big change in his appearance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Um... Then I’m glad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid wanted Noe to always be cute.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were many fans in Noe’s fan club just because of his appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'One day, I will hold a fan meeting for Noe...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He would be very happy if he could get close to the female members and build up a good relationship.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid imagined the bright future before having to face reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Now isn’t the time to be thinking about these things.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The clone on the 41st island was too strong.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid could only use 50% of his own abilities, while the clone could take full advantage of it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t find the answer to win against the clone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It might be possible if my control skills grow dramatically.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Indeed, there was no end to learning.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Once he grew, he would meet stronger enemies who mocked his growth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If only I had as much talent as the Overgeared members.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wouldn’t be necessary to undergo such frequent trials.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The so-called geniuses, their growth rate was so fast that they were able to cope with new trials.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘On the other hand, I...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid received direct teachings from Piaro and grew through the advice of his guild members, but he was still lacking.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was painful and sad that he had no talent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Wait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Let’s look back.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Since when had he been so obsessed with control skills?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It has been since I became aware of Piaro.'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He realized that he needed control to deal with strong enemies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From that day on, he worked hard on improving his control skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But was this really right?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It doesn’t matter if I try as hard as others.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He would only be able to achieve 20%~30% of their skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was too inefficient.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s developed thinking ability came to this conclusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I don’t need to be so obsessed with control.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was he dull-witted?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, he was Pagma's Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I am a legendary blacksmith.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He could create and produce all types of weapons, and use them with no restrictions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Yes, let’s return to the beginning.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The answer was the power of items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s eyes shone as he pulled out tools, including the portable furnace.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s brain spun rapidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘In order to clear the 41st island...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He couldn’t just make a good item.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What would happen if he made a good item?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The clone could also use it, making him stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The item I need right now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A gamble.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In order to pass the trials that couldn’t be overcome with pure talent, Grid had to seek the help of the heavens.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I need to hope that my worst luck also applies to the clone.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid remembered Euphemina’s Rolling Dice skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a skill that could quickly change a situation, either positively or negatively, by randomly generating different effects.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If this could be applied to an item...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Just wait, Clone.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Victory or defeat would be determined by luck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He only needed to beat the clone once.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Blood Carnival.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A guild made up of unofficial rankers, its wickedness was unmatched.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hired murders, raid interference, stealing goods from merchant companies, etc.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Blood Carnival only moved for the sake of money.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The number of players affected by them was unimaginable, including many top rankers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There’s a new request.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Blood Carnival’s master.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A secret existence whose identity was unknown, they smiled from behind a veil.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s to defeat Kraugel in the National Competition. At the time, the person fulfilling the request must have the logo of a particular company stamped on their item.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s a top grade request.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It seems to be a means for corporate advertising. Won’t the price be huge?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel had the myth of being undefeated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What if the world was watching when he was defeated?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The international media would focus on the person who defeated Kraugel, and the company associated with the person would receive an astronomical advertising effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What event?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s good if Kraugel loses in any event. However, the pay will be three times higher if Kraugel is knocked down in the PvP event.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Then of course it has to be PvP.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"But is anyone participating in the National Competition?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I am.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One of the strongest players in the Blood Carnival stepped forward.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His face was full of confidence.</span></p>
