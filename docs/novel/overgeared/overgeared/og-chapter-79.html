 <p><span style="">“Awesome...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pagma’s Swordsmanship was beyond my imagination. The skills’ capabilities and damage was something I could never imagine.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There is one passive skill and multiple active features... I don’t have any mastery skills, so this is really amazing considering my lacking combat skills.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Most classes had passive skills such as Weapons Mastery or Armor Mastery. These passive mastery skills increased the performance of weapons and armor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Pagma’s Descendant didn’t have any mastery skills at all. It was a drawback and an unsatisfactory part of the class.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“But now it’s different.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pagma’s Swordsmanship increased my attack power and chances of a critical hit when deactivated. This had a similar effect to Weapons Mastery.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is also the performance of Intermediate Weapons Mastery...! The effect disappears when the skill is activated, but that isn’t a huge problem. When activated, five active skills are generated.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pagma’s Swordsmanship! It was a skill worthy of a legendary class!&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was now able to take pride in having a legendary class.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Although I’ve been disappointed in some production aspects, my class is fraudulent. But it isn’t a combat class. I can play the role of a tanker due to my high resistance to abnormal conditions, so I can become more fraudulent if my combat skills develop. But...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was one problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"... Why does the skill consume so much mana?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Currently, I had around 500 mana. I was able to obtain this figure because my intelligence increased when steadily making items. I never invested any stats in it, so I wouldn’t even have 100 mana if it wasn’t for that.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Anyway, the bottom line was that I couldn’t freely use all the available skills at the moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Dammit!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Wave. Restraint. Link. Kill. Transcend.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A total of five sword techniques.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The minimum amount of mana required was 300. In particular, Kill consumed 1,200 mana and Transcend consumed 1,800 mana.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In order to use these skills freely, I needed to invest a lot of stat points in intelligence to increase my mana.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But I had never invested any stat points in intelligence since my days as a warrior.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘With magicians, the higher their intelligence, the higher the magic damage. Therefore, they were willing to invest their points in intelligence. But I...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I honestly didn’t want to invest stat points into intelligence.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In my position, focusing my stat points on strength and stamina was ideal. Strength and stamina meant I could spend a long time making items, and my attack power also increased.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But intelligence? Did I have any skills that were influenced by intelligence? Of course not.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I needed to invest in the intelligence stat just to increase my mana!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shit...but I can’t not invest in intelligence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right. It didn’t matter how much I complained. I had no choice but to invest my points into intelligence.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was in order to use the sword skills.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Status window.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Name: Grid</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level: 92 (1,531,400/3,798,000)</span></p>

 <p><span style="">Strength: 775 &nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 523 &nbsp;&nbsp;Agility: 208 &nbsp;Intelligence: 180&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dexterity: 855 &nbsp;Persistence: 210</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Composure: 155 &nbsp;Indomitable: 176 &nbsp;&nbsp;Dignity: 155 Insight: 155</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Courage: 99</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Stat Points: 0</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 9,404/19,700&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">When I entered Kesan Canyon yesterday, I was level 85. After hunting all the monsters in Kesan Canyon, I was now level 92.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And I had 70 stat points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I should’ve left it...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As you could see, I currently had 0 stat points.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why? I invested 70 points into strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It couldn’t be helped, since it made hunting the canyon spiders easier.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The canyon spiders had excellent defense. I increased strength in order to do a little bit more damage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now I regretted it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I should’ve collected the stat points until I got Pagma’s Swordsmanship...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My maximum mana increased by three points every time I gained one point in intelligence. If I still had the 70 stat points from yesterday, I could increase my intelligence and gain a certain amount of mana.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was too bad.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...I need to raise intelligence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was very annoyed at the thought of not being able to use the skills I learned because of a lack of mana.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Who wouldn’t be nervous at not being able to use some skills?&nbsp;</span><span style="">So I made an unusual choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hunting! Level up! Increase intelligence by raising my level! At the minimum, I need enough mana to use Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kill was a skill that deal 1500% of my attack power to a target.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But 1,200 mana was required to use Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In other words, I needed at least 400 points in intelligence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Obtain 400 intelligence through levelling up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">... It was my rough estimate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hah, this sucks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I started hunting for the first time since becoming Pagma’s Descendant in order to obtain Pagma’s Swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I faced the frostlight orcs in the northern snowfields and then the monsters in Kesan Canyon...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the fun taste of hunting after a long time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘That’s right. I became addicted to Satisfy through this taste.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I could feel myself getting stronger through my level increase, and I was proud to see the gold and loot piled up in my inventory.&nbsp;</span><span style="">For the moment, I should stay in Kesan Canyon and keep hunting.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But what was the reality?&nbsp;</span><span style="">For me, hunting was a luxury.&nbsp;</span><span style="">My family was sitting on a pile of debt. My parents and Sehee still couldn’t shake off their anxiety. I needed to make items instead of hunting so that my family could sleep more easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes, I should return to Khan’s smithy quickly. Then I can obtain Dainsleif. Isn’t that good?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I barely suppressed by desire to hunt and left the cave behind the waterfall. I was soothing my sorrow while admiring the stars in the night sky when-</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuwaaah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A roaring sound was heard from the bottom of the waterfall. There was a huge spray of water and I was surrounded by six mermen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“... The fish are shaking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Mermen were male mermaids. But unlike the mermaids in fairy tales, Satisfy’s mermen were very ugly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I frowned as I saw the gills on the mermen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Are you going to dry out on land and choke to death?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A merman in the front waved his trident and shouted threateningly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Don’t worry about that and give me your heart!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Mermen wanted human hearts for nutrition. They were as terrible as their appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Six mermen...’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The mermen adjusted to the natural environment without much difficulty. Therefore, they were distributed throughout the continent. But the mermen living in Kesan Canyon were the most notorious. The mermen of Kesan Canyon had a level of 175, known to be one of the highest levels among the mermen on the continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The mermen are especially strong in the water. There are six of them...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Before I learned Pagma’s Swordsmanship, I would be trying to run away from this place.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But things were different now.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I raised the +8 Ideal Dagger which shone a darker blue in the darkness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">I wasn’t going to give the mermen my heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You want to take my heart? Or should I just eat all of you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A merman snorted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Bah! This human is bluffing.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Swaaah.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The mermen moved on the water at a tremendous speed, like a surfboard meeting a wave.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I waited for them to get close to me. Just before a trident was going to hit my body, “Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Restraint!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the moment, my body started dancing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The blue light radiating from the Ideal Dagger shone in the moonlight as my body moved quietly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“…!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The mermen’s rush stopped, like it was originally a lie. The mermen acted restless and struggled to get away from me.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I hurriedly linked some skills before they could escape from the influence of Restraint.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Blacksmith’s Rage!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Blacksmith’s Rage has been activated. Your attack power and attack speed will increase significantly for 20 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wind Blast!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kyaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The blade of wind scraped against the mermen’s upper bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 3,750 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 3,802 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Mermen had excellent defense on their lower bodies which were covered in scales, but their human upper bodies were weaker. Therefore, attacks on the upper body were very painful.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I attacked in rapid succession before stopping.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Shit, I ran out of mana.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I quickly opened my inventory and took out an inferior mana recovery potion. After confirming that my mana had fully recovered, I deactivated Pagma’s Swordsmanship. Then I used the skill I developed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wind of Justice!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Wind of Justice exerted a powerful destructive blast that couldn’t be compare to Wind Blast. By deactivating Pagma’s Swordsmanship, my attack power and chances of a critical hit increased, making the destructive power more enormous.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Wind of Justice swept over the mermen from side to side, and those struck in the upper body couldn’t even scream.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Quick Movements!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Quick Movements has been activated. Your agility and evasion rate will increase significantly for 1 minute.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Splash splash!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">I suddenly plunged into the mermen. Then I started to slash at their upper bodies with the +8 Ideal Dagger.</span></p>
