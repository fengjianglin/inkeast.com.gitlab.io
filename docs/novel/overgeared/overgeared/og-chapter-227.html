 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">[Grid’s Boots]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 477/477 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 483</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Movement Speed: -10%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Evasion Rate: -7%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Increases defense by 12% against attacks from the bottom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When using a dashing skill, there is a 25% chance of failure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Defense will increase by 15% in dark places.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 1,930</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Good, good. It wasn’t an epic rating.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the past four months, Grid had produced over 630 items, but he hadn’t produced one legendary item. However, he produced five unique rated items, so he was very pleased.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Five unique items out of 630 items... It’s so rare that I was lucky. And honestly, I am reluctant to make any more legendary items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had made eight legendary items after becoming Pagma’s Descendant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he produced two more, a ‘special event’ was likely to occur that would make him feel sick. He would rather make unique items.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The unique rated items aren’t greatly lacking compared to legendary items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 30 young blacksmiths approached Grid who was grinning with satisfaction.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They admired Grid’s Boots.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Duke Grid, this is a work of art!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The degree of completion can’t be described in words!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Such elegance hidden inside a primitive design...! It truly is high quality!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was practically impossible for inferior blacksmiths to understand the work of the legendary blacksmith Grid. They just felt like it was great.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But unlike their current appearance, their potential for development was enormous.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had searched the 20,000 people of Reidan and selected those with excellent qualities, then Khan taught them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The ability of Grid and Khan to closely observe their skills exceeded common sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘At least eight of them are going to become advanced blacksmiths. I will raise new blacksmiths around them.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were people who might’ve become advanced blacksmiths in another city.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had the Blacksmith’s Affection skill, so he wasn’t exaggerating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Blacksmith’s Affection]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Appreciation of the NPC, which is the maximum skill level of the blacksmith, a minimum of 1 and a maximum of up to 5 randomly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The blacksmith who received your teachings will be loyal to you for life and will share with you every time they learn new item production methods.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Anyway, next is the enhancement...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had a passive skill that ‘increased the probability of item enhancement.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">He enhanced Dainsleif to +8 and Failure to +9, so Grid wanted to try strengthening these boots to at least +8.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I’m aiming to use the Grid set for a long time, so I want to try enhancement...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">To do this, he needed enhancement stones.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the price of the enhancement stones was rising.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At the present time, the price of a general enhancement stone was 180 gold and a blessed enhancement stone was 2,500 gold.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Given his previous experience and the current price of the enhancement stones, he would need at least 500,000 gold to enhance one piece of equipment to +8.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Dammit, why does the price of the enhancement stones keep climbing? In the old days, the price of the enhancement stones were 100 gold and the blessed enhancement stones were 1,200 gold.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was because the overall level of the users had risen.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The higher the level, the longer it took to get out of that level section. Therefore, users felt the need to enhance their current items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As demand grew, the price of the enhancement stones also grew.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was no reason for the price of the enhancement stones to go down, unless the S.A. Group significantly increased the drop rate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, the S.A. Group wasn’t able to raise the drop rate of the enhancement stones.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In order to maintain game service for a long time, the minimum requirement was to avoid gold inflation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, Grid couldn’t think of such complex things. He just lamented and sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid suddenly became confused.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because the 30 blacksmiths admiring Grid’s Boots were now depressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What’s wrong?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid questioned and the blacksmiths started explaining.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Lauel commanded us to produce boots and gauntlets to supply the soldiers. We’re working hard on the boots and gauntlets, but...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“After seeing Duke Grid’s work, the boots and gauntlets that we produced are too insignificant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We know that it isn’t possible to make items at the same level as Duke Grid, but can you teach us so that we can at least mimic it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan had already passed on the boots production method to them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, they were hoping for Grid to teach them instead of Khan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I feel sorry...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid watched Khan. But Khan just smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I don’t mind. Their desire to learn from you is very natural.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A legendary blacksmith was on a different dimension from an advanced blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan knew this better than anyone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid saw his heart and nodded. Then he started smelting four pieces of iron ore in front of the 30 blacksmiths.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It is very simple to make boots. Watch and learn.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I can receive the teachings of the great Duke Grid!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 30 blacksmiths’ eyes shone as they watched Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid made the boots while adding brief explanations, then...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The experience of the Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath Skill Lv. 4 has increased by 9%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The experience of (Witness of God’s Weapon) Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill Lv. 5 has increased by 19%.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[When legendary rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +10.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Reputation throughout the continent will rise by +500.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid made legendary rated level 80 steel boots, shortening the time to the ‘special event.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wah! Really amazing boots!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You can easily produce such a great piece!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Indeed, Duke Grid is a legend!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Damn...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid shed tears.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If Grid’s Boots were made with the legendary rating, he wouldn’t have felt so bad.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now one more legendary item remained until the special event happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hah...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid could only sigh as he left the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t let go of his unhappiness at completing boots for a soldier with a legendary rating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sigh...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Trudge trudge.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">He had no strength in his steps.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid staggered like a man who had lost his country.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The people who saw him started to worry.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Duke Grid is always proud and dignified, yet now he is having a hard time...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Surely a crisis isn’t approaching Reidan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Maybe it’s a large monster invasion...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Originally, it was a law that bad rumors spread faster.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The security rating that was maintained at a stable figure thanks to Jude and the soldier’s efforts dropped dramatically.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jude and the Overgeared members were confused when they found out that the cause was Grid, but Grid didn’t even know about it.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Reidan Castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘According to Piaro, Asmophel’s escorts are very strong...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was unable to abandon enhancing the boots and searched the guild’s warehouse.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He hoped to find enhancement stones inside.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the guild’s warehouse only had a few minerals and sylphid scales that were supplied by Jishuka in Bairan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"In the end, I’ll have to buy them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid checked his inventory. He currently had 20,000 gold. It was the money he acquired from disposing of the loot dropped by monsters that he hunted on the way here.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What about the 5.5 million gold acquired from the golem invasion?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Five million gold was used as the guild’s funds, while the remaining 500,000 was converted to Korean money.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid currently didn’t have enough money.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“With this much money, I can only enhance it to +5 if I’m lucky.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">More money was needed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid went to his private warehouse.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there wasn’t a single item in his warehouse that was worth money.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A few months ago, he disposed of most of his items to acquire the money for his land and building in reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shit...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was a duke!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why did he have to be the owner of a big city?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was grumbling that Reidan was a poor city when he suddenly found an item in a corner of the warehouse.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a glass bottle the size of his little finger. There was golden liquid in the glass bottle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Maybe this will make me some money?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Goddess' Essence]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 0.1</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an item he acquired from the Pope Drevigo raid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, even the Legendary Blacksmith’s Appraisal skill didn’t have an explanation, so he didn’t know where to use it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The pope wouldn’t drop a cheap item...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pope Drevigo was the one who dropped the Holy Light Battle Gear, which was the strongest armor set.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid thought that the Goddess' Essence dropped by Drevigo was bound to have considerable value.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was just a vague expectation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was difficult to gauge the value because he didn’t know where to use it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What should I do? Ah!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a mysterious item that couldn’t be determined with the eyes of a blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then a well-informed person was needed to figure out the identity.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And he had such a person nearby.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was Rabbit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He has handled many goods, so won’t he be able to recognize the value of this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Please let it be a valuable item, as he expected.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid eagerly looked for Rabbit.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit’s office had documents stacked up like a mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I don’t know.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rabbit observed the Goddess' Essence a few times before giving up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid panicked at the unexpected result.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“There’s something you can’t grasp with your insight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I know that is is liquid that contains the divine power of Goddess Rebecca. But it is hard to tell what the effect will be.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It can’t be sold?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Be cautious.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">The always calm Rabbit raised his voice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"This liquid contains the divine power of Goddess Rebecca. You will regret it someday if you decide to sell it. You should treasure it for now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I need a quick source of money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I need enhancement stones.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Enhancement stones...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit unfolded a gigantic map of the western part of the kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style="">During the past four months, the Overgeared members had adventured and completed this map.</span></p>
