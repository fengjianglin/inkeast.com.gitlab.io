 <p><span style="">Chapter 371</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Hell Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a conditional activation skill attached to Iyarugt, and the power was great.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was comparable to the legendary skill, Pagma’s Swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he analyzed it in detail, it overwhelmed the power of Kill Lv. 4.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Hell Sword]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Inflicts 2,400% physical attack power to the target.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Every time the target is hit, an addition 100% damage will be dealt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Mana Consumption: 1,000</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 15 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chiiiiing!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Iyarugt was combined with Failure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pachik!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pachichik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Black sparks rose around Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A crescent shaped line was drawn.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a bisection.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Sakak-!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tiramet was slashed from the crown of the head to the crotch.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A total of 24 black rays gathered around him, making him unable to scream.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid moved and controlled everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘One.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Two.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Three.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">He manipulated the direction by moving his fingers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Of the 24 rays, only three managed to hit Tiramet. The remaining 21 ceased to exist after the one second time limit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s too hard.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He couldn’t adapt to the continuous command input. It was complicated and the time was too short. It wasn’t something he could adapt to after one or two times.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If I knew, I would’ve gone to the game room more often when I was young...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He wasted his time sitting at a desk and studying.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the corner of Grid’s field of view, the notification windows were being updated sequentially.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 1,229,112 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Health has been absorbed due to the option effect of Iyarugt’s Ring.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 17,071 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 17,071 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 51,213 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The duration of Blacksmith's Rage is over.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After Hell Sword, he followed it with the combo of Transcended Link, Linked Kill, Link, Kill, Pinnacle, and Revolve.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He even used Item Combination and Blackening.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At this point, Grid was betting on Tiramet’s end.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He shouldn’t still be alive.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He used all his strength against Tiramet from the beginning.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He only had 33 mana left after using his strongest skills in succession.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What if Tiramet survived?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid would be forced on the defensive until the mana potions and skills cooldown ended.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But that wouldn’t happen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Hell Gao with one fire stone obtained wouldn’t be able to withstand this combo…’ </span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s expression stiffened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why isn’t he dead?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He didn’t receive any messages about Tiramet’s death, or the experience and items obtained.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid stayed alert.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Ahh, yes, yes. This is why Elfin Stone suffered.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tiramet opened his mouth while his heath gauge was completely exhausted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s because his body is weak, unlike me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was baffled about why this guy didn’t die.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Tiramet’s body was torn like a rag, but magic power rose around him like a rag.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Among my siblings, I am weak in magic. Unlike my other siblings, I can’t use magic effectively. But instead...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because the black magic power around Tiramet completely restored his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I have the ability to focus my magic power on regeneration. It’s the perfect immortality."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tiramet laughed, revealing pointed teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Now, let’s start again.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Cheok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Tiramet took a fighting stance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was like a skillful martial artist. Yes, it was a form that was reminiscent of Regas.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It reflected the will to not be caught by surprise anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"For reference, I become stronger every time I half die and revive.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Tiramet moved one foot and swung his fist, causing magic power and wind pressure to explode at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a combination of magic damage and physical damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is a viscount?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Apart from the tremendous attack power, his speed was also faster.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid called the God Hands and took an active defense. It would be enough until the mana potions and skills cooldown ended.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Tiramet’s stats were significantly higher than before. It was difficult for Grid, who couldn’t use a single skill.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjeejeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">As the number of Tiramet’s kicks and punches increased, the intervals at which the God Hands stiffened became shorter.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid realized that the God Hands would soon be neutralized.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is bad for me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the case of Elfin Stone who used Blood Field, he was skilled in CC and magic, but his physical ability itself wasn’t special.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone was unable to exert a great deal of force against Grid, who could neutralize CC and a few spells. Tiramet was the opposite case.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a difficult opponent for Grid to take advantage of, since he depended on physical skills.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘In the first place, his revival ability is ridiculous.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was foolish to use the strongest skill combo to end it quickly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he hadn’t grown, he would’ve fallen into disarray and chaos.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">As Grid looked worse, Tiramet’s momentum rose. The speed at which he wielded his fists and feet gradually rose.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid tried to block but there was no escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I’m not a viscount because I’m weaker than Elfin Stone. I just don’t want to be annoyed by the responsibilities.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Taack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid started relying on the Divine Shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tiramet used the shield as a springboard and spun like a drill as he fell. The magic power concentrated on his toes caused a tornado, causing the area to be affected by the aftermath of the intense aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s no use.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid judged and took evasive action, but it was impossible to escape from Tiramet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because the duration of Quick Movements was over.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hahahahat! Yes, you humans are best suited to being on the ground!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tiramet’s feet crushed Grid’s shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid let out a terrible scream.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Tiramet grabbed Grid’s head and whispered in a grim voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will break you from now on.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Tiremet’s knee struck Grid’s face.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The second blow.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Three blows in a row.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura screamed as blood scattered from Grid’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">[Mana has been consumed to refine the ‘Extinction Bullet’.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your magic gun doesn’t support rifle mode. There is a very high probability of a misfire.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Extinction Bullet has failed to launch properly.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The durability of the Emilfa Magic Gun has fallen by 95. It might be destroyed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Mana has been consumed to use the ‘Vindictive Sword’.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your magic gun doesn’t support bayonet mode. There is a very high probability that Vindictive Sword won’t manifest.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Vindictive Sword has failed to be activated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The durability of the Emilfa Magic Sword has fallen to 0 and it has been destroyed!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Destroyed items can’t be recovered!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Demon Slayer Yura was still unable to exert her full strength.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was it because she failed to complete her class quest?&nbsp;</span><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was it because her stats hadn’t gone through the third awakening?&nbsp;</span><span style="">That was also right.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But the most important reason was that her magic weapon was only level 180.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A magic engineering gun.&nbsp;</span><span style="">For convenience, the magic gun was a weapon that could only be produced at an alchemist’s facility.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In fact, magic guns produced by the alchemy facilities were merely unfinished products.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Human alchemists only grasped the approximately working principles of a magic gun, but they didn’t yet understand the exact structure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The true magic guns that supported pistol mode, rifle mode, and bayonet mode could only be made by dwarves.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, Yura was blocked from proceeding with her class quest and was unable to enter the dwarf city of Talima.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The only man who stirred her heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura felt grief about not being able to do anything, despite him being trampled on.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura’s chest ached.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why are you doing this for me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why did he have to sacrifice himself?&nbsp;</span><span style="">She felt sorry for Grid and hated her own helplessness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have to save him somehow.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She tried to use her strongest skills, only for her weapon to be destroyed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura urgently armed herself with her secondary weapon, the level 120 Rianfa Magic Gun, and rushed to Tiramet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She felt gratitude and guilt to Grid, as well as her own pride.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The combination of emotions linked together to make her behave that way.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You have forgotten your opponent...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Stop!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura shouted at Tiramet and pointed the muzzle, only to stop.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because she heard Grid’s voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Relax. I’m okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The voice was too good for a dying person caught by Tiramet. His voice came from a strange location.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Tiramet jumped with surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"A fake?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Grid beaten up by Tiramet was Randy, not the real body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid fell from above Tiramet’s head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the moment when Randy’s new skill, after achieving level 200 in the Behen Archipelago, ‘Change position with the copied target’ was used to great effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“These people swapped...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuaaaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tiramet cried out with pain after Iyarugt’s head was pierced.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, it was too much to say that Grid would win.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was still lacking mana and the cooldown of other skills hadn’t come back in full.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Furthermore.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'What if I pour everything into it and he doesn’t die?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the worst. Then it would really be over.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There is the possibility that the boss can’t be defeated until certain conditions are met.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid suggested to Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let’s run away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Yura’s opinion was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She felt relief when she realized that Grid was safe, and regained her cool head. She figured out a way to kill Tiramet with her brains.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There is a wound where he was hit by a former Demon Slayer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why didn’t the wound heal despite her overwhelming regenerative power?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The answer was likely to be in the class called Demon Slayer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Maybe I’m the only one who can kill him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a rational judgment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Someone clapped at her judgment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Sticks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was watching the battle from outside the area and he grinned at Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It’s the correct conclusion."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the first time that Yura had seen an elf.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was confused for a while and realized.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid, did you manage to come here with his help?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right. The hidden sage, Sticks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sticks handed a small box to Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This is the gun that Alex used in his youth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Alex.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A former Demon Slayer and a man who was a close friend of Sticks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid, who was barely maintaining his composure, snapped out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You don’t have any items that Pagma used in his youth?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No, I wasn’t close to Pagma.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sticks replied firmly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid thought it was unfair.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian, who had been staying in Reidan for a month.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was having a lot of fun.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was he watching the construction process of the temple?&nbsp;</span><span style="">That was secondary.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lord Steim.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a lot of fun to play with Grid’s son.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You already understand the principles to manifesting divine power. Lord isn’t just a genius, but a super genius.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Bubu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lord nodded proudly as a warm ray of light poured out from his fingertips.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a feeble light, but considering that he had only be training for a month, Lord really was a genius.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He understood whatever was taught, so Damian felt a sense of fulfillment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You can use divine power to protect your friends and easily deal with demonkin. For example, the vampires.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian was intent on teaching Lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kasim and the Silver Dragons assassins hiding in the darkness were guarding Lord’s back.</span></p>
