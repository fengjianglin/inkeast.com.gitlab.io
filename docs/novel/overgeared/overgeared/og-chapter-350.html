 <p><span>"Pounding Mortar!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The moment that Piaro took out his peak technique.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kurururu!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>A tremendous sound was heard from the ground.&nbsp;</span><span>Thunder?&nbsp;</span><span>No. It was a more threatening and artificial feeling.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kuooooh!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The larger the shadow cast became, the heavier the atmosphere.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Jjirak.</span></em> <em><span>Jjirak.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Kraugel’s body was filled with an instinctive fear.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Unbelievable.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Kraugel stood on turbulent ground.&nbsp;</span><span>He looked up at the sky and faced a disaster.&nbsp;</span><span>It was as big as a house.&nbsp;</span><span>It was falling down at a fast speed.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kuwaaaaaah!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Kraugel couldn’t even scream.&nbsp;</span><span>The enormous mortar caused infinite suffering and fear as the mind and body crumbled.&nbsp;</span><span>It was a pressure that could kill someone.</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>[You have been hit by a lethal blow!]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The durability of the Plain Straw Hat (Normal) has been completely lost and is permanently destroyed.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The durability of the White Clouds Clothing (Unique) has decreased by 128.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The durability of the White Clouds Footwear (Unique) has decreased by 150.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The durability of the White Clouds Gloves (Unique) has decreased by 163. There is a risk of damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The durability of the White Fang (Legendary) has decreased by 61.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[You won’t die in sparring mode. Your health has fallen to a minimum, so sparring mode is finished!]</span></p>
 <p><span>The mortar that was the size of a house.&nbsp;</span><span>It disappeared like a ‘mirage’ after it crushed Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span>There were no more clouds in the sky. This was the aftermath of being torn by the force of Pounding Mortar.&nbsp;</span><span>Kraugel was at a loss for words and belatedly realized.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I lost.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Did he lose because Piaro was over level 400?&nbsp;</span><span>It was nonsense.&nbsp;</span><span>A level difference in the game was due to the difference in skills.&nbsp;</span><span>It meant his growth process lagged behind.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I completely lost.’</span></p>
 <p><span>What if they fought again?</span></p>
 <p><span>‘It will still be the same.’</span></p>
 <p><span>The current Piaro was different from the past.&nbsp;</span><span>He was a legend who completely overcame his immaturity after just becoming a farmer and relied on swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘He is a wall that can’t be overcome.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Did Kraugel’s heart sink down after realizing this?&nbsp;</span><span>No.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘...I can’t overcome him yet.’</span></p>
 <p><span>People praised Kraugel as a genius. He overcame trials and adversity, believing in this talent alone.&nbsp;</span><span>Of course, that was a big mistake.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘One day, I will go beyond him.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Were there any geniuses who had it easy?&nbsp;</span><span>Unlike what other people thought, Kraugel was accustomed to defeat and failure. He always faced challenges, because he was always challenging difficult situations.&nbsp;</span><span>But he didn’t give up. By working hard and overcoming the trials, he trained and raised himself. He would continue doing so in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Kuk... Kukukuk.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The straw hat’s destruction exposed the black-haired man with a wounded face.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Kraugel]</span></p>
 <p><span>The world’s most prominent name burst out laughing as he laid on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Kuhahahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span>It was a cool laughing sound that made the listeners happy.&nbsp;</span><span>He was delighted by the spar that allowed him to realize his own shortcomings.</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>Ruby and Lord were present at the outskirts of the training grounds where Piaro and Kraugel were sparring.&nbsp;</span><span>Nevertheless, what was the reason why Piaro was able to use his peak technique? &nbsp;</span><span>It was because he trusted Asmophel.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kuuuuuuong!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The moment the large mortar slammed against Kraugel and the training ground.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hup!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Asmophel protected Ruby and Lord.&nbsp;</span><span>He held the two people in their arms to protect them from the earthquake, creating a barrier from the sand storm. There was a wave of energy.</span></p>
 <p><span>“T-Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Abuuuu!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Ruby expressed her gratitude while Lord cried out loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span>"This world might perish, but I will protect both of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Asmophel asserted.&nbsp;</span><span>His loyalty moved Ruby’s heart.&nbsp;</span><span>On the other hand, Lord showed no interest in Asmophel.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Abu! Abuuuu!”</span></p>
 <p><span>How could a baby be so strong?&nbsp;</span><span>After forcefully pushing Ruby away, Lord fell to the ground and started to move towards the center of the training ground.&nbsp;</span><span>The crawling speed made it hard to believe he was a newborn baby.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Pant... Pant... Umm?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Piaro was tired from the aftermath of using Pounding Mortar.&nbsp;</span><span>He was thrilled when he found the approaching Lord.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Young Lord...! Do you recognize my skills?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Piaro had a discerning eye. He had glimpsed Lord’s genius early on. He wanted to propose a lifetime of doing field work together, so he coveted Lord’s talent.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘As expected of the young lord.’</span></p>
 <p><span>He understood Piaro’s strength through this duel. He wanted Piaro to serve as a mentor and they would work together in the fields!&nbsp;</span><span>The young Lord would be his best disciple.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘No, I’m still not good enough!’</span></p>
 <p><span>The moment that Piaro was full of expectations.&nbsp;</span><span>The crawling Lord reached Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span>Then he just passed by Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span>"...”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Hwiing~</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The wind blew.&nbsp;</span><span>Piaro was ashamed.</span></p>
 <p><span>'This baby...?’</span></p>
 <p><span>The depressed ground that was hit by the mortar.&nbsp;</span><span>Kraugel found the baby crawling towards him and was disconcerted.&nbsp;</span><span>It was so unrealistic that he couldn’t say anything to Lord.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Abu! Abuuuu! Bubu!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Kraugel couldn’t understand the language of a newborn baby.&nbsp;</span><span>But he dimly understood the meaning. The blue eyes staring at him. There was clearly envy in the eyes that shone as bright as jewels.</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>[Thunder Bow]</span></p>
 <p><span>Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span>Durability: 366/490</span></p>
 <p><span>Attack Power: 370~601</span></p>
 <p><span>* Arrows can’t be loaded.</span></p>
 <p><span>* 100 mana will be consumed per attack.</span></p>
 <p><span>* The skill ‘Penetrating Flash’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span>* 10% increase in firing speed.</span></p>
 <p><span>A heirloom of the Bon family in the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span>A bow made from a mixture of magic stones and ure stones, it consumed the user’s mana every time the bowstring is pulled to create a light arrow.</span></p>
 <p><span>If a common arrow is loaded, it won’t be able to withstand the lightning and will become ashes.</span></p>
 <p><span>User Restriction: Level 300 or higher. More than 2,000 agility. Advanced Bow Mastery level 5 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span>This was the bow dropped by the best archer in the Eternal Kingdom, Ferrell.&nbsp;</span><span>It was something that many archers would covet.&nbsp;</span><span>However, Grid didn’t appreciate the Thunder Bow’s performance.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘How many archers will have such high mana?’</span></p>
 <p><span>Consuming 100 mana just to shoot one arrow?&nbsp;</span><span>Even Jishuka, an expert archer, wouldn’t be able to fire more than 40 rounds. Its endurance was poor.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘The attack power is twice as high as similar bows.’</span></p>
 <p><span>In the first place, the attack power of the bow itself wasn’t important.</span></p>
 <p><span>'The attack power of the arrow is more important.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Yet arrows couldn’t be loaded? Could this really be called a bow?</span></p>
 <p><span>“Trash.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid came to this conclusion and dismantled the Thunder Bow. He didn’t hesitate at all.&nbsp;</span><span>The reason why Grid coveted this bow from the beginning was the ‘ure stone.’</span></p>
 <p><span>“Then I’m starting.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid approached the blast furnace.&nbsp;</span><span>The four God Hands kept the furnace temperature high. Their ability to control the bellows was at the level of advanced blacksmiths.</span></p>
 <p><span>"This should be enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid confirmed the temperature and threw the disassembled Thunder Bow into it.&nbsp;</span><span>It was to dissolve the rush, debris and other foreign matter through smelting in order to extract pure ure stones.</span></p>
 <p><span>After a while.</span></p>
 <p><span>[You have succeeded in refining the mineral!]</span></p>
 <p>[3&nbsp;<span id="footnote-3">pieces of ure stone has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Ttiring~</span></em></p>
 <p><span>[Ure Stone]</span></p>
 <p><span>A mineral that is produced only when the great demon Astaroth is present in the human world.</span></p>
 <p><span>The lightning attribute could be given to an item and it is also good to feed to demonic beasts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>The demonic beast will be very pleased when fed.</span></p>
 <p><span>Weight: 5</span></p>
 <p><span>“The concept of the mineral is similar to the fire stones that show up when Hell Gao appears... Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid was immersed in reading the item explanation and suddenly made an absurd expression.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Feed it to a demonic beast?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Was he crazy?</span></p>
 <p><span>"What type of crazy person would feed these precious minerals to a demonic beast?”</span></p>
 <p><span>It was a really useless function.&nbsp;</span><span>He had no intention of feeding this to Noe.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid put the three ure stones in his inventory.&nbsp;</span><span>He was planning to use it as a mineral when creating new items.</span></p>
 <p><span>At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kuuong!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The large smithy that contained 100 blacksmiths shook greatly.&nbsp;</span><span>Everything on display on one side of the smith fell to the ground, and the flames in dozens of furnaces shot upwards.&nbsp;</span><span>The minerals were burned and lost their value.</span></p>
 <p><span>“E-Earthquake?”</span></p>
 <p><span>"What are you doing? Go and grab the minerals!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The smithy instantly became a mess.&nbsp;</span><span>An earthquake in the middle of a desert city?&nbsp;</span><span>The blacksmiths were unfamiliar with natural disasters but they showed professionalism, gathering the minerals and turning off the fire.</span></p>
 <p><span>On the other hand, Grid was angry.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘It isn’t an earthquake.’</span></p>
 <p><span>His high insight let him know.&nbsp;</span><span>The previous shook was due to the aftermath of battle.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Khan, please deal with the situation here.”</span></p>
 <p><span>It was good to have someone to trust.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid entrusted the smithy to Khan and left.</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>Kraugel recovered his stamina to a certain extent.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Brother, you truly are great. I was able to learn many things. I’m not lying when I say that I admire you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span>Piaro always wanted to be the strongest.&nbsp;</span><span>It was the destiny of the strongest to be connected with strong people.&nbsp;</span><span>But there was something that couldn’t be helped.&nbsp;</span><span>Kraugel’s talents were beyond prediction, so Piaro had to be prepared.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Really? Someday you will surpass me.”</span></p>
 <p><span>He had learned this from the young Lord.&nbsp;</span><span>The young Lord had gone to Kruagel.&nbsp;</span><span>The young Lord felt that today’s winner was Piaro, but it would be different in the future.&nbsp;</span><span>Kraugel asked the jealous Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span>“By the way, what is with this child?”</span></p>
 <p><span>At first glance, this baby wasn’t ordinary.&nbsp;</span><span>It wasn’t Piaro who answered the puzzled Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span>“My son.”</span></p>
 <p><span>A heavy voice resonated through the training ground.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I greet My Lord!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Piaro, the absolutely strongest man who could look down at the whole world, and the best knight Asmophel, bowed down.&nbsp;</span><span>It was shocking for Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Step, step.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>"Abu! Abuuuu!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Lord smiled brightly.&nbsp;</span><span>The owner of the voice, Grid, smiled at Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What is the 1st ranked user doing in my land?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid was showing obvious hostility.&nbsp;</span><span>It was natural.&nbsp;</span><span>He didn’t feel good because he witnessed a person he didn’t know laughing with his family and friends. Wasn’t he also the culprit because the destruction of the training ground?</span></p>
 <p><span>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span>Kraugel couldn’t open his mouth.&nbsp;</span><span>Piaro spoke on his behalf.</span></p>
 <p><span>"My Lord, this person is called Kraugel. He is a brother that I have a close friendship with.”</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Brother...’</span></p>
 <p><span>Kraugel’s heart warmed. He was touched that Piaro tried to defend him.&nbsp;</span><span>But this impression didn’t last long.&nbsp;</span><span>Piaro wasn’t ‘defending’ but ‘reporting.’&nbsp;</span><span>Brothers?&nbsp;</span><span>That was important, but his loyalty came first.</span></p>
 <p><span>"After not meeting for a long time, he applied for a spar and I accepted, resulting in the training ground being like this. I will dispose of him according to My Lord’s decision.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"...”</span></p>
