 <p><span style="">Chapter 370</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone, master of the 13th city, was an earl, while the master of cities in the 10s were viscounts.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura was well aware of the strength of a viscount type vampire.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘At least five of the elites of Overgeared must be present to raid them.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It might be possible if she completed all her class quests and went over level 300, but she couldn’t do it alone right now.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura judged this and focused on survival.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She fought defensively in order to buy as much time as possible for her scattered colleagues to return.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Tiramet’s combat power was too destructive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was stronger than the other viscounts she had met.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'He met a former Demon Slayer and survived.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was clearly a unique event, meaning...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Named boss!’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura avoided the bleeding magic, but her range of actions was constrained.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Soon after, she was faced with a kick flying at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can’t avoid it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She would lose at least a third of her health.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The key was to not allow any linked attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura calculated the angle and deliberately moved her body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moment she was hit, she would be blown back to the rear pillar and planned to use that gap to regain her posture.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Syuk~</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A shining golden shield came flying and protected Yura from Tiramet’s kick.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura’s normally always calm eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She knew who the owner of this golden shield was.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why was he here when he should be in the Behen Archipelago?&nbsp;</span><span style="">How did he enter, and why did he only show up in important moments to help her?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will keep depending on you if this happens.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Even Yura’s sad expression was beautiful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The True Blood vampires were divided into two types.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were the nine children born directly by Shizo Beriache, and those made using their blood.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Viscount Tiramet was a direct descendant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was at least three times stronger than the usual made vampire viscounts, so it was right to call him a quasi-earl.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was being threatened by a human?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It didn’t make sense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unless his opponent had the title of a legend!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Linked Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuaaaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tiramet’s body was pierced five times by a blue-black energy blade, causing him to scream terribly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The black haired human who suddenly appeared, his attack power was devastating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The angry Tiramet waved his hand, causing his magic power to move.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the manifestation of transfusion magic that hit all targets and took away their health.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A non-targeted skill.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The black haired man, Grid’s, eyes changed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He withdrew the greatsword that was inserted into Tiramet’s chest, while using the footwork of Link to avoid the blood magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a remarkable accomplishment, considering the timing and speed of the magic. Of course, the aid of the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch was also great.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You rat bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tiramet shouted as his health went down and he punched out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid’s skill deployment was quicker, since he was already completing the footsteps of Link.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Link.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A little while ago, Grid had stabbed Tiramet’s chest rather than his head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The head would receive more damage, but he wasn’t able to hit the enemy’s head with 100% accuracy with his current skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, Link was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The range of the slashes was much wider than a stabbing attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This will hurt.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pit!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pipipipipit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the same time as Grid’s proclamation, Tiramet’s face was mangled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Tiramet was shaken by the terrible pain and pulled out a trump card.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Blood Tornado!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Magic power moved around Tiramet like a whirlwind.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s body was swept into the air by it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’ll kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Five blood missiles flew towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“God Hands!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Syuok!</span></i> <i><span style="">Syuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Two golden hands came flying at Grid’s call. They spread open their palms and blocked the Blood Missile, but stiffened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The three remaining Blood Missiles hit Grid’s head and chest.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was an explosion and Grid coughed up blood.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Tiramet confirmed it and laughed with excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuhahat! You’re quite strong, but you’re still human! There’s a large physical difference between you and I! A human body is like dry leaves, while the body of a True Blood vampire is like steel!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was true, but Tiramet was also hurt by his wounds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The damage from the human destroyed common sense and half his health was consumed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'But!'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had vampire magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Tiramet smiled and aimed magic at both Grid and Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"My body is a stone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tiramet’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The human received three Blood Missiles and was far from death!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why is a human so durable...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Magic Missile."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jiing.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Magic Missile (Enhanced) Lv. 2.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The legendary spell, which had become more powerful in the Behen Archipelago, accurately penetrated Tiramet’s heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Tiramet thought it was ludicrous.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I was hit by a Magic Missile?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why was a magician so tough?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, why did he use a sword so well if he was a magician?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Tiramet was feeling astonished when Grid appeared above him, drinking a health potion.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The blue-black greatsword struck like a lightning bolt!&nbsp;</span><span style="">The momentum was great, but it was easily caught by Tiramet’s left hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This body won’t be caught by the same pattern!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tirament stretched out his right hand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He grabbed Grid’s neck and pushed him into a pillar.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Blood Burn!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s body was pushed into the pillar and swept away by the explosion of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura’s face paled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No matter how good his items, stats, and class, she was worried that Grid wouldn’t be safe from this attack.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She had forgotten for a moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was someone who fought against Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Already making me use Doran’s ring.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s appearance was moderately fine.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But his expression wasn’t good.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I still have a long way to go.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel wouldn’t have been caught by the neck when the attack was blocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'He would’ve aimed for the head with the first Linked Kill.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was Grid frustrated after knowing he was lacking so much, despite going to the Behen Archipelago?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Just like Kraugel and Yura, Grid was now aiming to be the best.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t be so easily frustrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let’s start properly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This guy keeps on speaking nonsense... Hah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tiramet, who was laughing with a relaxed expression, hurriedly moved from his position. Two golden hands appeared in the air.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The hands could fly on their own through the air with weapons?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Artifacts that can be used for both offense and defense, and move by themselves...! It is big!’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Chaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The God Hands’ Sword Mastery level had grown from the beginner to intermediate level.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the result of Grid repeatedly using them in the Behen Archipelago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They wielded the Ideal Dagger, the Doppelganger’s Greatsword, and fired Magic Missiles to tie up Tiramet’s feet for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But it wasn’t enough to drive Tiramet to the defensive.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What can you do with such shameful artifacts?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Tiramet grasped the trajectory of the two God Hands, avoided them and reached for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Die!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">He fired Blood Fire, which dealt both fire damage proportional to his health.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid faced the heat and revealed his power for the first time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Blackening.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your black magic power has increased.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You don’t have any black magic power. It will be replaced with demonic power.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[While Blackening is activated, your species will change to half-demon.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[As a half demon, your maximum health is reduced by 50%. Your attack power, magic power, and agility will increase by 20% each.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[All attacks will be converted to the black magic attribute.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Quick Movements.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The skill attached to the Ideal Dagger equipped to the God Hand has now been activated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your evasion rate is increased by 30% and your agility is doubled for 1 minute.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Blacksmith's Rage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Attack power will increase by 25% and attack speed will increase by 40% for 35 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The items have successfully combined!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The combination time of Failure and Iyarugt will last 2 minutes.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reason that Grid only used two God Hands during the battle wasn’t to make fun of Tiramet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He recognized and appreciated Tiramet’s strength, so he had used the Item Combination skill with two God Hands just before entering battle.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Clink!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The two God Hands flew here and gave Grid a new weapon. Based on his increased agility, Grid evaded the Blood Fire and gave orders to each God Hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Open. Magic Missile."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Syu syu syu syu syuk!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The hands scattered all over the place fired a Magic Missile at Tiramet, making it difficult for Tiramet to avoid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This technique... Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tiramet cried out as he deployed Blood Shields to defend against the Magic Missiles.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The black haired man, who was hard to define as a human anymore, was coming closer?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Fling Blood!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Continuous Stab!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i> <i><span style="">Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Tiramet wasn’t ordinary.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Using the Fling Blood skill, he was able to boost his stats and defend against three of Grid’s five attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid judged that he was unable to achieve five combos in this situation and used Blood Cry.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kakiing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk... No, that’s Elfin Stone’s!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tiramet’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid saw an opportunity and chopped at Tiramet’s shoulder with Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Pinnacle.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From here, Iyarugt’s power activated properly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The 3rd combo has been achieved!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The damage done to the target will increase by 200% for 1 second.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Urgh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tiramet’s face wrinkled as he was affected. Yet he tried to fight back, proving his strength. It wasn’t comparable to Elfin Stone, but Tiramet far exceeded the weakened Hell Gao.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was expecting Tiramet’s counterattack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Revolve.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The counterattack came on cue.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the moment when Grid’s aim was completed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The 5th combo has been achieved!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The target’s sense of reason has collapsed for 0.3 seconds.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The skill ‘Hell Sword’ can be linked.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The skill must be activated within 0.3 seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now Grid could strike at the right timing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hell Sword.”</span></p>
