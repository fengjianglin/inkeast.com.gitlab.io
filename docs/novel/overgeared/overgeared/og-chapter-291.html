 <p><span>Chapter 291</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <hr>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>[A junior vampire was vanquished.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[4,901,000 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[4,855,000 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[An intermediate vampire was destroyed.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[6,954,300 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[6,899,000 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>The amount of experience from the vampires was more than expected.&nbsp;</span><span>It was nearly three times as much as the desert monsters.&nbsp;</span><span>This was a considerable number considering that the Overgeared members also got some experience for reducing the vampire’s health.</span></p>
 <p><span>This was also due of the experience buff potion.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Reputation is worthwhile!’</span></p>
 <p><span>It was the moment when wasting 25,000 paid off.&nbsp;</span><span>However, he had no intention of challenging it again.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I might draw a red pepper again.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid vowed again.&nbsp;</span><span>The battle wasn’t very good.&nbsp;</span><span>It was due to the resistance of the surviving vampires.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Blood Transfusion!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Dark Missile!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The vampires determined they couldn’t beat Grid in a melee, so they opened the distance and used magic.&nbsp;</span><span>Due to that, Grid’s body became injured.&nbsp;</span><span>There was a chance to completely resist black magic with the Holy Light Armor or counter the vampires’ evasion with Lifael’s Creation.</span></p>
 <p><span>If it hadn’t been for these two things, Grid might’ve become a cold carcass by now.&nbsp;</span><span>The vampires were strong. It varied from individual to individual, but they were several times stronger than the Black Knights.&nbsp;</span><span>In particular, the vampire’s bloodsucking skill. They kept recovering their health. The answer was to smash them in one blow.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Link!”</span></p>
 <p><span>For fusion skills like Linked Kill and Transcended Link, the higher the level, the greater the features. For example, Transcended Link received a penetration effect when it reached level 3.&nbsp;</span><span>On the other hand, basic skills like Kill, Link, and Wave only increased the damage whenever their skill levels went up.</span></p>
 <p><span>For example, while Link had a skill level of 5, it was weak in comparison to the power of the fusion skills.&nbsp;</span><span>If the vampires were in a perfect state, they would’ve survived Link; however, they were now severely injured and were thus swiftly torn apart by Grid’s sword.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Flash!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Once 50 out of 200 vampires had died, a pillar of light fell onto Grid’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p>[10&nbsp;<span id="footnote-10">stat points have been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid had already been on the verge of leveling up when he entered the building, and now he reached level 297.&nbsp;</span><span>There were only three levels remaining before he reached level 300.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Distribute my stat points.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid distributed the 10 points he gained into agility as usual.&nbsp;</span><span>His stats distribution method was based on the great swordsman Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span>Strength 1: Agility 1: Stamina 0.7.</span></p>
 <p><span>Piaro was aiming to be a sword saint, so there was no way his stats would be a mess.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid speculated that Piaro’s stats ratio was likely to be the perfect golden ratio.&nbsp;</span><span>And his guess was right.&nbsp;</span><span>As Grid’s agility neared his strength, the power of his swordsmanship gradually increased.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Seokeok!</span></em> <em><span>Puk!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>“Kuaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span>His attacks became faster and more powerful than before, as he stabbed and slashed at the vampires.&nbsp;</span><span>The vampires were dying at a faster speed.</span></p>
 <p><span>[The Finest Tailcoat have been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Junior Vampire’s Ring has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Finest Tailcoat]</span></p>
 <p><span>Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span>Durability: 120/120 &nbsp; &nbsp; Defense: 301</span></p>
 <p><span>Charm +50</span></p>
 <p><span>An essential item for stylish vampires.</span></p>
 <p><span>This tailcoat is wonderful enough to capture everyone’s attention. It also has excellent defense and can be used for protection.</span></p>
 <p><span>User Restriction: Level 300 or higher. A man.</span></p>
 <p><span>Weight: 120</span></p>
 <p><span>[Junior Vampire’s Ring]</span></p>
 <p><span>Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span>* During normal attacks, 5% of the damage done to the target will be restored to you as health.</span></p>
 <p><span>* This effect is only invoked once every 15 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span>A unique magic power dwells in the vampire’s ring.</span></p>
 <p><span>It is a ring used by junior vampires so the rating is low, but it is very helpful for the wearer’s survival.</span></p>
 <p><span>User Restriction: Level 280 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span>Weight: 1</span></p>
 <p><span>The item drop rate of vampires was very low.&nbsp;</span><span>If he killed 30~40 vampires, only one of them would drop an item, so it was the worst drop rate.&nbsp;</span><span>However, the value of the items dropped was very good.</span></p>
 <p><span>'Vampire accessories!’</span></p>
 <p><span>Vampire items dramatically increased combat endurance and survival.&nbsp;</span><span>They were very rare, meaning this was the first time Grid saw one since the launch of Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Let’s try out the effect.’</span></p>
 <p><span>[The Junior Vampire’s Ring has been worn.]</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Puk!</span></em> <em><span>Puk puk!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>“Kuaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“I...! To a human...!”</span></p>
 <p><span>After being pierced by Lifael’s Spear, the vampires were hit by Failure and the Doppelganger’s Greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span>The wounds Grid received from them slowly recovered.&nbsp;</span><span>This was the greatness of the Holy Light Armour combined with the vampire’s ring.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span>[You have dealt 9,300 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[5% of the damage has been absorbed due to the option effect of the Junior Vampire’s</span></p>
 <p><span>[The option effect of the Holy Light Armor has increased the power of recovery magic by 300%.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[1,350 health has been restored.]</span></p>
 <p><span>The effect was only triggered once every 15 seconds, but this was enough for Grid.&nbsp;</span><span>Sometimes, the 5 Joint Attacks skill of the Holy Light Gloves was triggered, causing his health gauge to climb noticeably.&nbsp;</span><span>Thanks to his items and skills, Grid’s base damage was uniquely high.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Kukukuk! Kuhahahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hiik!”</span></p>
 <p><span>"V-Vampire slaughterer!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid burst out laughing while wearing the Slaughterer’s eye patch and mask, filling the vampires with terror.&nbsp;</span><span>The situation had completely changed.&nbsp;</span><span>The vampires on the first-floor were all killed by Grid, giving him experience and new items.</span></p>
 <p><span>Before he knew it, Grid’s experience gauge exceeded 20%.&nbsp;</span><span>But he couldn’t be pleased.&nbsp;</span><span>He was worried about Elfin Stone appearing, and the vampires on the upper levels also started to gather.&nbsp;</span><span>The upper floor vampires had a much higher level than the first-floor vampires.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Stop!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The Overgeared members stood on the stairs and intercepted the vampires’ path.&nbsp;</span><span>Rather than acting straight away, they made a defensive formation.&nbsp;</span><span>It was to give Grid time to recover his health, mana, and stamina.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid felt thankful and rested straight away.</span></p>
 <p><span>Meanwhile, Vantner once again tasted hell.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Ugh! I need to endure this again!”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Peok!</span></em> <em><span>Peok peok!</span></em></p>
 <p><em><span>Kwajak!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Vantner cursed Malacus’ Cloak. No, he lamented that he chose a tanker. It didn’t fit his aptitude. He mistakenly raised this character, but he wanted to delete it and make a new character.&nbsp;</span><span>As he was complaining, the Overgeared members lowered the vampires’ health.&nbsp;</span><span>Then Grid finished them off at the proper timing.</span></p>
 <p><span>It took half a day to finish attacking one whole building, and Grid’s experience gauge was up to 60%.&nbsp;</span><span>This was a ridiculous growth rate considering it took the Overgeared members an average of two weeks to go from 297 to 298.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Wow, it is faster than expected."</span></p>
 <p><span>“It is natural. There are seven users in the top 20, as well as Huroi.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"That’s true. Anyway, if we clear four more buildings in the future, you will reach level 299.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"The problem begins at level 299. The amount of experience needed to level up is four times as much as level 298.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"Considering it takes half a day to clear one building... You can achieve level 300 in five days?”</span></p>
 <p><span>"Assuming that Elfin Stone doesn’t appear.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span>The key was who Elfin Stone would use his skill on after reappearing.&nbsp;</span><span>Vantner and Huroi had a one-time invincible skill that could invalidate damage, but the others were different.</span></p>
 <p><span>“If one person dies, the balance of the party is disrupted, drastically slowing down the speed of the hunt.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Well... It depends on luck. But why hasn’t he appeared yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span>It has been half a day since Elfin Stone first emerged.&nbsp;</span><span>It was a long time considering he said he would be back.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Well, it is good if he is late.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The Overgeared members moved to the next building.&nbsp;</span><span>In this building, a few True Blood vampires emerged.</span></p>
 <p><span>[True Blood Vampire: Boras]</span></p>
 <p><span>[True Blood Vampire: Rujul]</span></p>
 <p><span>As named monsters, they were very strong.&nbsp;</span><span>They were far superior to the 19th Knight, Fulito, and also had dozens of subordinates.&nbsp;</span><span>Vantner felt a crisis.&nbsp;</span><span>He inevitably had to use his invincible skill, Guardian's Power.&nbsp;</span><span>It had a cooldown time of 48 hours, so one of the precautionary measures against Elfin Stone fell.</span></p>
 <p><span>The party’s morale fell.&nbsp;</span><span>Huroi tried to encourage them.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Don't worry. The next time Elfin Stone appears, I’ll try to provoke him.”</span></p>
 <p><span>It was impossible.&nbsp;</span><span>Elfin Stone appeared and used the skill instantly. It wasn’t a skill that someone could deliberately draw towards them.&nbsp;</span><span>But Huroi believed in his speaking ability.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Words are faster than action. I will try to attract his aggro before he uses the skill.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span>Sooner or later, Elfin Stone’s parents would be mentioned.&nbsp;</span><span>The Overgeared members were now familiar with Huroi. They were grateful that Huroi wasn’t their enemy. They shook just imagining what he would say.</span></p>
 <p><span>[The True Blood vampire, Boras has been destroyed.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[44,690,500 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[A complete ruby has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The True Blood vampire, Rujul has been destroyed.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[45,900,000 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The Third Piece of ??? has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Complete Ruby]</span></p>
 <p><span>A gem that can be used as a material for top-rated accessories.</span></p>
 <p><span>Weight: 2</span></p>
 <p><span>[Third Piece of ???]</span></p>
 <p><span>It can’t be determined what this is a piece of yet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>A minimum of three pieces must be collected before it can be determined.</span></p>
 <p><span>Weight: 15</span></p>
 <p><span>The second building was completed.&nbsp;</span><span>With the help of his colleagues, Grid was about to kill 150 vampires and two True Blood vampires to reach level 298.&nbsp;</span><span>However, there was a feeling of disappointment.</span></p>
 <p><span>'True Blood vampires have a chance of dropping elixirs.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Drinking an elixir could permanently increase stats!&nbsp;</span><span>If not, how good would it be if an intermediate or advanced vampire accessory dropped?&nbsp;</span><span>It was clear that the Blood-sucking Third Piece of ??? was a unique item, but he didn’t know if it was more or less valuable than elixirs and vampire accessories.</span></p>
 <p><span>Then a notification window flashed in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span>[The cooldown time of the title skill ‘One who Became a Legend is over.]</span></p>
 <p><span>His invincible passive skill was restored.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Now I can fight with more ease.’</span></p>
 <p><span>He felt anxious when he didn’t have this immortality.&nbsp;</span><span>Just as Grid was sighing with relief...</span></p>
 <p><span>"Didn’t I say I would come back?”</span></p>
 <p><span>An eerie voice was heard from above Grid’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span>[The master of the 13th city, Vampire Earl Elfin Stone has appeared.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[A strong evil influence is making your magic power turbid. All types of spells and skills aren’t available.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[A vampire’s gaze will subdue lower species. Your body is subjected to a strong oppression.]</span></p>
 <p><span>"Elfin Stone!”</span></p>
 <p><span>He was finally here.&nbsp;</span><span>Huroi hurriedly opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span>"You...”</span></p>
 <p><span>However, this time actions were faster than words.&nbsp;</span><span>Huroi only managed to speak one word before Grid was swallowed up by a curtain of blood.&nbsp;</span><span>Elfin Stone smiled coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I will come back soon. I will kill another person, and then another one the time after that! This will be repeated again and again. I will show you the extreme taste of fear!”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Suruk!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>All traces of Elfin Stone disappeared.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid trembled once he got out of the curtain.</span></p>
 <p><span>“That crazy bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Why did he keep attacking Grid?&nbsp;</span><span>Grid was grateful, but he felt very dirty.</span></p>
