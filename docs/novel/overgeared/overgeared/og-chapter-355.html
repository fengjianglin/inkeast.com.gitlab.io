 <p><span style="">Chapter 355</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">After a few minutes of silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner stared at the spot where Kraugel logged out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“We should stay here until Kraugel logs in again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is that a good idea? Once he logs in, we will immediately kidnap him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay! We’ll make him a slave of Overgeared!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh! The 1st ranked user will join Overgeared!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The members of Overgeared made a plan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid frowned at them and said,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Cut it out. Don’t force it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka was surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You want to miss out on the chance to get the best power?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was the embodiment of greed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Considering Grid’s usual tendencies, he should be obsessed with obtaining Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She couldn’t help feeling curious.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Does he personally not like Kraugel?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid spoke to the questioning Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We can’t get colleagues by force, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Of course, there were those who were baited by Overgeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">For example, Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Lauel and Kraugel were different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel was a person who became fascinated with the power of items when he was looking for power, while Kraugel was a person who disliked belonging to a group.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If they forced him to join, would he really be born again as a true companion?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“And I already have the best colleagues. All of you. So don’t cling to Kraugel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t a pretense at all.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid believed that he could accomplish any goal with his current colleagues. He didn’t feel great regret towards Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had a separate role that he wanted for Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Kraugel.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Go your own way. Be sure to become a sword saint.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then on the day they met again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Make me grow stronger.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had learned a lot in the spar with Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">How to avoid non-targeted skills, how to deal with targeted skills, how to use mana and physical strength, how to use items and skills, how to use the terrain and so on.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Every one of Kraugel’s judgments and movements were deeply engraved in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Of course, I can’t be like Kraugel right away.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid believed it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he keep trying and trying, one day he would be able to fight a better match against Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was conscious of Kraugel as his rival.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A stupid person having a rivalry with the best genius?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Some people might laugh.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid didn’t doubt his eligibility.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because he had a high pride as the unique being who broke the sky above the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a pride unmatched by the arrogance that had been used to cover up his deficiency.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka returned to the castle with Grid and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why didn’t you call us when Prince Ren’s army tried to invade Reidan? Do you know how absurd it was when I had to hear from the news that our territory was invaded by the enemy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You were working hard hunting the vampires, so I didn’t want to disturb you. In the first place, it was possible to resolve it with Lauel alone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You should call us if there is an incident! What if you were in danger?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the past, Grid would’ve responded casually, saying ‘If I was, I would summon a knight.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now Grid was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He realized why Jishuka was angry and apologized.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m sorry the actions that I chose made you dissatisfied."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t because he thought they were useless, or because he didn’t think of them as colleagues. It was pure goodwill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid apologized with gentle eyes and Jishuka couldn’t say anything more.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is becoming harder to deal with him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka couldn’t help being conscious of Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had a weak and stupid side, so sometimes he felt young.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That wasn’t the case anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Since becoming a father, Grid had been changing rapidly. He felt a strong sense of responsibility and his deficiencies were being erased one by one.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka liked this appearance even more.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He will be great by the time he reaches 30 years old.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She wanted to see the mature Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As Jishuka felt mesmerized, Lauel approached Grid. Then he randomly apologized.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is it all of a sudden?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Actually...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel honestly confessed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“When I saw you on the battlefield a while ago, I thought you were still lacking. But this time, I realized that my eyes were wrong. You won against Kraugel, the sky above the sky. In the future, I won’t doubt your skills again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After the 1st National Competition, Lauel had been with Grid for more than 10 months in real time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">So far, Lauel had never looked at Grid with ‘envy’ or ‘respect.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now it was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The emotions in Lauel’s eyes deepened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I, Lauel, will stop following you just for your items. In the future, I will serve you will an honest and pure mind. This is the true oath of my soul that will penetrate the past and present.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid and the Overgeared members got goosebumps at Lauel’s words.&nbsp;</span>Their hands and feet shrunk and they couldn’t think of anything else.&nbsp;<span style="">Huroi was the only one thrilled by Lauel’s oath.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Going back in time, to when Grid had just completed the Elfin Stone raid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 A non-NPC player was elected as the pope! In addition! A Japanese person! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Japan was overturned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style="">An exceptional person who rose to the 2nd ranked paladin, despite being a paladin of the Rebecca Church.&nbsp;</span><span style="">One day, he suddenly disappeared from the rankings list, so there was a rumor that he’d obtained a hidden class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And he was an otaku.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One of Japan’s best Satisfy players was elected as pope of the Rebecca Church.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Japanese were filled with joy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They weren’t able to win a medal at the 1st Satisfy National Competition, but Japan cheered at the birth of a savior.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Damian! Congratulations on being elected pope! The Japanese people are very proud! 』&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Thank you. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 How hard was it for you to become a pope? The whole nation wants to know. What how did you overcome the trials and adversities to achieve something so great? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The power of the pope of the Rebecca Church was absolute. Even the kings of a few kingdoms had to bow to the pope.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was why the Japanese had high hopes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian would develop a lot of policies favouring the Japanese users, making a great contribution to Satisfy’s development in Japan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This changed once Damian started the interviews with various media outlets.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 I only became the pope thanks to Grid. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The legendary blacksmith Grid? There was a big battle with Grid and the Red Knight on the day of the pope candidate speeches. Was this how he helped Damian? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 It isn’t just that. From beginning to end, I could only become pope thanks to Grid’s help. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s popularity was steadily rising.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In particular, since the release of the white-haired version of Grid, a large fandom had formed in Japan. It was enough to make him the protagonist of the 5th Korean wave.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But as always, the Korean wave was a story that applied only to a small number of people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Most of the Japanese people didn’t care about the Korean wave.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In such a situation, the Japanese hero Damian praised Grid exclusively, causing resentment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was one of the main people who frustrated Japan in the National Competition, causing a backlash among the extreme right-wing people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why is Damian attributing all his achievements towards Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Doesn’t he know how much Japan suffered because of Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid is our nemesis! Not only did he destroy the Japanese rankers in the National Competition, he was also involved when the Sakura Guild attacked the Silver Knights Guild in the past!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? Grid is completely the worst! Damian, why is he praising that bastard? Is he a Zainichi (A Japanese word referring to Koreans who live in Japan)?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s possible! It makes no sense that a pure blood Japanese would be a traitor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Japanese felt public outrage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Damian is a Zainichi’ appeared on various SNS. A rumor that he ‘wanted to improve the image of Korea in Japan’ started to spread. It was the dirty masterpiece of the Japanese extreme right-wing forces.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Damian didn’t care.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had always been mocked for being an otaku, so such accusations were familiar to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Rumors are raging about whether Damian is Korean or not. What do you think about this? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 I am a pure blood Japanese. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 However, Damian tends to portray Korea in a good manner by mentioning Grid in all interviews. There are many people who are questioning your intentions. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 I have never portrayed Korea in a good manner. I just thanked Grid, and it was misinterpreted by some people. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 In any case, it’s true that Damian’s image isn’t good for our country. In order to change your image and remove suspicions, why don’t you build a Rebecca Temple in the territories ruled by the Japanese? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Strict conditions must be met in order to build a Rebecca Temple in certain areas. A temple can’t be built just because we belong to the same country. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Then... Damian, do you have no intention of helping Japan after becoming pope? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Of course. What does being pope have to do with Japan? As a pope, I must always be neutral. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 ...I see. Then can I ask about your first official plan of action as pope? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 It is to build a temple of Goddess Rebecca in Reidan. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 No, didn’t you say that strict conditions had to be met to build a temple? Reidan’s current population is only 20,000, so doesn’t it fail to meet the conditions? You said you are neutral, but aren’t you blatantly favoring Grid? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Fuji TV.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was one of Japanese’s leading right-wing media outlet, with the announcer representing the extreme right-wing people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He conducted an interview with a very negative view on Damian’s behavior.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If Damian was a common person, he would’ve been afraid of the influence and retaliation of the extreme right wing forces.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Damian was an otaku.&nbsp;</span><span style="">An otaku’s firm belief wasn’t easy to bend.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 I’m not showing favoritism to Grid, but repaying his grace. Grid is the person who saved me and the Rebecca Church! Goddess Rebecca has given me a divine message to repay his grace! Praise God Grid!! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 ... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Crazy bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Japanese extreme right wing forces were furious.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Japanese had gained great power, but that person wouldn’t help his own people, or convince the Koreans to help him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They started thinking up a terrible plan.</span></p>
