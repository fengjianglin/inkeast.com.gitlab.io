 <p><span style="">Chapter 321</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“I greet My Lord!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The vacant lot in front of Khan’s smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro came at the promised time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s expression wasn’t good.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because Piaro was the same as yesterday.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was wearing old clothes covered in soil and holding a rusty hand plow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The outright image of a farmer. In addition, a poor farmer!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Not dressing formally as the captain of the Overgeared Knights Division and commander of Reidan. Can’t this be interpreted as disloyalty towards me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid came out strongly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It seemed he still hadn’t accepted Piaro as a farmer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro stood his ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I dress appropriately when carrying out my duties as commander and captain of knights division. Right now, I am a farmer, so I look like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This damn farmer’s life, I’ll settle this today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You don’t have to. Isn’t this the increase in power that My Lord wanted? As a farmer, I am capable of exercising power beyond what was possible before. Now I am much stronger than when I was a great swordsman. Please respect the path I chose and acknowledge this fact.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s weaker than a sword saint! Get rid of that farmer and become a sword saint!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t speak for long. He pulled out two weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The +9 Failure has been equipped.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The +8 Grid’s Greatsword has been equipped.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The plain Grid’s Greatsword from yesterday was now shining with the color of a +8 enhancement.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a result of investing all the enhancement stones that Grid had gathered. It was unfortunate that it didn’t reach +9.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Today I am different from yesterday!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Confidence filled Grid’s eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro couldn’t understand it at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why does he believe this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Didn’t he see the difference between them yesterday?&nbsp;</span><span style="">His skills couldn’t have gone up in a single day, so what was the basis for his confidence?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He is the master of 20,000 people and a legend.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a bigger problem if he was arrogant. This could easily create enemies and cause danger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro had a different set of values from Braham.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Out of loyalty to Grid, he made a decision to break Grid down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will show you my power today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As soon as Piaro armed himself with a hand plow and hoe, Grid attacked as if he had been waiting.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He advanced and utilized the long reach of Failure.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">He blocked with the hand plow, and used the repulsive force to retreat back.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The air around Grid started to boil.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His black hair and the stones on the ground started rising.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Transcend.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Entering the transcendent mode.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Attack power is doubled. Your basic attacks will be converted to ranged attacks.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[This effect will last for 30 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“If you don’t want to die, avoid this.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid continuously wielded his two greatswords. He swung them without a break. Every time he did, powerful energy blades poured out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Hah.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro admired it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s momentum rose and Transcend had a powerful force.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Certainly, he is different from yesterday.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yesterday, Grid relied on pure swordsmanship and suffered. Today, Grid used Pagma’s Swordsmanship from the beginning.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a very wise decision. The legendary skills were the only means of narrowing the gap between Piaro and himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro was impressed with Grid’s wisdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘But...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The difference in basic abilities was too great. Wisdom alone couldn’t overcome the fundamental issue.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro confronted the heavy bombardment with his hand plow and hoe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was an explosion whenever the farming equipment collided with an energy blade, and the energy blade would disappear. Piaro wasn’t hurt by Grid’s skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But to a third party, Piaro seemed to be in a great crisis.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro was in the center of a series of explosions and seemed like he would be injured.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is impossible...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Wow, that is complete damage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris and the Five Captains were astonished as they watched the battle from a distance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s use of Transcend was great. It looked impressive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid seemed like he was completely overwhelming PIaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid can easily fight an opponent we couldn’t…?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid is strong!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They thought they had become stronger than him after reaching the third advancement, but this was a mistake.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Compared to Grid’s legendary class, they were still lacking.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As they grew, Grid was also growing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris and the Five Captains’ pride was crushed at this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Sowing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro spoke from the centre of the explosion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris and the Five Captains were delighted as they confirmed that Piaro was fine.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Indeed! Piaro would never be defeated by Grid!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid, it looked amazing, but there was no substance behind it!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They weren’t any worse than Grid after reaching the third advancement.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As Chris and the Five Captains were feeling happy, seeds shot like bullets towards Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The female of the Five Captains, Pinky, was certain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is the end for Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s seeds weren’t something that could be blocked or avoided. They were fast and powerful, unconditionally dealing blows to the target.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">A few days ago, Pinky had been hit by the rice seeds and feel into a critical state.&nbsp;</span><span style="">How could Grid handle this technique?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pinky was certain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But she too arrogant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pinky made this conclusion on the assumption that she was superior to Grid. But the reality was that Grid was much better than her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Freely Move.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the skill attached to the title ‘Secret Hero.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were limits to the range of use, and the cooldown time was one hour. However, it was a top dashing skill that allowed him to avoid all non-targeting skills until he reached his target.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s Sowing was quick and exquisite, but they couldn’t reach Grid unless it was a targeted skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s eyes widened with surprise.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid showed a surprising swiftness as he approached through the rice seeds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Aren’t I different from yesterday?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid whispered to the surprised Piaro and attacked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">With the help of Freely Move, he arrived in front of Piaro and used Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Pinnacle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is impossible!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Five Captains were shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro had a big wound on his shoulder and was bleeding. They couldn’t believe it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The opponent that even Chris couldn’t harm...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He received a fatal wound!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris reminded the dumbfounded Five Captains.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No, Piaro is fine. This is the limit for Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was true.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s posture didn’t collapse despite the wound on his shoulder. Grid struck properly, but the level difference made it possible to avoid a fatal blow.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro ignored the greatsword stuck in his shoulder and struck forward with his hoe.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will be hit!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid read it with the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch and his insight, and tried to defend. He wanted to block the hoe by moving Grid’s Greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Piaro’s attack contained an anomaly. It seemed to rush in front, but it actually moved to the side, making Grid’s defense useless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 11,900 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is crazy!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid paled as his side was struck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was wearing the most powerful armor set in existence, but he received so much damage from a rare rated farming equipment?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The hand plow flew towards his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is the end!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This time, Asellas was sure of it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A few days ago, he had been defeated by Piaro’s blow to his forehead with a hand plow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, this was also a mistake.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had something that Asellas didn’t.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the power of items.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro cried out with alarm. He was greatly astonished.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was natural.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A shield suddenly appeared in front of Grid and blocked the hand plow. The hand holding the shield didn’t belong to Grid...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A hand that’s moving alone!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This hand even held an item!&nbsp;</span><span style="">He could imagine all the ways that it could be used.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid laughed at the shaken Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let me show you the power of items.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid declared and threw Failure and Grid’s Greatsword into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Forsaking a weapon during battle?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris and the Five Captains couldn’t grasp the exact situation because they were watching from afar.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“E-Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Something ridiculous happened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Two more gold hands appeared and grabbed the greatswords thrown by Grid?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Take a good look!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris hurriedly spoke.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This might be the only opportunity to get a glimpse of Grid’s power. He couldn’t miss anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris and the Five Captains flinched with surprise while they were concentrating.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was due to the appearance of a handsome man with blonde hair to his waist.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His name was Asmophel, and he wore white armor and a blue cloak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An NPC.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris’s response was angry because he was interrupted in an important moment by a NPC.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Asmophel responded with a nonchalant expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"A captain of the Overgeared Knights Division.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Overgeared Knights Division?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pfff!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The name of the knights division was funny.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris and the Five Captains reflexively laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Asmophel didn’t like this reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Now you’re sneering at My Lord’s knights.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Suuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Asmophel pulled out a sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a one-handed sword that seemed to be a compact version of Dainsleif.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Who dares draw a sword in front of us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Everyone is looking down on us! Don’t make fun of us just because we’re covered in dirt!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Five Captains were furious and armed themselves, and they had to pay a harsh price.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Red Sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Keok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It happened in an instant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was a red storm of light and all of the Five Captains, except for Zirkan, were bleeding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There wasn’t only one monster...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zirkan barely defended against the attack, but it was pure luck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Zirkan’s eyes shook as he realized the difference with Asmophel from just one skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Asmophel saw him and sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Many of my skills are dead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was once the only rival of a great swordsman, so it was shameful that he couldn’t get rid of this weak person with one blow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris shouted as Asmophel was about to attack again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Look!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris was clever and had experience with Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was well aware of how to act foolish.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We have a mission from Piaro to work in the rice fields! Then we’re going!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was more valuable than their lives?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris and the Five Captains ran away from Amosphel. Asmophel didn’t bother chasing after them. The important thing right now was the confrontation between his lord and his friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Asmophel knew Piaro’s strength better than anyone else.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, he couldn’t believe the sight that was unfolding before his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The four golden hands that were holding three greatswords and one dagger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Blackening.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His lord was surrounded by black magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro started to be pushed back.</span></p>
