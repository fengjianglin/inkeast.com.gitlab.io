 <p><span style="">Chapter 379</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">[You are attempting to grant a new option to Iyarugt.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Congratulations! A new option has successfully been granted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was excited by the notification window.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It succeeded at once!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had bad luck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He hardly ever won in an odds game until now.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If there was a lottery with a 99% chance of winning, he would be the 1% who didn’t win.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now he won in a game where the odds of winning was only 21%.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was deeply thrilled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it only lasted for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The B grade option ‘Coolness’ has been given to Iyarugt.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Iyarugt has become even cooler.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttiring~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[+8 Iyarugt]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Unique (Growth)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 351/351 &nbsp;Attack Power: 793+365</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The ‘Coolness’ option has been added with alchemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"?????"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What? Coolness? The coolness level rose?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No, what is this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Among the many options, it happened to be coolness?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He thought things were going too well.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He never dreamt that it would be such a useless option.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I can’t believe this... Things never work out well at once...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was feeling frustrated when Silverun cheered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh...! Ohhh! The best of the B grade options, ‘Coolness’ was given! It’s beyond expectations!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Coolness was the best option in the B grade?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid doubted his ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is the best option for the B grade? Then how bad are the other options?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The science of alchemy, the more he knew, the worst he thought it was.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The money he invested was being ruined.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rabbit gave positive feedback while Grid was squeezing his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Coolness is an important factor. Whether it is people or object, a good appearance is an easy way to build up favor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the same in reality.&nbsp;</span><span style="">People were constantly trying to be cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">They paid attention to their hair style and attire, and could spend hundreds of millions of won on luxury goods and plastic surgery.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reason was simple.&nbsp;</span><span style="">To increase the value.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In fact, when a person judged an object, appearance was an important concept that they looked at first.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">When Grid thought about it, he heard rumors that the hidden class Skin Maker, the user was making a killing when it came to money.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It only changed the appearance of an item, not the performance, but there were many people who paid big money to look more beautiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid observed Iyarugt and had a positive opinion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A gentle radiance was flowing from the long, red blade.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Certainly, it looked much cooler than before.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Buuong.</span></i> <i><span style="">Buoong.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Every time he wielded it, Iyarugt shone like jewels.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid looked cooler when he wielded it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was obvious that people’s attention would be concentrated on him in the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But once again, Grid wasn’t satisfied.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">"Until the alchemy facility reaches the advanced level, we will continue to accumulate fairy dust without using it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style=""> “...Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid replied in a listless voice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was disappointed by the option given to Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rabbit bowed with an awkward expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Then I will be going back to work.”</span></p>
 <p><span style=""> “Yes... Work hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid separated from Rabbit and returned to the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wanted to make weapons to utilize Spear Shot and Bow Mastery prior to departing for the Behen Archipelago.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s enough to make the same bow that I made for Jishuka.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He would made a spear that was specifically for throwing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid devised a plan.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">"Create hand plow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The hand plow has been developed.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Paaaat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Over 50 hand plows rose simultaneously at the newly opened fields near the Altes Mountains.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t a typical hand plow, but a hand plow developed with aura.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pa pa pa pa pak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The 50 aura hand plows started digging at the ground at once.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an overwhelming sight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was as efficient as 100 farmers doing field work at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the majesty of Aura Master Hurent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was embarrassed worldwide after being defeated by Gird in PvP in just 5 seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had a strong desire for revenge against Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘In the next 40 days.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 2nd National Competition would be held in 40 days.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As a representative of the United States, Hurent would participate in the National Competition, compete against Grid and win this time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there was a problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“My eyes are correct. Your skills are very suitable for field work. Do you want to work with me a little longer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Legendary farmer Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a wicked person who kidnapped Hurent, but Hurent knew how much the value of the hidden quest was worth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent felt his resentment towards Piaro melting away like snow, so he carefully asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“How much longer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Three months?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Three months...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was too long.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had many things to prepare for the National Competition, which would take place in 40 days..</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Can’t it be one month?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro shook his head at Hurent’s question.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“If you are only going to help for a month, it is best to just leave now. I am going to teach you a new skill, suitable for farming, and it can’t be learned in one month...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent stood at the crossroad of choice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Should he leave Piaro right away to dream of revenge on Grid, or get stronger by staying near Piaro and then get revenge on Grid?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“U-Ummm...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent tried to think objectively.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Could he win against Grid right now?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'To be honest, there’s no guarantee.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Three months ago in Satisfy time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was convinced that he was stronger than Grid when he invaded Reidan with Prince Ren, but not anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because of Piaro’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You are strong. But there are many people stronger than you. What? How do you compare to My Lord? Of course, My Lord is stronger than you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At first, Hurent thought that Piaro was biased.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, after experiencing Piaro’s personality, he knew that Piaro wasn’t someone who spoke empty words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If I can’t beat Grid now...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was likely to once again be embarrassed in front of the world.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If that was the case...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...I will help you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were many opportunities.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even if he didn’t participate in the National Competition this year, there was the one next year and the year after that.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Until then, Hurent wanted to grow as much as possible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was determined to evolve the Aura Master class to legendary.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Good choice."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro smiled at Hurent’s new commitment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Since this day, Reidan’s agriculture started to develop at a faster pace and Hurent gradually adapted to the life of a farmer. He tried so hard for Reidan that his revenge on Grid was in vain.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal of the Snake Guild, Chris of the Giant Guild, Seuron of the Golden Guild, Hao of the Hades Guild, Bondre of the Ice Flower Guild, Bubat of the Yak Guild, and Ralph of the Zeraph Guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The leaders of the seven guilds gathered in one place.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were the strongest players in the top 30 of the unified rankings and also participants of the 2nd National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It has been nine months since we united to invade Reidan and were disgraced.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After that, the seven guilds lost their honor and dignity.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The seven guilds were once an object of fear, and now they were made fun of. Only the Overgeared Guild was the best.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We must regain our honor in the National Competition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Seuron expressed doubts at Zibal’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You mean to smash the Overgeared Guild in the National Competition? How?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The National Competition wasn’t a guild war. It was a competition in which countries fought against each other.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The members of Overgeared were divided into several nationalities, so it would be very difficult to only be hostile to Overgeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal smiled in a meaningful manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid is the symbol of Overgeared. In addition, Grid is Korean. We must thoroughly shatter South Korea.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The power of a symbol was beyond imagination.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What if they completely trampled on the Korean team led by Grid?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It would prove that the seven guilds were still alive, while being able to crush Overgeared’s reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The Overgeared Guild is no longer the best.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal was certain because he had items made by Panmir, the 1st ranked blacksmith, in his inventory.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The items were produced with dwarf techniques, so they weren’t lacking compared to Grid’s items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let’s join forces to trample on South Korea and regain the honor of the seven guilds.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The difference between the best and the worst was huge.&nbsp;</span><span style="">When the seven guilds were called the best, the masters of these guilds earned a huge amount of money.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was natural to miss those days.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The silent Chris gazed at Zibal and opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Zibal, since when were you our representative?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Originally, the seven guilds weren’t one.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Like regular guilds, they kept each other in check. Sometimes they were hostile, sometimes they were allies as they all competed against each other.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At one point, Zibal established the alliance of seven guilds and took the lead.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris didn’t like this fact.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hey, Chris. What are you saying? Representative? I’m the representative? I never thought of myself like that. I see all of you as equal companions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The seven guild masters were all people full of pride.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris said something that would irritate them, so Zibal tried to laugh it off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wanted to make sure that the atmosphere of the alliance didn’t deteriorate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris scoffed,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Who’s your companion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris never participated in the alliance of the seven guilds. He didn’t participate in the Reidan invasion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reason he attended this meeting was to make it clear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The name ‘Seven Guilds Alliance,’ don’t use it in the future. My Giant Guild has never joined the alliance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris declared and rose from his seat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The other guild masters didn’t care about his actions. There was no reason to force him to join the alliance just because they were the seven guilds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Zibal thought differently.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He judged that it would be better to break Chris down, rather than leaving him as a variable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal stood in Chris’ way and smiled grimly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The rumor that you joined Grid is true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Chris and Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The impassive guild members started to react.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I'm with Grid? What are you talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"One of my men came across you in a hunting ground... The weapon you used at that time looks exactly like one of Grid’s weapons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The atmosphere of the room sunk.</span></p>
