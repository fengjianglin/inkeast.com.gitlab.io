 <p><span style="">Chapter 66</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">[Quest success!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Obtained the status of ‘Eighth Servant.’]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[ The skill ‘Infinite Faith’ will be created.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The skill ‘Teaching Doctrines’ will be created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The skill ‘Divine Punishment’ will be created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Having travelled all over the north of the Eternal Kingdom, Yura succeeded in rescuing 300 believers and eventually cleared the quest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a result, the Seven Servants changed into the Eight Servants, and the power of the Yatan Church became more powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura checked the details of the newly acquired skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Infinite Faith]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The growth rate of your faith will double.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Passive skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Teaching Doctrines]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lv. 1</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Preach the doctrines of the Yatan Church and cover a single target with the property of darkness. The dark property will prevent the use of divine spells for 4 seconds, and will deal 1.5 times the damage for 2 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Mana Consumption: 800</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 100 seconds&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Divine Punishment]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Summons a lightning bolt that deals 15,000~23,000 damage within 10 metres.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Range of Damage: 3m radius around the target.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* If you use this skill to kill an enemy, your faith will rise by 50 points for each killed enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Mana Consumption: 4,00</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 1,200 seconds&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The biggest drawback of a black magician was that they were far inferior in attack power compared to other magicians.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But after being reborn as the Eighth Servant, Yura overcame this disadvantage with the skills she acquired.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">For all users of Satisfy, the following notification windows rose simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Eighth Servant of God Yatan was born. The believers of Yatan who witnessed the power of God Yatan will have their faith deepened.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The influence of the Yatan Church will increase throughout the continent.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The minimum level for the Yatan believers has risen from 160 to 170.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Players who are part of the Yatan Church will benefit from a 20% increase in experience for the next 72 hours.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[If the Yatan Church continues growing like this, their forces will become strong enough to form one nation.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an emergency.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dozens of countries that existed in Satisfy declared that they would subjugate the Yatan Church.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because they couldn’t condone the strengthening of a religion that harmed others in the name of sacrifices to their god.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The users were bombarded with quests relating to the Yatan Church subjugation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was no different in the Eternal Kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, Earl Steim in the north declared a large-scale expedition.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This time, I will get rid of all the seeds of the Yatan Church in the north!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">All over the north, the Yatan subjugation quest was given.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The users cooperated and searched for the Yatan Temple.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Yatan Church also resisted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“This is an opportunity! Show the pagans the greatness of God Yatan! Dye the continent with the color of God Yatan!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The First Servant and bishop of the Yatan Church, the continent’s strongest black magician, Tallos!&nbsp;</span><span style="">After he declared war, the millions of users belonging to the Yatan Church received numerous war related quests.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Alliance VS the Yatan Church!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The large-scale episode that would have a great influence on the landscape of the continent had started.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Since it was the biggest event since Satisfy was first started, the attention of the whole world focused on it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『Will the alliance be able to stop the Yatan Church? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 If the Yatan Church wins and sets up a nation, I would be curious about what type of story would develop... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『The Yatan Church is evil! Evil! Users must cooperate and wipe them out!』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『As you know, the cause of these events is the Eighth Servant. There is a rumor going around that the Eighth Servant is a user, not an NPC. If the Eighth Servant is really a user, there is only one person who can be the candidate... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『5th place on the unified rankings! Blood Witch Yura! The world must pay attention to her! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The media treated this as a huge issue, even more than when the second class appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Any news related to the Yatan Church would catch the attention of all the media; however, Grid was in a different world.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I need to complete my class quest...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had produced various sets of armor for the past 10 days, resulting in him being fully equipped in rare and epic equipment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Uhh... Kesan Canyon is still difficult despite being armed to this degree...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kesan Canyon!&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was considered one of the worst areas in the north.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The terrain of the sinuous canyon was hard to move in, and the cliffs on both sides were so high that they gave the impression that the sky was covered, causing an ominous and fearful atmosphere.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The real problem was the hundreds and thousands of large and small caves that existed in the canyon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The monsters and mysterious creatures hidden in the caves were at least level 160, and they immediately popped out when they discovered a traveller. If he didn’t move carefully, he would be like a rat in a trap.&nbsp;</span><span style="">How risky was it to become one of the five forbidden areas in the Winston Kingdom?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had gone to Kesan Canyon to find a clue for Earl Ashur’s quest, and died more than 10 times.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I am different from before... My stats are superior to when I was a warrior, and I have great items. Don't lose courage so easily...kuock!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t dare enter Kesan Canyon, as he knew for sure that he would die within a few minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, he started blaming Khan’s ancestor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No, why would that insane ghost draw the picture in Kesan Canyon...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But his resentment didn’t matter.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He needed to enter Kesan Canyon to complete the class quest. Reality wouldn’t change, no matter who he blamed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"For the time being, should I stop making items and raise my level from hunting? If I increase my level to 150, I should be able to fight the monsters in Kesan Canyon... No, dammit. I can raise my level at any time! I need to pay off the debt. But if I don’t postpone the quest, I can obtain Dainsleif quicker. Kuoh! Isn’t there something good I can try</span><span style="">? Ah...!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid came up with an idea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Item creation!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation Skill]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You can create three equipment item production methods every time the skill level of the ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill’ goes up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Number of items that can be created at present: 5/6.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When items are produced using this skill, the name of the creator is automatically placed on the item.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the case of Failure, he couldn’t make it because he was lacking blue orichalcum.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had experience with Failure, so he was confident that he could create the right item this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, I will make an item! An item that will allow me to counter the monsters in Kesan Canyon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had died 10 times in Kesan Canyon, so he knew the general tendencies and attributes of the monsters in Kesan Canyon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay, let’s do it. Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An item with a whole new concept was about to be created by Grid.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">"There are 29 days left. I can’t wait until the reunion~”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That reminds me, how about Youngwoo? Will he come to the reunion this year? Has he changed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A group of people who had been friends for 10 years since high school, was travelling through the north of the Eternal Kingdom. They were Shin Youngwoo’s schoolmates.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were interested in the reunion that would take place soon, as well as Shin Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Are you curious? Do you really think he will come to the reunion? The others have studied abroad or found a job, while he is playing the game and riddled with debt. Won’t he be too embarrassed to come to the reunion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Indeed...he was ignored by everyone at the last reunion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ugh, if I were Youngwoo then I would’ve seriously thought about suicide. Of course, I don’t think that Youngwoo should kill himself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Once again, Shin Youngwoo was someone who didn’t have any remarkable parts in his school days. Both his grades and exercise ability were always in the middle, and he followed other people to an average university.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Until then, no one really laughed at him,</span></p>
 <p>But now it was different, as all the alumni ignored him and laughed at him.&nbsp;<span style="">Frankly speaking, the other alumni weren’t doing so well. There were those who graduated from university and landed a tough job at a company or those who were still studying.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They experienced the ruthlessness of society as they felt disappointed at not finding the right employment or studying environment. Yes, it was a time of tremendous anxiety.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In such a period, Shin Youngwoo was a good target.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'At least I’m still better than him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were comforted by that thought as they looked at Shin Youngwoo.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">A human who was worse off than them?&nbsp;</span><span style="">They ended up poking fun at Shin Youngwoo. At this point, they couldn’t be called ‘friends’ anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Speaking of which, it is amazing. Hasn’t Youngwoo been playing Satisfy since it first opened? We started late and only play after work or on weekends, but we are already over level 80. So what has he been doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I agree. If I only played Satisfy like Youngwoo, I would’ve already been a ranker. Pathetic, truly pathetic. Youngwoo doesn’t even have a talent for playing games.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As they laughed among each other, they realized that something was strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Where is this place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Well... this place isn’t on the map... what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They weren’t from the north, so they didn’t know how dangerous the north could be. There was no way to know when they might be chased by high level monsters, or if they would fall into a trap.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That’s right. Currently, these travellers had fallen for a trap designed by goblins, and lost their way.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pant pant...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How long did they walk?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No matter how long they walked, they couldn’t see the end of a vast snowfield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You feel hungry.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have started to feel dizzy.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your health is slowly falling.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a constantly flashing notification window warning them of danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What should we do...? We didn’t set a new resurrection place after we came to the north?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah... that’s right. It is a big deal. If we die here, won’t we be resurrected in Amsland? Does that mean that three days of travel will be gone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I’m more worried about my experience following, dammit! We’ll die from being frozen to death, not even hunting! What the hell is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were heading to Winston to receive the quests lining up for them, only to get lost in the far north.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As pain, despair and anger filled their faces, they suddenly brightened up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because they reached the end of the snowfield and found a canyon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let’s go there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They left the snowfield in a hurry. It was a huge canyon that boasted more scenic views than the Grand Canyon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow! Is this real? It’s the first time I’ve seen such cool scenery! I haven’t even seen it in movies!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is there any need to travel around the world these days? It is much better to travel on adventures around Satisfy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hey, do you think Youngwoo’s been a tourist during the one year he’s been playing Satisfy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Puhahaha! It is a possibility. An enjoyable trip travelling around Satisfy~! Wow, isn’t Youngwoo unexpectedly romantic?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The group forgot that they had just been on the verge of dying.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were too occupied with the canyon’s beautiful views!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“But where is this place? Is it here on the map?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No, this place? Ah, I see it. Ke...san. Is this Kesan Canyon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kesan? I think I’ve heard it before?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Isn’t this landscape rare in Satisfy? Maybe it’s a famous tourist attraction.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hrmm... but isn’t it too early to say that it’s a tourist spot?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh? Do you hear anything?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The expressions of the party members gradually stiffened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No matter how they looked, they were the only people in this wide canyon. They couldn’t even find animals.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was calm except for the sound of the wind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The party felt something ominous.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I can’t help feeling nervous. Let’s get out of here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Y-Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They hastened their pace. They didn’t look around at the scenery anymore, they just walked forward.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then they realized there were dozens or hundreds of large and small caves in the towering cliffs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What is this?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I don’t know...? Are there even any animals?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuweeeeeoh!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kiyahahahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kkiiik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Bizarre sounds were heard from the caves. They sounded like the cries of beasts, or the laughter of a person.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then a gigantic shadow appeared from a cave.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Suruk suruk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A shadow with eight legs descended along the curved walls.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The identity was a spider. It was an incredibly huge spider. It made a 15-ton truck seem small.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"H-Hik!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The party felt horrified by the giant spider and didn’t have the strength to stand up anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The giant spider shrieked and its body shook like it was funny, before shooting out spider webs.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The spider web was thicker than rope and stronger than wire. The party screamed as they were wrapped in the webs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, Grid was standing at the entrance of Kesan Canyon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid looked at the canyon and recalled past memories.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I came here only to die, die, and die...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was so terrible than Kesan Canyon kept appearing in his dreams.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was a place that caused Grid a lot of fear. He would only be able to sleep by defeating Kesan Canyon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The monsters here are so weird...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The monster of Kesan Canyon were incredibly grotesque. It was both their appearance and inclinations.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Among them, the ‘canyon spider’ was the one he remembered vividly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The giant spider eats people alive. Uhh...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The shock and horror of being trapped in a spider web and not able to move as the spider’s mouth neared him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I’m glad that I didn’t feel myself being chewed because I died the moment my head entered its mouth...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid recalled the memories of that time and cleared his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Stop wasting time on useless thoughts and find Pagma’s swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His deaths here were in the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Now I am different! I will show you the power of items, you monsters! Revenge! Revenge!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid cried out as he entered the canyon. But unlike his words, his body was trembling in fear.</span></p>
