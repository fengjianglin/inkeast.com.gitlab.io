 <p><span style="">Chapter 384</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">"Whistle!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A chilly autumn morning, in front of Grid’s house.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Before he knew it, Kang Cheolgyu had been waiting for 13 hours and his nose became runny.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He felt confused as his cold body shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The car isn’t leaving...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">For Kang Cheolgyu, a house was just a place to sleep.&nbsp;</span><span style="">To him, it was impossible for someone to stay in their house for more than 13 hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'What’s wrong with him?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A single storey house.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a very small house that was 25 pyeong, and this included the garden area.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kang Cheolgyu somehow felt sorry as he thought of the young man living alone there.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Poor fellow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kang Cheolgyu lost his parents early on.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He lived in poverty and had no place to lean on.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He remembered the days when he lived in a basement room off ramyun noodles and how cold it was.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now the current Grid seemed to overlap with his own past, causing Kang Cheolgyu’s heart to feel sorry.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...No, wait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Wasn’t Grid living with his family?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I’m not in a position to worry about him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kang Cheolgyu was suddenly filled with doubts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Even though he lives with his family, why hasn’t anyone left for 13 hours?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The lights in the house weren’t even turned on.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Perhaps...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Could it be a robbery?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kang Cheolgyu was worried.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Perhaps Grid and his family are being held hostage by robbers?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t possible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was his target. He needed to hurt Grid to be paid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shit, I guess I have to rescue them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kang Cheolgyu might have a good fighting ability, but his head was bad. It wasn’t just that he didn’t go to school and read, but that he was born with a terrible brain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He forgot the reason that he watched Grid’s house for 13 hours was because the house had a security sticker on it and started to climb the fence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reason for making such a stupid choice was nervousness.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chirpppppppp!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The sensor detected Kang Cheolgyu hanging from the fence and the alarm sounded. It was a loud noise that rang out through the neighborhood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kang Cheolgyu was startled and jumped from the fence.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He tried to escape when someone blocked his way.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"A rat came here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The man was wearing a eyepatch over his left eye.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a young Westerner with a big nose, light green eyes, and short grey hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kang Cheolgyu was alert as the Western spoke in a foreign language that couldn’t be understood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kyaaack~ spit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Westerner didn’t speak for long. He spat out phlegm and acted like he was going to make a move on Kang Cheolgyu.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kang Cheolgyu’s face distorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This crazy one-eyed bastard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They wanted to act against the chief of the Poisoned Wave gang?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I don’t know who you are, but you will regret this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kang Cheolgyu’s fists were fast and powerful.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was three consecutive blows and a jab, a perfect killing technique based on boxing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the Westerner was several times better.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Westerner blocked all of Kang Cheolgyu’s punches with just his right hand, then grabbed Kang Cheolgyu’s wrist. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kang Cheolgyu’s face paled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This guy!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He saw through the lightning fast punches and even neutralized it?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The movements were at the level of a world-class boxer!&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Westerner saw Kang Cheolgyu’s shaking eyes and raised a long leg.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pakak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kang Cheolgyu shook as he raised his left arm to guard against the Westerner’s attack. He tried to pull away the right wrist held by the Westerner, but the grip was too powerful.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Westerner pulled Kang Cheolgyu and raised his knee.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Heeok!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kang Cheolgyu’s nose was crushed by the hard knee.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Westerner still gripped his wrist as he tried to block the blood.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kang Cheolgyu determined he couldn’t break free with force, so he rotated and swung his elbow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Westerner had a sharp scar on his nose.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was like a knife cut.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Fairly good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Westerner was somewhat impressed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was only up to there.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kang Cheolgyu’s strength was broken after he suffered great damage to his face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the first place, the Westerner was more proficient, since Kang Cheolgyu suffered from a one-sided violence.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Bam bam!</span></i> <i><span style="">Bam bam bam!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The Westerner was really cruel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He kept punching, punching, and punching Kang Cheolgyu.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Blood flowed down from Kang Cheolgyu’s face, and he now seemed pitiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You... Who the hell are you...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why was this Westerner so strong, and why was he beating Kang Cheolgyu to death like this?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Westerner introduced himself to Kang Cheolgyu.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m Grid’s bodyguard, Toon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The identity of the Westerner was beast master Toon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He once broke the balance of the Italian mafia, and was the strongest player in reality.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reason he was staying in South Korea was at Yura’s request.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Toon-ssi, you are lacking funds to buy land in South Korea? If you want to move to South Korea like the other guild members, I will arrange a place for you to live. Instead, please be responsible for Grid-ssi’s safety.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s safety was the desire of all Overgeared members, not just Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Because there was Grid, the Overgeared Guild could exist. Because there was the Overgeared Guild, they could be in their current positions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In particular, Toon had a great tendency to rely on Overgeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The existence of colleagues who he could rely on was very important for an orphan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Touch, Grid, kill.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chill.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Toon’s eyes were as cold as a beast as he spoke in broken Korean.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kang Cheolgyu nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“U-Understood. I won’t step on Grid’s shadow in the future!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment he declared this.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Creak.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The door to Grid’s house opened and a young man appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had been lying in the capsule for 13 hours and ran over when he heard the alarm sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? What's going on? Eh? Toon? Why are you here? When did you come to Korea?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was an unidentified man and Toon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid couldn’t figure out why.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At this time, three security company cars arrived in front of Grid’s house.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You’re safe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The security company’s employees descended from the cars and checked Grid’s safety.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid wasn’t just a customer, they were also fans of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh... Well, I’m okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid replied while standing next to Toon, so that there wouldn’t be any misunderstandings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Meanwhile, the security company employees arrested Kang Cheolgyu and reported it to the police station. The officers were astonished when they saw Kang Cheolgyu’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">And at dawn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was an explosion of TV and Internet news.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Grid, he played a significant role in the arrest of a drug trafficker.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Kang Cheolgyu, the chief of the drug dealers in South Korea, was caught by Grid and his colleague Toon.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The city of Seoul is awarding an honorary citizen’s medal to Grid and Toon.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The National Police Agency will provide an appreciation plaque and prize money to Grid and Toon.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Blue House is thinking about a president’s citation.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Ah, I have to play the game.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t even know why he received the honorary citizen’s medal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an honor, but Grid’s expression showed that it was merely inconvenient.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t want to waste time travelling to Seoul City Hall and the police station with Toon, as well as have interviews with reporters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I don’t have time to play the game.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toon felt vaguely sorry towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have entered the 40th island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid educated Lord and made a spear and bow to be used.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was fully prepared and returned to the Behen Archipelago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sticks greeted him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You finally came.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will start the challenge immediately.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t ask if the other Overgeared members had reached the 20th island.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had faith that his colleagues would do well, and now he had to concentrate on his own development.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reason why Grid was so worried?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was simple.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The 2nd Satisfy National Competition was to be held in Paris, France.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had to play a big role there.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I must unconditionally win three gold medals.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was it because he coveted the god mineral adamantium?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Of course. But that was just secondary.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reason Grid wanted to act in the National Competition was because he was aware of his position as representative of the country.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had the hopes of 50 million people and his family on him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid didn’t want to disappoint them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now Grid felt a strong sense of responsibility.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a noble attitude that couldn’t be compared with his personal feelings during the 1st National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hoo.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid breathed in deeply as he stepped foot into the gate of the 41st island.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His vision darkened before a new landscape unfolded in front of him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a serene bamboo forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have entered the 41st island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A mission will be created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[41st Island]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Fight with yourself and win.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">First Clear Compensation: You can raise the level of one skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There aren’t any challenger points?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Grid wasn’t disappointed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had legendary skills that were hard to raise their levels, so he was quite pleased with a skills level up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This feels like a bonus stage.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The mission of the 41st island was to overcome his ‘past self’ and transcend his ‘present self.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">It felt like a test.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What was at the end of the Behen Archipelago, which forced the challenger to constantly grow?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid wondered while looking around nervously.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Sururuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A person who looked exactly like Grid appeared. There were four golden hands moving around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The God Hands are recreated?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It seemed like the copy of Grid reproduced all of Grid’s items and skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid became tense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the clone moved to Grid’s shock and horror.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Linked Kill Wave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...What?!”</span></p>
