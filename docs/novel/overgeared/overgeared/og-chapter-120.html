 <p><span style="">Chapter 120</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>‘What? What’s this?’</p>
 <p><span style="">Dong Pao was greatly confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The road from Rolling to the Vatican was originally very peaceful. The paladins regularly scouted, so it was difficult to find thieves, monsters and beasts. It could be called one of the few safe zones on the continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, today the monsters popped out without any hesitation. Just like water pouring from a collapsed dam, the monsters swooped down and attacked Grid and Dong Pao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pant... Pant... There are so many monsters in the vicinity...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to that, Dong Pao was exhausted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It had been less than a hour since they left Rolling, and they had already fought over 100 monsters without a break. His mana had been depleted a few times, making him drink mana potions. Now his stamina was going to be depleted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pant pant! Strange! Really strange! I’ve used this road several hundred times, but it is the first time I’ve seen this! Pant pant!”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dong Pao couldn’t accept the current situation. He struggled to use Heal on Grid, who was killing the lizardmen surrounding them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Why are there so many monsters here... Strange!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They needed to move 15km more to reach the point he was supposed to lure Grid. But monsters kept showing up, so it seemed like the two people would lose their lives before even reaching the target.&nbsp;</span><span style="">How many people met and died from monsters in the safety zones? Perhaps he would be the first. How unfair and embarrassing was this?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dong Pao despaired.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then the source of this incident, Grid furtively took off his cloak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I currently have a healing shuttle... Unfortunately, it’s time for a break.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Malacus’ Cloak has been unequipped.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Malacus’ Cloak gave off a bloody scent that attracted all types of monsters hiding in the vicinity.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As soon as Grid put the cloak into the inventory, no more monsters appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Dong Pao was too busy to observe Grid properly, so he didn’t realize that Grid was the source.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid dealt with the remaining monsters.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kiyaaaaak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have defeated a giant salamander.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Party leader ‘Grid’ has acquired the salamander’s gallbladder.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Party leader ‘Grid’ has acquired the rare pearl.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[203,000 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have defeated an iran clan lizardman.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Party leader ‘Grid’ has acquired the Usable Scimitar.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Party leader ‘Grid’ has acquired a sapphire.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[255,000 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dran Valley, where crystal clear water flowed!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The monsters here were much stronger than the monsters of Suaz Mountains. They had a minimum level of 190 and higher, so even Grid struggled if there were more than seven monsters. However, he had Dong Pao’s healing, so he could successfully hunt them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'The Heal of a level 160 priest is truly tremendous. Kukuk, I can wait to go to the Vatican as long as I have this heal shuttle.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was delighted because he gained a tremendous amount of experience, despite being in a party with Dong Pao. However, he made a disgruntled facial expression and groaned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Phew, I thought I was going to die. This is the first time I’ve seen so many monsters. Was this area originally like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dong Pao shook his head at Grid’s words.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I don’t know what’s going on. Originally, this is a place where monsters rarely pop up... I didn’t even know that there were so many monsters here. I have goosebumps... Sigh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dong Pao peeked at the dagger held in Grid’s hands while he was lamenting.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'There is a deep blue aura like sea around that dagger... It’s a weapon enhanced to at least +8. Huge.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was after he joined the party with Grid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">He originally thought that Grid managed to come to Rolling alone, despite being only level 147, was purely because of luck.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now that they’d fought together, he realized that Grid was really strong compared to his level. The reason Grid was able to cross the Suaz Mountains wasn’t because of luck, but because of strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The secret of his strength is that +8 dagger... A dagger might be weak in attack power compared to a one-handed sword or blunt weapon, but... A dagger enhanced to this extent can deal more damage than a blunt weapon.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A dagger had a fast attack speed, but weak attack power. However, Grid’s dagger had both excellent attack speed and attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He must be quite rich if he is carrying that weapon. Okay, I can get more profit than I thought. If I can take this dagger...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is enough rest.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">As Dong Pao was smiling nastily, Grid put on Malacus’ Cloak. He got up from his seat and urged Dong Pao.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“It is time to move. We don’t want to be too late.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes... But before that...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dong Pao stared at Grid with sharp eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid thought Dong Pao noticed Malacus’ Cloak and gulped.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Dong Pao said to him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Item distribution... Can you change it to sequential distribution instead of party leader distribution? Brother, let’s be fair.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Just keep it as party leader distribution for now. With sequential distribution, the expensive items might be given to only one person and that isn’t fair. We’ll split the proceeds in half once we arrive at the destination, so don’t worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No, but...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s destination was the Vatican. But Dong Pao’s planned destination was a place where Grid would die before he arrived at the Vatican.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If the item distribution method wasn’t changed now, Dong Pao wouldn’t receive the items. So he wanted to change it to sequential distribution.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Grid was stubborn. Ho was already walking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Damn bastard!’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dong Pao cursed to himself. Then he tried to think positively. </span><span style="">'Yes, I will get a lot of money from him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dong Pao smiled as he watched the quickly walking Grid. He thought that Grid’s urgent demand was funny.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the smile on Dong Pao’s face quickly disappeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Had it been five minutes since they started walking again?&nbsp;</span><span style="">New monsters appeared like a cloud and Dong Pao went crazy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What the hell is this? Why do these monsters keep constantly appearing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Didn’t you do hard quests as part of the Rebecca Church? Perhaps this is a trial from Goddess Rebecca?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was using method acting. He was good at pretending that he wasn’t the source attracting the monsters.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a result, Dong Pao didn’t suspect Grid at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No! I’ve never heard of a trial that involved hunting monsters! And a quest window didn’t pop up...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hrmm... Please support me while I’m taking care of them. Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dong Pao was depressed at the thought of consuming so many expensive mana potions. On the other hand, Grid was rejoicing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have a free heal shuttle so I should use it as much as possible!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had been aiming for this since he got a party with a healer for free. Until they arrived at the Vatican, he was going to rely on Dong Pao’s healing for infinite hunting.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dong Pao was aiming for Grid’s life while Grid was aiming to use him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The two men continued the repeated hunting and...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh! I also levelled up...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Just 12 hours after leaving Rolling!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid gained three levels while Dong Pao gained one level.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was surprising for Dong Pao.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were hunting high level monsters with only two people, so their level rose quickly. It was better than hunting with a few high level parties.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Like Grid, he wanted to stay in this place for a while to hunt. If he could do that, he could challenge becoming a ranker.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he was soon reminded of his original goals.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Money is more important than levelling.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Crime Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Originally, they should’ve arrived here 3 hours after leaving Rolling. But it took them 12 hours.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dong Pao wondered if the assassins were tired and resentful from waiting.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He felt anxious and urged Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Brother, let’s take a break in that cave over there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid turned his head in Dong Pao’s direction and was able to discover the entrance to a cave. Then he said with a reluctant look.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Do we need to rest? Shouldn’t we go straight to the Vatican with this momentum?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dong Pao tried to convince him,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Unlike Brother, my stamina has reached its limit several times. I need sufficient rest. My mana regeneration is too slow right now... It is to the point that I can only use Heal a few times.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It can’t be helped.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Thank you for your consideration.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid received Dong Pao’s guidance and entered the cave.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then a notification window flashed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Vampire Countess Marie Rose is sealed in this space.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Marie Rose’s evil influence makes your magic power turbid. All types of spells and skills aren’t available.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was bewildered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is this a raid room? Vampire countess? The vampire barons are fearful enough, yet this is a vampire countess? Are we going to have our blood sucked and die here? Why are we resting in this dangerous space...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dong Pao shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don't worry. Marie Rose has been sleeping for hundreds of years since she was sealed by two of Rebecca’s Daughters... She never wakes up. It isn’t Marie Rose you should be worrying about right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was startled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the end of Dong Pao’s words, three shadows appeared from the darkness.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were assassins who were with Dong Pao.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They blocked the entrance of the cave so that Grid couldn’t escape, and glared at Dong Pao.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why are you so late?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dong Pao explained,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Strangely, monsters kept showing up. We were forced to slow down while handling them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 13th ranked assassin, Sniffer didn’t believe it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Monsters? If you want to lie, do it properly. Isn’t it hard to find one wolf in the area, let alone monsters? This is why I hate the Chinese. You bluff every time you open your mouth!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It isn’t a lie. If you don't believe me, check it out yourself later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay. I understand, so stop.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">The 11th ranked Kerb didn’t want to waste any more time. He calmed down the situation and aimed two daggers at Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Hey. If you don’t want to die and lose experience, give us your money. Then we’ll spare your life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Assassins were specialized in assassination.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Their class change quest was assassination, and they received additional rewards depending on how many people were assassinated. The assassins steadily performed assassinations and gained a lot of experience fighting people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Assassins were able to show off their unique presence in this place where all types of skills were suppressed due to Marie Rose.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They also had numerical superiority, so Kerb didn’t doubt that they could handle Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, Grid grasped the situation and asked Dong Pao.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dong Pao, don’t priests of the Rebecca Church have to obey the laws? Isn’t it against their doctrines to harm the lives of travellers for money? This act of betraying Goddess Rebecca, doesn’t it have fatal consequences to you as a priest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dong Pao shook his head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“A lot of people are confused. They think that Rebecca priests must always follow the laws and doctrines to keep their position. But the reality was different. We have to only obey the law during the quest period. It doesn’t matter what wrongdoings I do if it isn’t discovered by the church.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Isn’t your divine power stat strengthened by following the laws and doctrines? Rather than acting for immediate profits, isn’t it better in the long run to follow the laws and raise your divine power?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">To Dong Pao, Grid seemed desperate to live. He felt very sympathetic towards the pathetic persuasion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Brother, have you forgotten what I said earlier? We have something called prayer. Divine power can be raised through praying, so I don’t need to worry about following the laws. I don’t deny Goddess Rebecca, despite committing evil. I deeply believe in, admire and love the goddess in my heart. My loyalty to the goddess is so deep that even now, my divine power is rising slowly and steadily.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It is still unknown to the outside, but the Rebecca Pope is a very depraved person. The pope often breaks the laws and doctrines of the church. But his divine power is enough to transcend common sense. His belief in Goddess Rebecca is absolute.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That’s just a contradiction.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">The 7th assassin Shay came forward. He thought that the Rebecca Church was very silly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"The Yatan Church is the one that stands for pure evil. They believe that evil is the right way. But the people from the Rebecca Church commit atrocities, even though they realize they have to do good deeds. The front and back are different, so they are far sneakier and more dangerous than the Yatan Church. Well, it has nothing to do with us... Give us your money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid examined Shay’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He is armed with top-notch items. At least level 200...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Legendary Blackmsith’s Discernment skill allowed him to gauge the level of the items that Shay was wearing. Thanks to that, Grid could see that Shay wasn’t an ordinary opponent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Rankers. The other two people are even higher than Dong Pao.'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'... They are boring compared to Faker.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was in the same guild as the 1st ranked assassin, Faker.. He had witnessed Faker’s skills several times.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, he didn’t feel afraid in front of these people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You guys, you have picked the wrong prey to hunt.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid armed himself with two items that had been in his inventory the entire time he was with Dong Pao.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Dainsleif (Reproduction) has been equipped.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Frostlight Orc Chief’s Helmet has been equipped.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...This guy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dong Pao and the assassins were astonished when they saw Grid pull out a black greatsword and a bizarre skull helmet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wasn’t he the famous slaughterer who wiped out the Giant Guild not long ago?&nbsp;</span><span style="">They didn’t expect it at all.</span></p>
