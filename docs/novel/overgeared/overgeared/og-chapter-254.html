 <p><span style="">Chapter 254</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Genius at fighting’ Hao.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a ranker who represented the Chinese people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The members of the Hades Guild, who he selected and trained himself, were very strong.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They tended to be evaluated lower because of their small size, but that was just from people who weren’t aware.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Hades Guild’s presence was assured within the seven guilds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had an average level of 253.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was overwhelming high, despite their small number.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">A perfect unit of individuals.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was a hierarchical relationship like in the army, and there was excellent teamwork and tactical abilities...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The combat power of the Hades Guild was among the top in the seven guilds.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kieek!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kyaak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The moonlight that shone on the night desert.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Hades Guild marched unceasingly under Hao’s command.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The cold temperature, sandy terrain and strong desert monsters didn’t slow down their march.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Isn’t this place the best hunting ground?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It’s the reason why the levels of the Overgeared members soared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The desert monsters were over level 300, so they gave a lot of experience.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was more than imagined. Thanks to this, the level of the Hades Guild members quickly rose.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Hades Guild wanted to stay here to level up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao prompted them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Don’t be immersed in battle and speed up your march.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao was still nervous. He wondered if pursuers would catch up with them and kept looking back. He was clearly on the edge.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The farmer called Piaro killed Zibal in one shot, but the Hades Guild couldn’t understand why their master was afraid of the farmer who took a while to kill Seuron.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The farmer who defeated Seuron is strong, but isn’t he less than the one called Piaro? I don’t know why you’re so afraid of him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao spoke the truth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“The farmer who killed Seuron is the sky above the sky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sky above the sky...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Only one person came to mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Do you meant Kraugel?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes. The straw hat hid his identity, but I was able to recognize him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was the only one who Hao admired and was afraid of.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Hades Guild could understand why their master was so irritated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Hades Guild members made a fuss.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is a serious problem. If Kraugel is Grid’s subordinate...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was already laying the groundwork to be the best force. If Kraugel was added, the growth rate would be unmatched.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hao calmed the guild members who were greatly concerned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kraugel isn’t Grid’s subordinate. They are just cooperating a while for some reason."&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kraugel was the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"He is an individual existence who won’t be under someone else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao promised, but the Hades Guild members were still worried.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had already absorbed the Tzedakah Guild... They wondered if he really could obtain Kraugel as well.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But they didn’t speak these thoughts out loud. It was only a guess and they didn’t want to worry Hao.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hurry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They moved away from Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They would soon reach the end of the desert and enter the empire’s territory. Then they would be safe.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Hades Guild’s march accelerated. Nobody seemed able to stop them as they slaughtered the desert monsters while moving forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But life was a series of walls.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Once they crossed one wall, a new wall was waiting for them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was a story that applied to everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Stop here.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">A voice stopped the Hades Guild, as if the person knew they would come here.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Even if you are leaving, shouldn’t you be punished?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The youth with silver hair.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">One of the 10 Rookies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, it was funny to call him a rookie now.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had grown at a monstrous rate after joining Overgeared and was now one of the powerhouses in this world.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The price for stepping on Duke Grid’s territory with your dirty feet, pay it with your lives.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel spoke coldly while the Overgeared members stared grimly from behind him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hao looked at their faces and stiffened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'They might have fewer people, but...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were 28 members in the Overgeared Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid was in the empire, Ruby and Sexy Schoolgirl were novices, and Jishuka was active in Bairan with three other members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In addition, Pon, Regas and Euphemina were on separate missions, while Vantner’s group was engaged with the Golden Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Except for Lauel, there were only 15 people present.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Meanwhile, the Hades Guild had 80 people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Hades Guild clearly had the advantage. The difference in numbers was too big.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But battles in Satisfy were more about quality than quantity. Hao was reminded of this truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 15 members of Overgeared were 3rd advancement users, while the 80 members of the Hades Guild were 2nd advancement users.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members’ victory was obvious.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hao made a judgment call and ordered the guild members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{All of you, run away.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Hades Guild members were upset by the command.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Run away?}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{What are you saying?}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{I will stop the enemies. Run away through the gap.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Once again, the Hades Guild members didn’t like the order.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Surviving by sacrificing their master?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their loyalty couldn’t allow it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Master should escape while we buy some time.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{We can’t pass Master to the enemies.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao scolded the rebelling Hades Guild members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{The power of the guild will fall rapidly if all of you are wiped out here. Retreat.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sacrificing 79 people or sacrificing one person.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Looking at it, the latter was clearly the wiser choice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Hades Guild knew this better than anyone else. But Hao was 16th on the unified rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The level difference between the 11th rank and 50th rank was only four levels, so Hao’s ranking would fall exponentially if he died and lost experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{The rankings is a mere symbol, so don’t get bogged down with it. Run away. We can plan our revenge later.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Hades Guild would eventually get their third advancement classes. Once the gap of power was reduced, it would be possible to crush the Overgeared members. The present disgrace would be paid back at that time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{...I understand.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Hades Guild members backed off as they saw their guild master’s determination.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Where are you going?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members couldn’t let them go. No mercy could be shown to the invaders.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They tried to chase after the Hades Guild members running away, but Hao blocked their way. He pulled out an iron bar and drew a line in the sand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What did this line in the sand mean? The Overgeared members couldn’t understand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hao let them know the meaning of the line.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"For the next five minutes, you can’t cross this line.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Satisfy didn’t have a species selection function. When a character was created, users unconditionally started the game with the ‘human’ species.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If so, did this mean that all two billion users were humans?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That wasn’t the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a minority, but a few users were different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were certain quests that would change a user’s species.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hao completed one of them.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeok!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The sides of Hao’s shoulders and back, as well as the skin near the chest and abdomen were split open, revealing the red scales hidden inside.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Flap.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A pair of wings emerged from his back, while the whites and the pupils of his eyes turned gold.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Half draconian.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That was Hao.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The power of a draconian increased his strength, agility, health and resistance by 10%. He also got an incomplete flying ability and fire ability.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The disadvantage was that he couldn’t use most of the skills available to humans, but the draconian Hao was less likely to rely on skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had the ultimate physical form, so he relied on this and secondary weapons to win.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The transformation into a draconian maximized his combat power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Toban, Laella and Zednos. The three of you, please handle Hao. The remaining personnel will chase after and destroy the enemies.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel ordered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hao was one of the strongest PK users, so three people should be enough to handle him. Lauel judged the situation and issued the command.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Only three? Are you looking down on me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao scoffed as he saw the three people take a triangular formation.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chwaruruk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao suddenly used a chain and pulled Toban’s shield towards him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was very fast and delicate control. Toban wasn’t prepared and his body leaned heavily forward.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hao hit the back of his head with the iron bar then aimed at Laella.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The bewildered Laella defended with magic stored in her orb, but her mistake was using non-targeted magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was virtually impossible to hit Hao with non-targeted spells.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the reason why the 5th ranked Yura evaluated that she wouldn’t win against Hao.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kyak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The weapon accurately struck Laella’s heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She suffered a great deal of damage and sat down. Hao didn’t hesitate as he linked a combo to kill her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shit! Stop it quickly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Laella cried out and Ibellin moved.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The blue flamberge that Grid made for him after his third advancement class tore towards Hao.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Newbie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao burst out laughing. Ibellin came at him from the front with such a low level of skill.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chwaruruk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A secondary weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were difficult to control, so most users didn’t use them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao had the Secondary Weapons Mastery. He threw a chain and tied up Ibellin’s wrist. Then he used the power of the draconians to blow him away, before aiming his iron rod at Laella’s belly again. Laella’s body was thrown into the air, then the iron bar rotated and hit Laell’a slender neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Uh...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Laella groaned as her blood soaked the sand. As a magician, she couldn’t bear Hao’s attack power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She would’ve died already if it wasn’t for Toban’s defense buff and Zednos’ shield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hao saw that she was stunned and aimed at Zednos. Zednos didn’t have time to cast a spell due to Hao’s speed, and had to concentrate on defense. Then a shield appeared before him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban had recovered and protected Zednos.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Something unbelievable happened the moment the iron bar collided with the large shield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared Guild’s strongest tanker. No, the best ranker in Satisfy, Toban was pushed back two steps.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban expressed his displeasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This guy!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao was able to pinpoint exactly where to hit on Toban’s shield to apply great pressure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Toban felt like he was facing Piaro. Hao’s skills were truly amazing. At the very least, he was on the level of Pon and Regas.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao looked around at the Overgeared members and declared,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Four minutes. I can endure for four more minutes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was already one minute after his five minute declaration.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Hades Guild was gradually moving away from this spot.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After four minutes, it would be too difficult to chase them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel was irritated and changed his order.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"First of all, take him down first!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members aimed all their power at Hao.</span></p>
