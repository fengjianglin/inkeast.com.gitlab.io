 <p><span style="">Chapter 383</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The key to firing quickly was the resilience of the bow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the reason why a drake’s tendon was one of the materials necessary to produce the Quick Fire Bow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Drake.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The strongest pet that a player could tame.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It had excellent combat power and was difficult to hunt due to its high intelligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the first place, they were hard to find because the population was low.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even if they found a drake, players were more inclined to tame them than hunt them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">For these reasons, it was difficult to obtain a drake’s tendons, and the price was very expensive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Despite only having a small number of users, the minimum price was 10,000 gold each.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid might be wealthy, but it was a huge burden to invest a lot of it into expensive materials.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have to be satisfied with this one.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Spiral Quick Fire Bow]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Attack Power: 215~249 &nbsp;&nbsp;Firing Speed: +17%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Accuracy: -30%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Every time you shoot an arrow, the firing speed will increase by 1%. This effect will only be applied up to 50%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* It is difficult to control the trajectory of the arrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* If you hit the ‘desired target’, you will gain additional Bow Mastery experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Honestly, Grid wasn’t satisfied. However, this was the best of the five bows that Grid made.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is enough if it increases the experience rate of the mastery skill.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Anyway, his intentions were achieved.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid would raise the level of Bow Mastery by controlling the trajectory of the arrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There is a lot of work to do before the National Competition.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He needed to raise the level of his newly learned skills while attacking the Behen Archipelago. he also needed to figure out his deficiencies while doing it and create new items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were 40 days left in real time until the National Competition started, and Grid planned to increase his gameplay time even further.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The only space where he could prove his worth was in Satisfy, which he devoted his life to.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Which country do you think will win the 2nd National Competition? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the latest international news.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Once the anchor asked a question, the experts in each field came up with enthusiastic answers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The United States will be first. The average level of the US team participants is the highest of all the participating countries. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The United States has many top rankers such as Zibal, Asuka, Lauel, Box, and Black Teddy. Unlike last year, I don’t think Hurent is participating, but the power balance is much better than other countries. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 But won’t Lauel act as a variable? Isn’t Lauel one of the closest people to Grid in Overgeared? During the competition, it’s possible that he will help South Korea, not the United States... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The Overgeared members aren’t young three year olds who can’t distinguish between different matters. They know that the National Competition is classified as a different area. 』&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 In the first place, there’s no need to be concerned. Helping other nations is a violation of the rules and they won’t be able to escape severe punishment. Not just Lauel, but all the other Overgeared members will keep this in mind. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was logical.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In fact, the Overgeared members were going to fight for the honor of their country in the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was destined to face Lauel’s smarts, as well as competing against the members such as Pon, Regas, and Faker.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Who are other contenders apart from the United States? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Canada and France have the most top rankers next to the United States. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 What about South Korea, who have Grid and Yura, or Russia, who has Kraugel? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The 2nd National Competition is very different from the 1st National Competition. There are more events and some rules have changed, so it’s impossible for a few players to raise a country. South Korea will be in the top 15, while Russia will be in the top 18. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Isn’t South Korea still too high? Isn’t it a country without any rankers except for Grid, Yura, and Peak Sword? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Of course, on the surface, South Korea is classified as a weak team. But Yura is a variable. If she obtained a unique hidden class as rumored... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the 1st National Competition, South Korea was classified as the weakest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most of the participating countries looked down on South Korea.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Compared to that time, the evaluation of South Korea in the 2nd National Competition was very good.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reactions of the Korean people varied.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Why are they ignoring South Korea?</span></i> <i><span style="">Did they forget Korea’s third place last year?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I agree.</span></i> <i><span style="">Even last year, Peak Sword didn’t participate.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yura was just a normal class.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">But this year, we will get a better ranking because we have Peak Sword and Yura, who has a hidden class.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">South Korea can be one of the contenders for victory.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Are the people from the Patriotic Association bombarding the message boards?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">What was the reason why Korea could get the 3rd ranking last year?</span></i> <i><span style="">Grid was too good.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Correct.</span></i> <i><span style="">South Korea is still a country weak in Satisfy.</span></i> <i><span style="">Last year, Grid won all three gold medals for South Korea. This year and last year, the overall power of South Korea is too weak.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Don’t you think that Grid can win three gold medals this year?</span></i> <i><span style="">Of course.</span></i> <i><span style="">He is God Grid.</span></i> <i><span style="">But the problem is that the value of the gold medals this year is very different from last year.</span></i> <i><span style="">In last year’s National Competition, there were nine events. But now there are 21 events.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Peak Sword?</span></i> <i><span style="">In other countries, Peak Sword is just an average player. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">There were also skeptics.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As it happened, most Koreans shared negative opinions like this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword was irritated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s so funny that I have to sit down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Patriotic Association’s headquarters in Seoul.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword accessed the Internet as soon as he logged out, and now his expression distorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"They are underestimating God Grid and South Korea. And what? I only have average skills in other countries? These guys, do you know Peak Sword?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword’s enthusiasm grew.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had to make South Korea the winner of the 2nd National Competition...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...It seems too fanciful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword thought realistically.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would make South Korea enter the top 10 rankings of the 2nd National Competition. Step by step, he was hopeful that one day, South Korea would raise its status in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Up until this point, people around the world, including Peak Sword, were unaware of something.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was just the opening of the legend of Grid and the Overgeared Guild.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid, Grid, Grid, Grid, Grid, Grid, Grid!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This name was heard if the TV or radio was turned out, from phones, in the newspapers, on the Internet and even when neighborhood aunties gathered together.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was only talk about the National Competition and Grid everywhere in South Korea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was enough to drive Go Jimyung crazy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Damn Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Go Jimyung.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A player of the KBO League.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He once had the reputation of the best hitter in South Korea. However, since last year, he entered a relationship with the leader of the girl group Farina and his performance fell, as well as being caught up in a series of accidents.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t just a level to be dropped from the team, but an exit from the league itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the Young Ladies High School’s Satisfy tournament, Go Jimyung was asked by his girlfriend to defeat Ruby.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He risked breaking the rules to kill Ruby, but failed due to Grid getting in his way. In the aftermath of that, he was pushed to his current crisis.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had been branded as garbage by the public and his girlfriend broke up with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Go Jimyung considered the cause of this to be Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the typical blaming everything on others.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I won’t forgive you.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaduduk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Go Jimyung went somewhere.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was to call the chief of the big gang ‘Poisonous Wave,’ who lived in the back world of Seoul.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">"We’ll check on the building and sleep at Grandpa’s house.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo’s parents and sister went on a family outing after a long time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Of course, Youngwoo didn’t go with them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because he was busy preparing for the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Please stay healthy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As soon as his family members left, Youngwoo logged straight back into Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was someone waiting for him.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">000-0 Street, XX Neighborhood, Geumcheon-gu.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was a famous resident of the area.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was also a place where people constantly went in order to meet Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But due to the opposition of the residents, the district council designated it as a out-of-bounds area and the defense was tight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As a result, Grid’s neighborhood changed into one that was good to live in.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s popularity in the area skyrocketed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why does a poor area like this have the same defense as the palace?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The person in charge of distributing drugs for the Poisonous Wave gang, Kang Cheolgyu.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was known as one of the Five Fingers in Seoul due to his excellent punching skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Go Jimyung was a senior from his hometown, so it was easy for Kang Cheolgyu to accept the request to cripple someone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The problem was reaching the target’s house.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It unexpectedly took him two hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will charge another 500 million won.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kang Cheolgyu had a sly smile on his face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His eyes were looking at the 800 million won car in front of the target’s home.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid. Grid...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">More Koreans set up Grid as a hero, but Kang Cheolgyu thought it was ridiculous.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The hero of their country was a gamer?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kang Cheolgyu wasn’t able to understand the psychology of people who were so enthusiastic about a gaming contest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Drink alcohol over playing games, stupid people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kang Cheolgyu waited for Grid’s door to open.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He planned to aim for the moment when Grid left the house.&nbsp;</span><span style="">For 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours... 10 hours passed, but Grid’s door never opened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid wasn’t coming out?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a cold autumn night.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kang Cheolgyu was weak to the cold, so his complexion gradually became worn down.</span></p>
