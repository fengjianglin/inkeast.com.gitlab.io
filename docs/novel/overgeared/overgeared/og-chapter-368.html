 <p><span style="">Chapter 368</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“G-Grid has 92 points!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have set a new record in Patrian’s reserve forces training Archery Test!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your understanding of archery, the bow, and arrows is higher than your ability.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[An ability correction will be applied to the hidden compensation.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The normal skill ‘Bow Mastery’ has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Bow Mastery]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Beginner: Lv.1</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You can handle all types of bows.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">When equipped with a bow, attack power and hit rate will increase by 4%, and the probability of a critical hit will increase in proportion to agility.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Current Critical Hit Probability Increase: 0%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Bow Mastery!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An archer had been described many times as a class that exerted a unique physical attack power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reason?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was thanks to the Bow Mastery skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bow Mastery had the highest attack and accuracy rate of all masteries, and was the source of an archer’s power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I never thought I would get Bow Mastery.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was strong at a distance because he had Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Transcend, and Transcended Link, as well as Magic Missile.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But that was a story when he had enough mana. The skill cooldown time was also a problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘On the other hand, a bow guarantees steady attacks if there are enough arrows.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid referred to Piaro’s stats distribution when increasing his agility.&nbsp;</span><span style="">For him, Bow Mastery was a very good passive skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If I can get Weapons Mastery as well...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The foundation for further strengthening would be completed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s body shivered as he thought about it.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The stats of the level 23 Grid were a mess, but the level of the reserve troops participating in the training were only level 20.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was at the top of the rankings and won in the sparring. He completely overpowered his opponent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The top graduate, Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Clap clap clap!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The training graduation ceremony.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Instructor Kaesul called out his name and the assistants and reservists clapped.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had shown enough during the training to be respected by everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Not Pagma’s Descendant...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Shin Youngwoo’ was the one acknowledged.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was beyond thrilled by his own growth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid smiled and walked up to the stage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have taken the top position in the training of Patrian’s reserve forces!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have obtained the first prize ‘Senior Reserve Forces Citation’.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Senior Reserve Forces Citation]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You have become the role model for the Patrian reservists.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I want to thank you for your enthusiasm during training.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Earl Ashur-</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"???"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Surely that wasn’t it?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was expecting more from the compensation, so confusion filled his face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Instructor Kaesul smiled at him and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It is an honor to receive a citation from Earl Ashur, lord of Patrian, and a great magician of the continent. It is an heirloom that can be passed on to your descendants.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This nonsense... There isn’t a separate compensation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment that Grid asked this question.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Mission success!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have cleared the 31st island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have acquired 600 challenger points for the mission success.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your level has returned to normal.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The skills Spear Shot, Continuous Stab, and Bow Mastery have been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Shaaaaah-</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The fortified city of Patrien, Instructor Kaesul, the assistants, and the reservists.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The perfect reproduction of the 31st island scattered like a mirage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was left alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He changed his mind about tearing up Earl Ashur’s citation and throwing it away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...It isn’t bad to keep it as a memento.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the first award he received in his life.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His personal feelings towards Earl Ashur had already been resolved to a certain extent, so Grid placed the citation on one side of his inventory.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Reidan went through a big change while Grid was away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">First of all, the monsters around the yellow mithril mine dried up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was thanks to the great success of the knights who raised their level in Winston and returned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Reidan was now able to extract the yellow mithril in earnest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The yellow mithril caused a remarkable growth in the alchemy technology of Reidan, thanks to the fairy dust. It finally reached a level where alchemy could be combined with blacksmithing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Secondly, the magical talents of the ‘Ul Clan’ that Grid rescued from the empire had blossomed from the steady education.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Reidan now had 930 magicians.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Among them was Princess Hwarin of the Ul Clan, whose ability was unrivalled. The unique rated passive skill, ‘party’s magic power increased by 30%’ was a treasure for the magicians.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thirdly, the farming area of Reidan extended to the Altes Mountains. This would increase food production by three times.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel was confused,&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘There is a limited number of farmers, so how has Piaro developed agriculture to this degree? Surely he didn’t do all that work alone?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel wasn’t yet aware that Aura Master Hurent and Pet Master Nyangmong were being held by Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Fourthly, a Rebecca Temple started to be built under Pope Damian’s authority.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Rebecca Temple would give a big blessing to the city and foster healers, so the population of Reidan would increase dramatically.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Fifthly, the Rebecca’s Daughters candidates brought by Damian were incorporated into Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro trained them to become the best farmers in the future. No, they were going to be the paladin unit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel was worried about the fifth point.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is this too excessive?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rebecca’s Daughters were the absolute force of the Rebecca Church. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that without Rebecca’s Daughters, there would be no Rebecca Church.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Rebecca Church wouldn’t be convinced by Damian’s compassion for the candidates.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You might get kicked out of the pope position before you can finish your term. Your tenure needs to last in order to help Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The power of the pope was mighty. It was best to aim for remaining pope for the rest of his life.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Damian might lose his position just because of a few girls.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel felt like he was stupid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Damian was stubborn.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The reason I became pope was because I hoped a second Isabel, Rin and Luna wouldn’t be born. You can’t imagine it. The pain of the young girls who are stuck in a facility, undergoing constant brainwashing and hard training... Being used as a weapon for all their lives, it isn’t possible for me to tell you how harsh it is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hrmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel was someone who would use and slaughter players to achieve his goal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t understand Damian, who empathized with NPCs.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he tried to understand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was close to NPCs like Irene, and had a child called Lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel had a duty to take into account Damian’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...To be honest, I still don’t understand you and Grid. However, I respect it. I will find a way to solidify your position that will be shaken by this incident.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian’s nervous face relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Thank you!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Contact with the vampire cities has been disconnected and the work I have to worry about is growing.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel’s dark circles thickened.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">All the islands in the 30’s reproduced the challenger’s past trials.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Situations where the challenger died a lot or failed a quest many times appeared sequentially.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The rankers were armed with excellent talents and skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">For those who didn’t play an easy game, the islands in the 30’s were a disaster.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Grid was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The trials that Grid suffered in the past, he could now easily overcome.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have entered the 40th island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[This is a save point. Do you want to save your position?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have been registered. When you enter the Behen Archipelago later on, you will start from the 40th island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That is amazing. It’s really wonderful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sticks kept praising Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wasn’t able to overcome his trials, and he was impressed by the fact that Grid grew in real time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What’s the big deal about catching orcs and goblins?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid responded with a smile and checked the time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I should rest for a while.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A total of one month had passed since he entered the Behen Archipelago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It took longer than expected, so Grid needed to manage his stamina.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After six hours of game connection, he adjusted his condition by logging out, eating, and exercising.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The harvest that I obtained from the islands in the 30’s is great.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Apart from Spear Shot, Continuous Strike, and Bow Mastery, he gained 7 strength and stamina, as well as 5 agility and intelligence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The rewards earned from the quest were cumulative, demonstrating the effect of two elixirs.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What were the rewards waiting for him on the remaining islands?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Behen Archipelago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was no place more appropriate for growth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It would be good to use it as a training place for the guild members before it is cleansed.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Tzedakah Guild, Yura, and Peak Sword were skilled enough to reach the 20th island.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If they could collect a few elixirs with the challenger points, Overgeared would become even stronger.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttiring~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Shin Youngwoo was thinking about this when a message arrived on his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">A mail has arrived.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is it the periodic report from Lauel?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo stopped running and opened the mail.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The third week of September.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <ol>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style=""> The alchemy facility has successfully studied yellow mithril, producing fairy dust.&nbsp;</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ol>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">* As soon as Grid returns, be prepared to try a fusion of alchemy and blacksmithing techniques.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <ol start="2">
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style=""> A magic unit has been constructed around Princess Hwarin of the Ul Clan.</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style=""> Piaro has expanded the farming area.</span></li>

  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style=""> It is now the 24th day of Satisfy time since the vampire expedition entered the 9th city. I have lost touch with them.</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ol>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo’s expression hardened as he read the contents of the mail.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Marie Rose.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The name of a transcendent being penetrated his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It can’t be...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo rushed back along the jogging course he had just run.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was breathing roughly, but didn’t easily collapse.</span></p>
