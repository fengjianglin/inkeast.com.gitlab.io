 <p><span style="">Chapter 419</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Skull and Lauel have been logged out!! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 The survivors of the US team have started to retreat. 』&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 It’s a big matter that Kraugel alone tied up three rankers. Russia has the numerical superiority. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Zibal survived, but his loss in power is severe. The United States seems to be getting further away from the medal. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Who could’ve imagined that a strong champion like the United States would be knocked out? Amazing! &nbsp;Kraugel is really great! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Since Satisfy’s opening, Kraugel had maintained his first place ranking on the unified rankings chart.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, due to his nature of acting alone without appearing in public, the public had no chance to get to know his skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They just guessed he was strong based on the few rankers who were witnesses.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">To be honest, the public thought that all the nicknames for Kraugel were exaggerated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But that changed today.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were able to realize it after seeing Kraugel directly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The rumors about Kraugel weren’t exaggerated. Rather, they weren’t accurate enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel was truly a transcendent figure.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“So what if the trivial monkey is good at fighting?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The skinheads of Russia showed extreme racism.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Over the past century, the number of Asians assaulted or killed by them was over 100,000.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Koryoin were no exception.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most Koreans voluntarily acquired Russian citizenship and lived in Russia for several generations, but they weren’t recognized by the skinheads. They were treated with threats and contempt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In 2005, there was a well known incident where the Koryoin Russian karate champion, ‘Yakov Khan’ was murdered by skinheads. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What are you doing? The competition isn't over yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Alexander.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a skinhead and 22nd on the overall rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He treated Kraugel as less than a human.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t cheer, honor, or respect Kraugel, who played a bigger role than anyone else. He was just like a dog.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel led Russia to victory by defeating Jishuka, Skull, and Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t even hold his body up properly as Alexander whispered to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Shake it off and keep going. Don’t you have to work hard to treat your mother’s disease?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? You’re not getting up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Alexander knew why Kraugel was in this National Competition and thoroughly took advantage of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Oh, I’m not feeling motivated anymore. I am tired of playing in the National Competition, so how about I quit and take a break?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m sorry. I’ll get up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel restrained Alexander, who was about to lie down, and barely got up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His legs were staggering as Alexander pointed to the scoreboard.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"While we were fighting the United States, South Korea took back the number one spot. If you don’t want to miss out on the gold medal, you need to shatter them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...I will do so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A new medicine that could treat his mother’s disease.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It would take at least two years before it was commercialized.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kraugel couldn’t wait until then, so he firmed up his heart.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">1st. South Korea - 244 points. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">2nd. Russia - 195 points. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">3rd. United States - 167 points. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">4th. Canada - 153 points. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">5th. United Kingdom - 119 points. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s face was tense as he checked the scoreboard.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The score of the Russians has started to rise again.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It meant that the battle between the US and Russia ended in Russia’s victory</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"As expected from Kraugel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The average power of the United States was higher than Russia.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The US was only defeated due to the variable called Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura and Peak Sword hadn’t expected the current situation and were surprised, but Grid was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can’t play a more active role on this stage than Kraugel.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the past, Grid had defeated Kraugel because Kraugel wasn’t in a perfect state.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was natural for Kraugel to achieve all of this, since he was so strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hrmm."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">South Korea had once again regained first place, but their the situation wasn’t very good right now.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s God Hands were slowly and steadily accumulating points. However, Peak Sword was limited to close range damage, while Yura consumed mana with every shot.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura’s target processing speed was remarkably reduced and the targets flying through the sky were too small to handle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It would be a great help if Park Jonghwa was still alive.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid judged that Russia and Canada would eventually beat them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The secret to how Russia is able to reach here.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They actively utilized the weapon called Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kraugel moved through Tira, fighting the elements that threatened Russia alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And right now, the country threatened Russia was South Korea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel needed to move again for Russia to get a more definitive victory.&nbsp;</span><span style="">South Korea would be a target.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Kraugel will soon attack.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What will be the result if I fight against him?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘South Korea will lose.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Even if Grid caught Kraugel’s ankle, Yura and Peak Sword were the only ones handling the target, so the speed of scoring will be slow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, Russia would catch up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If Yura and Peak Sword can confront Kraugel...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was counterproductive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura had grown quickly through the vampire cities and the Behen Archipelago, but she was still only level 260. Peak Sword wasn’t Kraugel’s opponent in the first place.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid could only handle dozens of targets before the two people were logged out by Kraugel. Then Grid would be left alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The result where South Korea was defeated didn’t change.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘How to get first?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If Grid was an ordinary player, he would’ve abandoned the gold medal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid wasn’t a common player. Like Kraugel, he had a destructive power that overturned common sense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thus, he could do something.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What if I hit Russia?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yes, he didn’t have to take the risk of facing Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">While Kraugel ran to this place to confront Yura and Peak Sword, he would run and smash the Russian team.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Afterwards, avoid Kraugel’s pursuit and handle the targets with the God Hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Canada remained a problem, but Korea, Canada, and Russia weren’t the only countries remaining on the battlefield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Britain, Argentina, China, and Japan were still in a relatively good condition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were also aiming for a medal, so they would read the situation and keep Canada in check.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The cooldown of most skills had returned and his mana had recovered by quite a bit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid made a decision and spoke to Yura and Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Stand out so that you will be Kraugel’s target. Then when Kraugel attacks, escape as far as possible and buy some time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid, don’t tell me...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura was smart and Peak Sword had been the leader of a guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They figured out Grid’s plan at once.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Are you going to strike Russia alone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It’s too dangerous, even if you’re God Grid! Russia didn’t beat the United States just because of Kraugel. The average power of Russia is strong, especially Alexander...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Isn’t it high list, high return? If we want the best result, I have to take this risk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid cut off Peak Sword’s anxious words and entered the forest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword looked at his back with dismay and muttered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It is high risk, not high list...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kindergartens taught English these days, so shouldn’t he know more?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword felt very good about his English, despite only saying ‘Do you know?’</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“South Korea’s scoring rate has slowed down?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is Kraugel already raiding Korea’s base?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No, Kraugel is tired. It will take him a considerable amount of time to reach the Korean base, and even if he reaches it, he won’t pose a great threat to Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Then why is South Korea’s score rising so slowly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Are they frightened of Kraugel?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Well, there is Yura in the Korean team. She will quickly identify that she is Kraugel’s next target."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hahat! Cowards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Russian representatives were on top of the mountain that was originally the US team’s base.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a result, the speed of their scoring was very fast. It was at least five times faster than South Korea, so a reversal would happen soon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“But Alexander, isn’t it better not to bother Kraugel so much in the National Competition?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I also agree. Kraugel is currently our largest power. It could backfire if you keep crushing his pride and morale.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Apart from Alexander, the Russian team representatives didn’t know the real reason why Kraugel participated in the National Competition. They just thought he wanted a gold medal and a reward like themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Alexander snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don't worry. He wants to win the championship for Russia more than anyone else. He will do his best to the end, even if he’s treated as a dog.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Alexander disliked Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He felt honored to participate in order to make Russia great, and couldn’t stand the attitude of someone who participated for personal reasons. Thus, he wanted to crush Kraugel even more.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Russian representatives were chatting while handling the targets.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Are you harassing Kraugel? Hyenas are bothering a lion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a familiar but also unfamiliar voice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Alexander and the other Russian rankers looked in the direction of the voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why was this bastard here?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Russian representatives quickly figured out the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hoh, I see. You want to hit us while Kraugel hits South Korea?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They felt grateful.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Planning to raid us alone, you’re crazy. Didn’t you just come here to die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You hit a couple of small fries and think you are so great?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You aren’t Kraugel. Did you call us hyenas and Kraugel a lion? Then you are a dog, a dog.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had been bullied throughout school and disliked harassment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He could roughly guess Kraugel’s position after hearing the conversation of the Russian rankers, so his eyes were sharp.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m a tiger, dumb bastards.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Before arriving here, Grid used the Item Combination skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">By combining Grid’s Greatsword and Failure, he held the weapon with the highest attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Transcended Link. And Linked Kill Wave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The bombardment struck the Russian team.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The energy blades, which were more threatening than a storm, destroyed the edge of the mountain peak.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unlike Lauel, who caused a landslide by taking advantage of the terrain, Grid caused a landslide using pure destructive power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Russian representatives screamed as they were hit.</span></p>
