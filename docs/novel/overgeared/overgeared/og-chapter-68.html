 <p><span style="">Chapter 68</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>‘I can use this to avoid the monsters in Kesan Canyon, then I can sell them to people and quickly pay off my debt.’</p>
 <p><span style="">Grid felt tremendous satisfaction as he saw the Hooded Zip Up that he created.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Am I surprisingly a hidden genius? I actually created such a fraudulent item!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The materials required to create the Hooded Zip Up were 20 sylphid scales.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid asked Khan with a light heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Where do the sylphids live? Do I need to hunt them to get the scales?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hmm?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan looked surprised at my question, then burst out laughing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Hahaha! What? Hunt the sylphids? What are you saying? Unless you’re an elementalist, it’s impossible to find sylphids with the human eyes. But hunting them? Hahahaha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was like a bolt out of the blue.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s face turned red. Then he grabbed Khan and shouted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“No, what? You should’ve told me sooner! Then where can I obtain sylphid scales?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was sincerely angry. He was afraid this would be the same as Failure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have already created the production method! I must obtain the materials to make it!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan was confused by Grid’s appearance and hurriedly explained,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Sylphids can’t be found, but there is a way to obtain their scales. Just hunt the frostlight orcs. Then you will be able to obtain the sylphid scales.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Frostlight orcs? What are they? How can I obtain sylphid scales from them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid &nbsp;really didn’t know anything. No, it was more appropriate to say the sylphid scales and frostlight orcs were unfamiliar to general users.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the case of the sylphids, they were classified as elementals, so most people didn’t even know they existed. Meanwhile, the frostlight orcs lived far from people, so they weren’t well known.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The frostlight orcs are monsters inhabiting the snowy north. They have blue skin, unlike the regular orcs with green skin, more intelligence, and are 1.5 times greater in size. They are extremely strong against the cold, but their weakness is fire.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What’s the relationship between them and the sylphids?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The frostlight orcs have a sixth sense that can detect and hunt sylphids. They like to keep the sylphid scales as treasures. In other words, you can obtain sylphid scales if you hunt the frostlight orcs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh! Okay! Orcs are easy to hunt, so I’ll gather a lot of scales!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was different from Failure. The materials to make it could be obtained. Khan watched the excited Grid with concerned eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hey Grid, stay alert. As I mentioned, the frostlight orcs are different from common orcs. They are very powerful. If you don’t aim at their weakness well, you won’t be able to injure them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Orcs are easy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Orcs, goblins, kobolds!&nbsp;</span><span style="">These three species represented easy monsters in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were monsters for level 10~40 users to hunt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid knew this, so he ignored Khan’s advice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I need to prepare winter clothes for the cold.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid equipped the hammer that he had made.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Unknown Blacksmith’s Hammer]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 350/350 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 70~80&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Odds of Making a Rare Rated Item: +17%&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Odds of Making an Unique Rated Item: +7%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A blacksmith’s hammer made by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but his experience and reputation is somewhat lacking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This is a hammer produced by the craftsman himself, so it isn’t suitable for other blacksmiths to use.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Conditions of Use: Pagma’s Descendant</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 80&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was confident. It was unlikely for him to create a normal rated item with this hammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I should at least make a rare rated item. In addition, a lot of epic items will come out.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was full of confidence as he asked Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"How do I make armor with excellent cold resistance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If you use giant brown bear leather...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That day.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan taught Grid how to make giant brown bear leather armor and he spent 20 hours making it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And the next morning!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid finished the armor with a level limit of 130, and the information popped up in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Warm Giant Brown Bear Leather Armor]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Normal</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 200/200 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 143</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Cold resistance will increase by 15%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A giant brown bear leather armor made by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but his experience and reputation is somewhat lacking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The wearer will be able to feel warm even in winter. It has enough defense to protect the wearer from sharp weapons. However, it is vulnerable to blunt instruments.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 130 or higher. Intermediate Leather Armor Mastery.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 300</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was frustrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Norma... normal? This is crazy! Nonsense!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He invested 20 hours in production time and used the finest quality bear leather. In addition, he had the hammer that increased the odds of making an epic item.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Nevertheless, he still made a normal item. How unlucky was he?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is manipulation... Clearly... The manipulation of those scummy operators!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was the only legendary blacksmith among two billion users, so why could he only make normal items? It was a phenomenon that couldn’t be understood!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid wanted to log out right now and go to S.A Group’s headquarters. Then he would shout until the president emerged.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"... If I have the guts to do that, I would’ve done it sooner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Every time he made an item, he expected it to be finished with a high rating., However, most of the items had a normal rating and he was always disappointed. Therefore, he was already used to being disappointed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s why Grid quickly calmed himself and started making gloves, boots, a cloak and a hat using the giant brown bear leather.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unlike armor, the gloves, boots, cloak and hat required less detail, so the time required to make them wasn’t very long, even when he used his maximum effort.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Warm Giant Brown Bear Leather Hat]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Normal</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 65/65 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 19</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Cold resistance will increase by 5%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A giant brown bear leather hat made by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but his experience and reputation is somewhat lacking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The wearer will be warm even in the dead of winter. Don’t expect a defense effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Conditions of Use: &nbsp;Level 130 or more.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 50&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Warm Giant Brown Bear Leather Cloak]</span></p>

 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 130 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 100&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Warm and Functional Giant Brown Bear Leather Gloves]</span></p>

 <p><span style="">Durability: 110/110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 50</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Cold resistance will increase by 15%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Giant brown bear leather gloves made by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but his experience and reputation is somewhat lacking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It has an excellent effect in cold weather, to the extent that the wearer can feel their fingers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Even though the gloves are made of thick leather, it feels very comfortable when gripping things.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 130 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 50</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Great Giant Brown Bear Boots]&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 130 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 80&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were two normal items, one rare and one epic. Grid managed to appease himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This performance isn’t bad. Should I put it on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Due to your class characteristics, you have equipped the Warm Giant Brown Bear Leather Armor.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[This is an item you created. Your understanding is 100%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[In the case of items made by you, a penalty will be applied if you don’t meet the item usage requirements, even if you have full understanding.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The defense of Warm Giant Brown Bear Leather Armor has been reduced by 5%. Only half of the option effects will be applied.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Due to your class characteristics, you have equipped the Warm Giant Brown Bear Leather Hat.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[This is an item you created. Your understanding is 100%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[In the case of items made by you, a penalty will be applied if you don’t meet the item usage requirements, even if you have full understanding.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The defense of Warm Giant Brown Bear Leather Hat has been reduced by 5%. Only half of the option effects will be applied.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Due to your class characteristics, you have equipped the Warm Giant Brown Bear Leather Cloak.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[This is an item you created. Your understanding is 100%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[In the case of items made by you, a penalty will be applied if you don’t meet the item usage requirements, even if you have full understanding.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The defense of Warm Giant Brown Bear Leather Cloak has been reduced by 5%. Only half of the option effects will be applied.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid already knew that a penalty would be applied if he didn’t meet the item usage conditions, even if he had full understanding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s like the Ideal Dagger. The Ideal Dagger with a unique rating has a 20% penalty, while a normal rated item has a 5% penalty. Then what about a rare and epic rating?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid immediately equipped the gloves and boots.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Due to your class characteristics, you have equipped the Warm and Functional Giant Brown Bear Leather Gloves.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[This is an item you created. Your understanding is 100%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[In the case of items made by you, a penalty will be applied if you don’t meet the item usage requirements, even if you have full understanding.]</span></p>

 <p><span style="">[The defense of Great Giant Brown Bear Boots has been reduced by 15%. Only half of the option effects will be applied.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Rare rating is 10% and epic rating is 15%...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid muttered when an unexpected notification window popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have equipped the ‘Giant Brown Bear Leather Set,’ giving a bonus of 60 defense and 30% cold resistance.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh? Khan, are these set items?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“It isn’t classified as a set item when I make it. But it is classified as a set item when you make it. Isn’t it because you designed the balance of items perfectly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"... I just made it according to the production method.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the moment when the power of Pagma’s Descendant was exerted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was happy. The value of set items was far higher than normal items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Set items...! This is another means of making money. Okay, shall I go now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s body was covered with reddish-brown fur as he headed for the snowy north.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At this time, he still didn’t know. The frostlight orcs were much stronger than he thought. In addition, the probability that the frostlight orcs would drop the sylphid scales was only around 1%!</span></p>
