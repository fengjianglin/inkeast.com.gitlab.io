 <p><span style="">Chapter 226</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">White Transformation referred to the technique of borrowing the goddess’ power stored in the three divine artifacts of the Rebecca Church.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a technique that allowed a person to borrow power that exceeded the human body. However, this power placed a heavy burden on the body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rebecca’s Daughters refrained from using White Transformation as much as possible, and shortened the duration when they inevitably had to use it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Isabel had been in the White Transformation state for the past year.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was because Grid unsealed Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her life energy was rapidly becoming depleted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cough! Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Her platinum hair had turned grey.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her shining eyes were faded like she was dead, and her normally flushed cheeks were pale.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Nevertheless, she still looked beautiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Right now she is only 18 years old...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She was about to die at this age.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian looked at Isabel out of habit and finally started crying.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“How many times have I told you? I said that Lifael’s Spear must be sealed! Then why... Why aren’t you listening to me? Huh...? Isabel-chan, are the orders so important? More than your life?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cough! Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Isabel lying in bed didn’t answer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was staring at the distant sky out the window and her hearing had long been lost. She didn’t even hear Damian’s voice shouting right beside her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Isabel-chan...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian’s handsome face twisted. His face was streaked with tears and a runny nose, so someone laughed at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why are you empathizing with tools?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was Pascal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He entered Isabel’s room without knocking, causing Damian to tremble.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You...! How many times have I warned you not to describe them as tools?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian hated Pascal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 5th Pope Franz felt a moment of compassion and sealed the divine artifacts of the church, leading to the weakening of the church. This was the logic used to convince the church that Lifael’s Spear shouldn’t be sealed again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The person who spoke it was Pascal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal just shrugged.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Rebecca’s Daughters are fostered to serve this church in exchange for their lives. Don’t get caught up in useless sympathy and think about what is needed to keep the church. You are just damaging yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As his descendant, Pascal respected 5th Pope Franz. However, he couldn’t understand all of Franz’ policies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From the beginning, weren’t Rebecca’s Daughters people brought up as tools?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sealing the power of the divine artifacts just because they couldn’t endure it?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was preposterous.&nbsp;</span><span style="">An ignorant mistake.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pascal and most of the senior priests of the Rebecca Church thought this way.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They planned to contact Pagma’s Descendant so that he could release the seals of the two remaining artifacts as soon as possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Damian couldn’t tolerate it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will never accept it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rebecca’s paladins were much weaker than the Judar and Dominion paladins, so it wasn’t a popular class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Damian walked this path to the end without giving up just because of Rebecca’s Daughters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Isabel, Rin, Luna.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian longed for these three girls to always be happy. He wished for them to smile forever. He couldn’t stand them suffering.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"They are people like us. And they have worked harder for this church than anyone else. To disparage them and call them mere tools... Goddess Rebecca won’t forgive it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You dare mention Goddess Rebecca? You are deceived by the beautiful appearance of the tools and lost control. Stupid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal laughed at Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was similar to those who ridiculed Damian in reality for running a fancafe of Rebecca’s Daughters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian couldn’t understand them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"...Why do you have to ridicule someone’s love and respect?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The problem is that the target is a tool, not a person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Isn’t this just like people in reality saying that Rebecca’s Daughters are NPCs, not humans...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Reality? NPC? I can’t understand the language you are using.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Shut up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal was the former leader of the Judar Church and a pope candidate, so he had mighty divine power. Rebecca’s Daughters were the only ones in the church with higher divine power than him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"They are people too! They rejoice in every moment! They are impressed! Angry! Sad! They are the same as us! Not tools or NPCs! Don’t compare them to such things!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The divine power that Damian emitted was threatening. It was a threat to Pascal, who was likely to become the pope after Drevigo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is the power of the Goddess' Agent...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal had always ignored Damian, who usually chased after Rebecca’s Daughters.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had laughed when he heard some priests talk about trying to put Damian as pope, but now he was wary of Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The upset Damian proclaimed to him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I will change everything! I will root out all the rotten people, including you, who treat Rebecca’s Daughters as sub-human beings! For Isabel-chan and Rin-chan! And for the sake of Luna-chan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian accepted the quest that he put on hold.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I...! I will become the pope!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The quest ‘Become the Pope’ has been accepted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Become the Pope]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Difficulty Level: SS</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It has been one year since the death of 13th Pope Drevigo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Rebecca Church has barely recovered from the confusion and is now preparing to elect a new pope.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Pascal is now the most powerful pope candidate and he plans to use the Rebecca Church as a political tool.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As the agent of the goddess, you have an obligation to guide the Rebecca Church to the right path and to stop Pascal’s ambitions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Your power, beliefs and willpower will play a major role in defeating irrational violence and calming political strife.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After your crowning, you can never disobey Goddess Rebecca.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The faithful church members will cheer for you.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Conditions: In three months, become the pope in the pope’s election.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Rewards: Second class ‘Pope’ will be obtained. ‘Goddess Rebecca’s Armor,’ ‘Goddess Rebecca’s Helmet,’ and ‘Goddess Rebecca’s Gloves’ will be acquired.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Failure: Pascal will become the pope. The Rebecca Church will decline even worse than the days of Drevigo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You will become the pope?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal was angry.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He’d already bought more than half of the votes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This declaration had no foundation to succeed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Well, good. As the Goddess' Agent, you are qualified to be a pope candidate. I respect you.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Thump thump.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal nodded before heading over to Isabel’s bed. Isabel looked at him and he gave her an order.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A Yatan Temple was found in Kent Village on the outskirts of the empire. Show them the divine power of the spear. Ah, can you hear me? This is the command. Read this and act accordingly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The user of Lifael’s Spear always had White Transformation triggered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Naturally, the work had to be done fast, so the elders assigned Isabel more duties than the other two Rebecca’s Daughters.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a result, Isabel's life energy was depleting more quickly, but the elders didn’t care.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were already preparing substitutes in large quantities.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will go.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian intercepted the command.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I will take on all the duties that she will perform in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal rejected it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Didn’t I say it before? Are you making fun of the elders’ commands? As you know, the pope’s seat is currently empty so they are working on his behalf. Violating their orders is like going against the pope...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I am the Goddess' Agent.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian responded strongly to Pascal, who tried to repeat an explanation that Damian had heard several times already.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"As you said, the elders aren’t the pope.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I don’t want to hear anymore about the elders’ orders. Only the true pope and Goddess Rebecca can command me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian’s words sounded good, but he had a weak base. The senior priests didn’t treat Damian as important and ignored his opinions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now Damian made his position clear, so Pascal couldn’t help feeling dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hrmm...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal tried to think.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If this guy is busy on the battlefield, he will be less likely to win the pope’s election held in three months.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian wasn’t competition in the first place, but it would be a good idea to clear the path.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal nodded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Go ahead. But I doubt that you will be able to perform the difficult missions with your abilities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I am strong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had a unique hidden class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now Damian was different from the past.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was no longer the extra who just watched while Grid fought Drevigo.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian was also a protagonist.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kukuk, good. Prepare your heart. If you become tired and fall down, Isabel will take on the missions again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then Pascal left the room.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian cursed him and planned for the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'The mission is in the east of the empire. It is relatively close to the western part of the Eternal Kingdom.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Reidan was located in the west of the Eternal Kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘I will stop by to meet him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The person who went against Pope Drevigo and saved Rebecca’s Daughters.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He helped Damian become the Goddess' Agent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Also...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The only one who can seal Lifael’s Spear.'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pagma’s Descendant, Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was the only person Damian could rely on.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Damian...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Isabel called out to Damian who was about to leave.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian took a deep breath. His expression that was distorted with rage gradually softened to a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I am going, Isabel-chan. Please stay well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian said goodbye to her with a smile.</span></p>
