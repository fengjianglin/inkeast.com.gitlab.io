 <p><span style="">Chapter 268</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">But something was looking at him from the shadows.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Twitch, twitch.</span></i> <i><span style="">Twitch, twitch.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">His small, chubby butt shook from side to side. The short paws were completely pressed against the floor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The best demonic beast of hell was moving secretly to catch his prey.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is a scientific, beautiful and perfectly designed hunting posture! Nyang!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Crow was unable to perceive Noe’s presence in the darkness.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a good assassin, but it wasn’t at the level of sensing the best demonic beast of hell.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Suuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Crow climbed towards the landing of the third floor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The third floor was where Isabel’s room was located.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Soon.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Crow imagined it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Stabbing Grid with his dagger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kyong!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe jumped towards Crow. The sharp and small fangs gleamed in the darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Crow was confused.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He never thought the day would come when he was surprised by a cat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I didn’t notice a cat following me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the biggest shame and embarrassment he’d experienced since he was born.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was only for a moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He quickly regained his composure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Crow was a professional.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had survived many crises and assassinated 89 humans.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the process, he realized something.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was that he must remain calm under any circumstances.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Crow’s experience meant he didn’t make a fuss about the surprise appearance of a cat.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Paang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Crow blocked the cat’s paw swiping at him with his dagger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Crow hesitated as he was about to counterattack.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Snap.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">He couldn’t properly move his wrist after the blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why is this cat so strong?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This wasn’t a normal cat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Crow noticed Noe’s peculiarities.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were small horns on the forehead and short wings on the back.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A high class demonic beast.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘How is this demonic beast here?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This place was the Vatican.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Vatican was filled with divine power. Monsters couldn’t come near the Vatican. A monster that took one step inside the Vatican would die from the divine power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That was the problem.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Currently, Noe couldn’t exercise his skills properly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s serious.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe’s master had ordered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Be prepared for any enemy while Master was concentrating. If an enemy invades, don’t hesitate to hurry to Grid and tell him the news.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the problem was...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I unconsciously moved.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe recognized himself as a rational being, but reality was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Noe was still young and faithful to his instincts.&nbsp;</span><span style="">When a dark man showed up and moved quietly through the darkness, he instinctively attacked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was unintentionally done and the current situation was the result.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe was affected.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t gather any strength in his body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The divine power of the Rebecca Church’s Vatican was terrible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But how could the best demonic beast of hell lose to a human?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Nyaang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe once again swung his paws.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chukak.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Sharp claws tore at Crow’s ears.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Crow felt a chill as he barely managed to escape a deadly blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Fast...! A high class demonic beast!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The cat was clearly a demonic beast.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It might not look like it, but it must be a huge monster.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Maybe it had the skills of an intermediate level demonkin.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If not, it wouldn’t have been able to move inside the Vatican that was filled with divine power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I need to take it seriously.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reason why a demonic beast was here didn’t matter.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was just one more target to kill.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Clink.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Crow, who had been fighting with only one dagger, pulled out a short sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A dagger in his right hand and a short sword in his left hand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His attitude changed after he grabbed another weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the appearance of the famous Crow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kiyong!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No strength.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Crow defended against Noe’s scratches with his short sword. He drew his short sword in a diagonal line. Then he stabbed with his dagger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A light wound appeared on Noe’s chest. The sword sword was cut slightly and the dagger was avoided.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Crow’s expression twisted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It avoided it?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe bared his fangs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Nyaang!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjeejeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe’s claws became faster and stronger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Crow found it difficult to avoid, and he tried to defend by crossing his short sword and dagger. Then he realized Noe’s real power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A senior demonkin!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was this possible?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Weren’t demonic beasts originally subordinates of the demonkin?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Crow was shocked and pulled out the trump card he had been saving.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The walls, the floor and the shadows on the ceiling started to shake.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A shadow technique was activated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe’s eyes widened with surprise at the strange sensation, while Crow smiled with satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Go to hell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Crow was convinced of his victory and opened his mouth for the first time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At the same time, the shadows on all four sides moved and changed their shape into that of a thorn.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pa pa pa pat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Six thorns flew from different orbits and pierced Noe’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Noe determined it was dangerous and used Fluidization.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Fluidization]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a skill that made it impossible for physical damage to impact his body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Noe couldn’t use it properly due to the influence of divine power. He couldn’t use Soul Ingestion at all.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, Fluidization didn’t work and Noe received damage.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"What, nyang?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One of the six thorns penetrated Noe’s small body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Noe let out a pained scream and fell to the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is unfair, nyang.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The biggest problem was that Noe couldn’t use the Soul Ingestion skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Noe hated the Vatican.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Crow trampled on Noe’s protruding belly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Noe’s snout gaped open. Then a pained sound emerged.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Crow laughed at him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"This is the end of the demonic beast.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Clink.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Crow aimed at Noe’s face with the short sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s up to here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Suddenly, a voice was heard.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The surprised Crow hurriedly turned his head, but no one could see it. There were just darkness all over the place.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A hallucination?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had no choice but to feel doubts. There were no signs of anyone. It was a stealth ability beyond human limits.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Crow’s eyes twitched as he felt something.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was losing control of the shadows.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The shadows rose like a wave.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Crow tried to avoid it, but it was impossible. The speed of the shadows was too fast.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Crow’s body was pressured by the shadows.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Crow turned pale was he was caught by the shadows and thrown into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The speed of the shadow control is ridiculously fast...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The shadow technique could evolve to this extent?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t believe it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">While Crow was feeling confusion, the shadows kept tightening around his body. Crow struggled but the pain just got worse.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Who on earth could so easily overpower him?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Crow’s questions were deepening when a man appeared from the darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Y-You...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a man with black skin. His body was very dry and his arms were abnormally long.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was only one person who came to mind once all these things were summed up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Crow screamed,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Kasim!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Someone who could control shadows beyond mere attacking and defending.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was able to make soldiers from shadows.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The assassin who led an army.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His nickname...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“King of Shadows!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why was that monster here?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Crow had more questions. But the answer that came to him was death.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The shadows pressed on him more strongly and he couldn’t even scream as he died.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kasim removed Crow’s body so there were no traces left. The shadows swept over the area and even the bloodstains disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The more I look, the cuter it is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kasim looked at Noe, who was unconscious, and disappeared into the shadows.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chirp!</span></i> <i><span style="">Tweet!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Birds made noises.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Warm sunshine wrapped around his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Nya.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe woke up from his serene sleep. Then he looked to the left and right.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok! What is going on? Kyak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">When it was dawn.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had been fighting a savage human. Then he was hit by a lousy technique and got knocked out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Noe thought up to here and found it ridiculous.&nbsp;</span><span style="">How could the best demonic beast of hell by beaten by a human?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It's a disgrace! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was unacceptable, even if the location was the Vatican.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why should this great body, that could overcome humanity with its paws, suffer from such indignity?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Noe trembled with anger and belatedly questioned it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why am I alive? Nyang?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If he was knocked out by a human, wouldn’t he be killed?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Noe pondered it and concluded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It was a dream! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What happened last night wasn’t real.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Nyahahat! That is it! How can the best demonic beast of hell be beaten by a human? Nyahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe was sure of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In fact, he had no choice but to think that way.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Otherwise, how could Noe explain why he was still alive?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Due to his tremendous resilience, the wounds he had the day before were completely gone, so Noe’s thoughts were justified.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttiring~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe's status changed from frustration to self-gratification.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid had no interest in Noe. He was too busy with Lifael’s Spear and didn’t see the pet window at all.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I’m screwed.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was feeling nervous.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had observed Lifael’s Spear, but despite two days passing, he couldn’t figure out a way to seal it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Was I thinking too easily?’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Had he let his recent victories get to him?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can’t understand what’s connecting the parts of the spear.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The bonding area was too clean. Grid wasn’t even sure what techniques were used.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s impossible to do this with forging alone. However, it isn’t one whole item...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If he disassembled and assembled the spear, he could uncover the secrets behind how the two parts were joined. But he couldn’t do that because of Isabel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid continued to observe the spear while logically grasping its structure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The next day, an uninvited guest came.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Pascal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I want to give you a present.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal extended a box containing one million gold.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was almost twice as much as Damian’s 530,000 gold. It was 1.2 billion won in cash.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Would you like to receive Pascal’s gift?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[If you receive the gift, you must unconditionally accept one of Pascal’s requests.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Are you kidding me? This is the extent of your gift? Get lost.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid wasn’t simple enough to cling to simple profits anymore. He was always looking ahead.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wouldn’t allow the empire to swallow the Rebecca Church just for one million gold.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Two more days passed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid drove away Pascal and decided to change his viewpoint while observing Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Maybe the secret isn’t in the technique but the materials?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The main ingredient of Lifael’s Spear was adamantium.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Adamantium was a silver material but the color of the combined area was blue.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No minerals were used other than adamantium. It seems like the adamantium is mixed with something else.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was clearly something.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This... perhaps?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that moment, something passed through Grid’s head.</span></p>
