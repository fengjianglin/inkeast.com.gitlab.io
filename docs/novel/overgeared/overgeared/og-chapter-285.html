 <p><span style="">Chapter 285</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">A pleasant breeze blew over the grass.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A young couple was sitting next to each other under a big tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid and Irene.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Dear husband. Heheh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There seemed to be hearts around them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Irene was reunited with Grid after six months, so she was the happiest person in the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This moment seems so unreal. I don’t want this dream to end.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Irene’s smile couldn’t be erased. She had already overcome the depression she had been suffering from.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The more she rejoiced, the more pained Grid became. He felt sorry that he made her so lonely.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I want to take her to Reidan.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was his original desire.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">But unfortunately, Irene couldn’t leave Winston.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I love you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I love you too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Their love deepened in proportion to the amount of time they missed each other.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The two people felt like this time was more precious than ever as they hugged each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I’m happy about this system.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The parenting system.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was a child in Irene’s belly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid pressed his face to Irene’s swollen belly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Duguen.</span></i> <i><span style="">Duguen.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The sound of the fetus’ heartbeat reached his ears. It was a small but energetic sound.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid felt the infinite mysteries.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘My child...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He would be a father.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He felt fear since it was his first experience, but his happiness was greater.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It felt like he had left his trace in this world. Words couldn’t describe the sense of fulfillment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I was lonely until last year and never thought this day would come.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Money, colleagues, friends. A woman he loved and now a home.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had obtained all these things from Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Satisfy wasn’t just a game, but a world that was as precious as reality.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Irene’s small hand grabbed Grid’s big and rough hands.&nbsp;</span>She felt a desire that she expressed.</p>
 <p><span style="">“I want our child to be a boy with nice hands like yours. Do you want that as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Eternal Kingdom’s treatment of women wasn’t as bad as the south. Compared with other kingdoms, the social status of women was very high.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was an undeniable reality that most nobles wanted a male heir.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">For Irene, she was Marquis Steim’s only daughter, so she was well aware of this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Marquis Steim had actually wanted a son.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Irene wanted to have a son, but she couldn’t help feeling a little bitter from her position as a woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s high insight read her mind and he answered quickly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I’d like a daughter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Isn’t a daughter lacking in many ways to be &nbsp;the heir?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No, such things don’t matter. I just want a daughter who is as beautiful and kind as you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Love wasn’t a skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid were merely telling the truth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Irene was thrilled by his unexpected answer. Her eyes filled with tears and she blushed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dear husband is so good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The moist eyes and flushed cheeks were adorable.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This stimulus caused Grid to gulp.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Irene could see what he wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I love you. It is hard with the child in my belly but...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh... H-Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Irene was still a girl. She had a purity that made it seem like she hadn’t known a man yet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, Grid was embarrassed by the meaningful remark she made that didn’t match her appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Now, let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-Wait a minute.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There is no need for time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Irene led Grid to her bedroom.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After that.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The two people shared their love in a different way due to Irene’s pregnancy, and the result was good.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The child in the belly has felt the couple’s true love.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[All stats of the child in the belly will permanently increase by one.]</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">A whisper came from Lauel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After 10 days, he intended to hold a merger ceremony with the Silver Knights Guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I guess I have to leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had spent three happy days with Irene.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wanted to stay near Irene, but he couldn’t enjoy it forever.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He knew the responsibility as the Overgeared master had to be fulfilled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If I have my kingdom, I won’t see anyone else and will place you as my queen.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was one more reason to become king.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Phoenix approached Grid as he prepared to leave.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Duke Grid, can’t you take Lady Irene with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Take Irene to Reidan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes, My Lord. That is Marquis Steim’s wish.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She would give birth in 4 months.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Marquis Steim didn’t want her to be lonely in the meantime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the same with Grid, but wasn’t Irene ruler of Winston?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Can she leave this place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Marquis Steim has sent a substitute.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That is good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid smiled widely.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Phoenix was in tears as he saw Grid’s delight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘My Lady, you are truly loved.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hold on tightly to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid hugged Irene and flew with Braham’s Boots.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The sight of the two people in the clouds was reminiscent of a scene in a romantic movie.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It is too mysterious and exciting. It’s like a fairy tale world.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I think every moment with you is a fairy tale.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Dear husband...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The child in the belly has felt the couple’s true love.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[All stats of the child in the belly will permanently increase by one.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The child in the belly has witnessed the marvels of nature.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The child in the belly is curious.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The intelligence of child in the belly will permanently increase by two.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"My mana is low. Let's walk for a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Huhut, I remember walking through the forest with you on the day we met.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the past, Grid had rescued Irene from Malacus and they headed through the forest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He recalled that time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid wrapped an arm around Irene’s slender shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Danger won’t come to you again. I will protect you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Dear husband...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The child in the belly has felt the couple’s true love.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[All stats of the child in the belly will permanently increase by one.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The couple’s liking grew exponentially during the journey to Reidan and had a good effect on the child.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Monsters and thieves appeared occasionally to threaten the couple, but they were just experience to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The child in the belly has witnessed his father’s sword dance and admires it.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The child in the belly is interested in swordsmanship.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The strength of child in the belly will permanently increase by one.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The child in the belly has witnessed his father’s weapon repairing and admires it.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The child in the belly is interested in blacksmithing.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The dexterity of child in the belly will permanently increase by one.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Every so often, these notification windows would pop up in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'This is like a joke.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level 1 characters had a total of 22 stat points..&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, it seemed like the baby would have at least 50 stat points from the moment they were born.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Well, the important thing is the maximum limit of the stats.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t expect much from the stats of his child.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because NPCs had a limit on their stats, except for named NPCs. He just hoped for a nice and pretty child who resembled Irene.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was forgetting.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the fact that his child was a special person who inherited the blood of the legendary Grid and Marquis Steim of the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Guild Name: Overgeared</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level: 10 (MAX)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Master: Grid</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Capacity: 28/250</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Affiliation: The Eternal Kingdom</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Alliances: Marquis Steim</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hostile Relationships: There are no forces that can be called clear enemies, but there are many who are on guard.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Inclination: An unconditionally favorable relationship with Marquis Steim.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Territory: Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Originally, raising the level of a guild was very tough.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It took the top guilds at least a year to reach level 10.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Overgeared was a special case.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Due to the huge rewards from the golem invasion, they were able to achieve level 10 in just 7 months.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid wasn’t satisfied.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why is there only 250 guild members? This guild system is completely bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Silver Knights Guild had a total of exactly 225 members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The conditions of the merger included all of them, so Grid was puzzled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel explained.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"You can make another guild.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"One person can make multiple guilds?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No. Someone in Overgeared should create a new guild and assign that guild to Overgeared. In other words, it is a second guild.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ah, this is how the guilds with more than 250 members operate?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel’s eyes became weary.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid didn’t even know this basic system.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, well. Create a new guild.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I'm still lacking.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel pointed to Jishuka.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Jishuka was the master of the Tzedakah Guild, which is like the mother of Overgeared. She can lead a second guild well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes, yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had absolute trust in Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He believed he would succeed if he followed Lauel’s advice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Jishuka refused to become the master of the second guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She already had enough responsibility as ruler of Bairan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel reassured her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Over the past six months, the Overgeared members have been learning how to manage a territory. There are many people who can handle Bairan on your behalf, so don’t worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Then it’s okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members gathered together and Jishuka formed a new guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What will the guild name be?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was up to the guild master to pick a name.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka and the Overgeared members focused on Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid thought about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Overgeared Two.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah, really!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel cried out angrily, but the Overgeared members didn’t show any signs of rejection.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had already adapted to Grid’s naming sense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, Lauel was desperate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The second and third guilds are usually named according to their role! The second guild will be filled with secondary classes, so you should name it according to its characteristics!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Workforce?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sigh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the end, it was determined that the second guild would be called Overgeared Two.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The day of the guild merger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 225 members of the Silver Knights Guild, including Peak Sword, arrived in Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to the power of the 15th ranked Peak Sword, the monsters in the desert couldn’t stop them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Silver Knights Guild were overwhelmed by Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Reidan’s development was increasing by leaps and bounds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a big city with all types of buildings, and the soldiers were well armed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, the alchemy facilities and agricultural fields couldn’t be compared to other cities.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the power of the 20 million gold that Grid invested.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Welcome to Reidan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A black haired man appeared among the soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were almost 30 members of Overgeared following him, all of whom were rankers or famous.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword and the Silver Knights Guild trembled at the thought that they would soon be one group.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Master, I look forward to working with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword knew how to distinguish between public and private.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He might be older than Grid in reality, but he knew his status was far below Grid’s in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This attitude would help establish the discipline in the newly expanded Overgeared Guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I am as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the moment when the man who was ignored by the neighborhood children was reborn as the leader of a huge guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If a documentary was made of Grid, this would be a featured scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was this the life that Grid would walk from now on?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, it still wasn’t smooth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Right now, the minerals detector Minor was hurriedly heading towards him.</span></p>
