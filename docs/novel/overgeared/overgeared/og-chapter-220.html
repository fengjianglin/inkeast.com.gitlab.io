 <p><span style="">Chapter 220</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The central spire of Reidan Castle was a huge 11 stories. It was nearly twice as high as the spire of the lord’s castle in common cities.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is the height of the central spire important?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"In a sense, it symbolizes the power of the lord. The greater the prestige and power of the lord, the higher the height of the spires.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"In other words, the former lord of Reidan enjoyed the same authority as the king.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That is the correct interpretation."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In fact, the size of Reidan Castle was comparable to the king’s palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The castle has a total of 127 rooms. In addition, there are six other outbuildings. There are five gardens, three parade grounds, and a barracks that can accommodate 8,000 troops.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were no small decorations or basic furniture left. It was left untouched for a long time, so there were many rusty places and it was desolate.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the form itself was completely preserved, so Grid was amazed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s surprising. I thought the castle would be completely ruined like the city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The people of Reidan sacrificed themselves to protect it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The days when the empire defended the Hebend River.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The people of Reidan had to give a certain amount as tribute to the empire, and it came to the point where they had to dismantle the city’s buildings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, they couldn’t touch the castle, which was the symbol of Reiden, and their last remaining pride. As a result, the entire scenery around Reidan Castle was a ruin.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was deeply impressed by Lauel’s explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The people of Reidan might be dying of starvation, but they protected their pride...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was a selfish person, but at least he had patriotism. It was the result of the forceful education during military service.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to that, he was able to understand the hearts of the Reidan people without laughing at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The people really love the place where they grew up.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had a positive observation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It will be a big help to me to save the people of Reidan. Then the people of Reidan will be loyal and follow any orders. Isn’t that right? Lauel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel was impressed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I can't believe you thought that deeply.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Anyone could think about it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he thought that Grid couldn’t.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid spoke to the astonished Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Don’t exploit the people or give unreasonable commands.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel was shocked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was more surprised than when he observed the unique rated rake several hours ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What’s wrong?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Wasn’t Grid the type of person to use others for his own sake?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was unbelievable to Lauel that he would make such a statement about the people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was at a loss when Grid whispered to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I am the lord of the people, so I can’t act childish. Just do it properly.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The people were the cash flow. Grid still thought so.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wanted to do the minimum amount to protect them. This was the least he could do for the people who sacrificed themselves to protect the symbol of the lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“In the first place, people must live here. Isn't that right?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was the lord of Reidan and leader of the Overgeared Guild, so he decided to act in a manner that wouldn’t shame them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now he was trying to act according to that determination.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel smiled with satisfaction at Grid’s growth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will keep it in mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid went ahead. After a few hours, he grasped the structure of the castle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s really big. This great castle is mine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It isn’t just this castle. You’re the master of everything in Reidan. In addition, you’re eligible to get your hands on something greater. The spires of Reidan will become higher than the royal palace.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Huroi remarked as he appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Welcome Huroi. Your words always make me feel better. Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thank you?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Huroi was baffled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The original Grid wasn’t someone who would express appreciation for anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Reciprocating the goodwill of others...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The selfish Grid was starting to fill up his lacking spots.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was gratifying. He noticed things that weren’t pointed out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He grows every time I see him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi and Lauel were impressed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Thump thump.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid moved to the great hall that could accommodate around 500 people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Apart from the old throne, it was just a room full of dust.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid didn’t doubt that this would soon shine a brilliant gold.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He sat on the throne and quietly closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Now it feels real.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was a duke of the Eternal Kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Next to the king, he had the highest status and held the greatest power in his hand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He represented Huroi, Lauel, Jishuka and the other Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Am I qualified?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Many memories went through Grid’s mind.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At a young age, he learned to be anxious around others.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As an adolescent, he had many limitations.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In his 20’s, he experienced a lot of frustration.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hardships came to mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His memories before Satisfy were the worst.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But everything changed after he started Satisfy and became Pagma’s Descendant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He used the abilities he obtained to overcome his limitations, as well as the trials that he received.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is this purely the result of good luck?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid wondered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After a long moment of thinking, he came up with an answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a lot of luck, but in the end, it was his own strength and efforts that led to this result.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was unclear if the Northern End Cave even existed, but he had found it after several months of exploration.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I am qualified. I was able to climb up to this point because I’m qualified.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Sururuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was filled with joyful emotions and slowly opened his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was this the influence of his higher charm stat? Or was it the effect of the true pride that he realized at this moment?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s eyes were deeper than ever, like the sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huroi, Lauel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid called out and Huroi bowed with a sincere heart. Lauel followed as well. The two of them prostrated before him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a common action.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid didn’t feel awkward because of their exaggerated behavior.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Both of you said that I’m destined to be the best. Was that false or exaggerated?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi and Lauel responded in unshakable voices.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"My Lord is already the best.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You are the only person I acknowledge. So you are a qualified person."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were sincere.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s power, stats and abilities were among the top out of the two billion users in Satisfy. The only flaw was that he was lacing financial power, but he could overcome it if Reidan developed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Defects in personality and intelligence?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was developing, so that wasn’t a problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Yes, I will believe you and take pride in myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At this moment, Grid developed some self-pride.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was pure pride, not arrogance or egotism.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sigh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He let out a deep exhale.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The victim mentality and inferiority complex was deeply rooted because of his experiences in the past. He hadn’t fully shed it yet, but this was the moment his heart cleared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His jealousy towards others disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">His heart was light.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His head became clear and his vision widened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This feels much better.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid said with a bright smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now he was reaching the end of his steady internal growth process.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Reidan was a very large city that could accommodate 430,000 people, but it was currently impossible to increase the population.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because Reidan didn’t have any charms to attract people from other parts of the world to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel believed that they should make good use of the 20,551 people currently living in Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“We have addressed the food shortage. The pace of the farmland clearing has increased exponentially thanks to the discovery of water by Piaro, the legendary farmer and feng shui expert. It’s easy to spread drinking water.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Legendary farmer? Feng shui expert?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid and the Overgeared members were in the meeting room.&nbsp;</span><span style="">How did Piaro become a legendary farmer and feng shui expert?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid questioned this while Lauel laid out policies for the future.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Developing agriculture would encourage the birth of the people, promote consumption and attract external resources.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In addition, there was a plan to grow the smithy on a large scale, centering on Grid and Khan. This would build up a foothold to become a commercial city.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“At this time, the role of the Overgeared members is to subjugate the monsters. We need to reduce the power of the monsters occupying the west. In particular, the ultimate goal is to destroy all the giant worms.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As with most online games, Satisfy’s monsters respawned after a certain period of time from their deaths.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But monsters that caused certain episodes, such as the giant worms, were in the special category.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"There is probably the home of the giant worms somewhere underground. If we find and destroy it, I’m sure that the giant worms will no longer respawn.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The giant worms had to be destroyed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the west could develop and the episode would move to the next stage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel’s words stirred the enthusiasm of the Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Levels are guaranteed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes. The monsters in the west give a lot of experience.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"In return, they are too strong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“We have the power of our items. Have you forgotten? We fortunately have Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Lauel, are there no longer any villages or cities in the west where people live? If it’s possible to find a place where people are still living, can’t we bring them to Reidan to increase the population?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the opinion of Toban, the former chief of staff of the Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members responded positively to his words, but Lauel expressed concern.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"For the time being, I don’t plan to search for other villages or cities. We should ignore the cities and villages found in the middle of the desert. There is likely to be a vampire lair.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vampires had a minimum level of 250. However, this was the case of the young vampires. Vampires who lived for over 300 years were likely to have levels over 400.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The possibility of being wiped out was high if they stepped into a vampire lair, so Lauel wanted to avoid such a situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid rose from his seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’ll go now. There’s a mountain of work piled up in the smithy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s word was far from being a lord. In fact, Lauel was taking the role of the lord while Grid acted like a blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At first glance, the situations should be reversed, but this was actually right.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid wasn’t smart enough to lead a big city. It was Grid himself who appointed Lauel to this role.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After that.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members were able to level up and secure resources by hunting the monsters. The desertification of Reidan meant that timber was lacking, so securing timber was the first priority.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro and Bland immersed themselves in farming with the people, while Jude was tasked with training the strong people who Grid discovered through the Great Lord's Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Jump. Roll. Gear up. Spear...? Stab and swing your spear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jude’s reckless training caused many soldiers to leave. However, a handful endured and were gradually reborn into elite soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, their Weapons Mastery skill didn’t grow, but the speed of their strength and stamina rise was abnormally fast.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Anyway, my soldiers don’t need a high Weapons Mastery skill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid made weapons with low usage conditions and high attack power and spread them to the soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even the farm equipment was powerful, so the soldiers armed with his items were different from other soldiers in the region.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid worked in the smithy around the clock.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was now working on construction tools instead of farming tools.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Agriculture was stable now, so they were focusing on constructing facilities with the resources secured by the Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I feel like I’m dying, but my persistence and dexterity stats are rapidly growing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid wasn’t bored.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Obtaining a different outcome every time from his production work was a different type of fun from hunting and boss raids.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In any case, he was a blacksmith and needed to do it for the rest of his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Irene will like it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His dexterity stat kept rising, so he would be able to make Irene even happier.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid laughed while thinking about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, Khan was busy nurturing young blacksmiths.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hey! That forging quality isn’t great! Hey! If you put the firewood in now, your control of the fire will fall!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan’s voice seemed to become more vigorous as the days passed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan’s passion made Grid smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then after a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s been a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit finally arrived.</span></p>
