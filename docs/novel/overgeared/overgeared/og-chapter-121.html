 <p><span style="">Chapter 121</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style=""> “You brought a big shot here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Shay rebuked Dong Pao.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was true that the higher level the target, the higher the ransom value. However, there was a line.&nbsp;An opponent that was too strong wasn’t welcomed, because there was a possibility that their threats wouldn’t work and the situation would reverse.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dong Pao thought it was unfair.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“The butcher’s face and ID weren’t revealed.&nbsp;How could I know that he would be the butcher?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The person he met purely by chance and selected to be the target of a crime was actually the infamous Psychopath Butcher!&nbsp;Dong Pao felt a chill at the thought of accompanying him for half a day without knowing it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He is a very cruel and violent person based on the video...&nbsp;I was lucky he didn’t sink a knife into my back while hunting.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What weak behavior.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Shay shook his head as the scared and panicked Dong Pao.&nbsp;He pulled out a weapon that was around 80cm in length and rotated it with a swaggering attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Since we are already here, shall I measure how good the famous Psychopath Butcher is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the end, he didn’t back down from a fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dong Pao made a fuss.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“H-Hey, Shay!&nbsp;Didn’t you see his battle video?&nbsp;Are you ignoring the power of his wide area skills?&nbsp;He must certainly have a hidden class, so wouldn’t it be better to retreat than fight?&nbsp;Isn’t it better to settle this peacefully?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Peacefully?&nbsp;So a person who killed a lot of people in order to earn money wants peace?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Shay ridiculed before explaining the situation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“As you say, he has a powerful skill.&nbsp;I would’ve avoided him if I encountered him in a normal place.&nbsp;However, this cave seals all types of skills.&nbsp;There is a good chance we can win with that guy’s strength sealed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Shay was almost certain that he could win.&nbsp;Then he started the assault towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Sakak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The sword flashed in the darkness, while the black greatsword stood against it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">When the two swords hit each other, the dark cave brightened for a moment, as if sparks had been lit.&nbsp;At that moment, the terrible appearance of the skull helmet was clearly revealed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Shay remarked,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"If you were a regular person, I would wonder how you could wear such a terrible looking helmet. But it is pointless to understand the psychology of psychopaths.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid shouted angrily.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Do you think I like wearing this helmet?&nbsp;I don’t have a choice due to its performance!&nbsp;Fuck!&nbsp;Don’t call me a psychopath!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Kerb and Sniffer admired the continuous exchange between the two.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That bastard, he is quickly reacting to all of Shay’s attacks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Assassins had high agility, so their swiftness was outstanding among all classes.&nbsp;Shay was the 7th strongest assassin. When thinking about Satisfy as a whole, there were few who could respond to Shay’s attack speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was armed with a slow greatsword but he managed to block all of Shay’s attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dong Pao's mouth dropped open,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Is he skilled in combat, or is he predicting the trajectory of the attacks using Shay’s movements?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kerb shook his head,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"No, he doesn’t have such skill.&nbsp;He is simply fast.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sniffer clicked his tongue at Dong Pao.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Do the Chinese have something covering their eyes?&nbsp;Get rid of it and look properly.&nbsp;The speed with which Grid is wielding his greatsword is comparable to Shay’s attack speed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dong Pao couldn’t believe it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s greatsword was 3m long and weighed more than 20kg.&nbsp;On the other hand, Shay’s sword was less than 1m in length and was light.&nbsp;</span><span style="">When taking into account length and weight, wouldn’t Shay have the advantage?&nbsp;Was it possible?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kerb explained.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"It means that Grid’s strength and agility is high enough to exceed our imaginations.&nbsp;Skills aren’t a problem.&nbsp;That person is a monster with stats.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After exchanging dozens of blows, Shay was forced to step back first.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It feels like hitting a rock every time I hit the greatsword.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His right arm was cramping up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Shay could no longer withstand Grid’s overwhelming attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid... Your name isn’t within the top 3,000 list, but you are much stronger than me. Even if you are a hidden class, isn’t it too much to surpass the concept of level?&nbsp;Honestly, I think there’s a problem with balance."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid snorted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Have you ever met a hidden class?&nbsp;Then you don’t know.&nbsp;In order to obtain a hidden class, constant effort and good luck is needed.&nbsp;Well, you might become a hidden class after 100 years of buying lottery tickets?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Unlucky bastard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Shay signalled to his colleagues.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then both of them moved in a flash, appearing on either side of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"First of all, I’ll make you bleed!&nbsp;Then you will pay with your lives!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Papapat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Sniffer had yearned for a fight and threw three darts while shouting.&nbsp;On the other hand, Kerb remained silent as he aimed two daggers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What will you do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">For Grid who accumulated a lot of combat experience, the thrown weapons were simple.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He spun and hit all weapons flying from both sides.&nbsp;In the process, Grid sensed the unusual weight of the darts that Sniffer threw.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Is he specialized in throwing techniques?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The same assassins might have different characteristics.&nbsp;Some were specialized in stealth, others in swiftness, some in trap and another in throwing weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In a one-against-many situation, Sniffer was able to play the role of a sniper, so Grid decided that Sniffer was the most annoying.&nbsp;At the same time, a flash of black sword was fired.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Aigoo!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sniffer leaned back and narrowly avoided the attack, then threw new darts from that dangerous posture.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As Grid was paying attention to Sniffer, Kerb approached from the rear and swung his two daggers.&nbsp;Then Shay moved up the walls towards the ceiling and dropped towards Grid from the top.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a pincer attack with perfect timing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Victory!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Shay, Kerb and Sniffer were convinced of their victory.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid was beyond their common sense.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was truly absurd.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A golden disc suddenly appeared and blocked all of Sniffer’s darts.&nbsp;Then it flew and blocked Shay’s weapon.&nbsp;Another golden disc was competing with Kerb’s daggers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What were these discs that flew and interfered with their attacks?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The assassins were stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid started a sword dance while the three people were off guard.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Wave!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Black sword waves spread all over the place.&nbsp;Turmoil appeared in the cave as the assassins flew all over the place without even screaming.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cough, cough!&nbsp;Ugh!&nbsp;How...?&nbsp;How can you use a skill in this place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Assassins had passive skills that allowed them to avoid all sorts of attacks with a certain probability.&nbsp;But this cave even sealed passive skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was unbelievable that Grid managed to use a skill in this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Aren’t there many stars in the world?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid spoke as he approached the three people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The three of them were frightened and tried to resist.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh!&nbsp;Shit!&nbsp;Crazy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Shay’s movements were noticeably slow.&nbsp;It was due to the debuff after being hit with Wave.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid yawned as he blocked Shay’s attacks, like it was boring.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Damn you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the moment that someone within the top 1,000 rankings was shamed!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ohhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Suuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid lightly avoided Shay’s attacks.&nbsp;Then Kerb was split in half by Dainsleif as he tried to approach from the rear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You monster!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sniffer couldn’t laugh anymore as he threw all the darts in his possession.&nbsp;But the dozens of darts were blocked by just two golden discs.&nbsp;They failed to even hit Grid’s cloak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Indeed, you guys can’t even catch up with Faker’s toes.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Sukakak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A strike fell from the sky and struck Shay and Sniffer simultaneously.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid watched them turn into a grey light and once again realized how strong Faker was.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he turned towards Dong Pao.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“T-This...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Complete devastation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid fired a single skill and killed three top assassins in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘How...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dong Pao once again checked Grid’s level, since they were still in a party.&nbsp;</span><span style="">150.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had been level 147 the first time they met and he gained three levels on the way here to reach 150.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yes, a mere level 150 managed to beat the level 200 Shay and the level 180 Kerb and Sniffer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is this a hidden class...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was his turn next.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dong Pao had tried to take money and kill Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“H-Hik...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No one wouldn’t want their experience to drop.&nbsp;Experience wasn’t the only problem. In the worst case, a user would drop items when dying.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dong Pao wanted to avoid death, even if he needed to kiss Grid’s feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“S-Spare me!&nbsp;Brother!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dong Pao bowed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid approached him and squatted,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“How many people in this place have begged you with the same emotions you are feeling now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dong Pao had never counted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Looking back now, he was able to realize the great despair that the people who had been harmed by him felt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m sorry!&nbsp;I’m really sorry!&nbsp;I’m a bastard!&nbsp;Brother!&nbsp;I won’t bargain over the lives of others again!&nbsp;I will never commit evil again, so please spare me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?&nbsp;It has nothing to do with me if you do this to anyone else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"B-But didn’t you just talk about how many people I hurt here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I was just wondering...&nbsp;I am thankful for your earlier support.&nbsp;I was going to distribute the items obtained from hunting with you, but now you have lost that right.&nbsp;Yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dong Pao nodded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“That’s right!&nbsp;Your words are correct!&nbsp;I am the trash who tried to deceive you in order to take your life and money!&nbsp;It doesn’t make any sense for you to distribute the items to me!&nbsp;Of course Brother should keep the items.&nbsp;So please just spare my life...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dong Pao begged for his life until the last moment.&nbsp;But he couldn’t escape death.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“K-Keok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dong Pao’s face lost a large amount of blood at once and he quickly became like a mummy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid wasn’t the one who killed him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t tell me, you...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid braced himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="">An unidentified woman appeared behind Dong Pao and sucked his blood like a vampire.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Nice to meet you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The woman smiled through a blood-soaked mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As soon as Grid saw her red eyes, many notification windows appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have encountered Vampire Countess Marie Rose.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Marie Rose’s evil influence makes your magic power turbid.&nbsp;All types of spells and skills aren’t available.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A vampire’s gaze will subdue lower species.&nbsp;You will lost your willpower and control over your body.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Marie Rose's attraction is absolute.&nbsp;Her charm is so high there is even high odds of both genders being attracted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid maintained as large a distance from Marie Rose as possible.&nbsp;Then he carefully opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why did you suddenly wake up for hundreds of years when your seal isn’t released?&nbsp;Were we being too loud?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Marie Rose pointed to Malacus’ Cloak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There is the blood of thousands, maybe tens of thousands of people soaked into the cloak you are wearing.&nbsp;Isn’t that enough stimulation to wake me up?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Malacus, a priest of the Yatan Church, had killed countless virgins for decades.&nbsp;The blood of the virgins completely covered the cloak and was a great stimulus to vampires.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“But you, aren’t you quite unusual?&nbsp;You don’t have strong divine powers like Rebecca’s Daughters, nor do you have strong magic power like Braham, but my gaze and presence have no effect on you...&nbsp;How strange.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Marie Rose appeared to be in her early 20’s.&nbsp;Jishuka had a glamorous beauty and Yura had a neat beauty, but Marie Rose’s beauty transcended them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her beauty was so unrealistic that it seemed like an illusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was so perfect that Grid didn’t feel any attraction towards her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wasn’t bewitched at all and could stay calm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Isn’t this strangeness interesting?&nbsp;Are you interested enough to keep me alive?&nbsp;I woke you up from your seal, so please do me this favor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Marie Rose caused the worst conditions, such as sealing of skills and controlling the body.&nbsp;If she had a strong wide area skill, she would be invincible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From 1st to 200th on the rankings, the top rankers wouldn’t be able to defeat her even if they ran all at once.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was natural for Grid to feel fear.&nbsp;Marie Rose didn’t dislike this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cute.&nbsp;Huhut...&nbsp;Let’s meet again one day.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Saaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Marie Rose’s beautiful body instantly turned into black powder and was blown away in the wind.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After that, Grid was concerned that Marie Rose would come back and took off his cloak.&nbsp;Then he stopped as he was about to go straight to the Vatican.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He found several items on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This is another good fortune!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The assassins and Dong Pao dropped items after dying.&nbsp;Grid quickly forgot about the fear that Marie Rose caused as he smiled and picked up the items.</span></p>
