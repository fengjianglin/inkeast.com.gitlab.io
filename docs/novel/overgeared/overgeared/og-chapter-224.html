 <p><span style="">Chapter 224</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo’s knowledge of human relationships was still limited.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo only used his phone to order delivery.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He treated his phone as a decoration and didn’t care about the battery life, leading to this situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I’m screwed.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo was about to report the university students to the police, when he was shaken by the situation not turning out as planned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The four university students were aggressive towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid, isn’t it hard to manage your estate?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Weren’t you with Yura and Jishuka during the National Competition, so why are you free now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I looked at your age on the Internet, so why are you trying to monopolize these girls as well? Do you want to be handcuffed for violating the law. Eh? Don’t you know?” </span></p>
 <p><span style="">The university students knew without a doubt that Youngwoo was older than them. They didn’t even think about releasing the wrists of Sehee and Yerim.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Those jerks.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo was angry when he heard the university students’ tone of voice and his sister’s pained expression. He wanted to run there and punch them in the jaw.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But this was reality, not Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In reality, Youngwoo was helpless.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had always been one-sidedly beaten by strong people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had been beaten up many times, but now he wanted to commit violence against four healthy university students?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was impossible.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">First of all, Youngwoo looked around. It was to ask someone for help.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, there was no one on the streets. It wasn’t 10 p.m. yet, but it was fairly quiet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the result of Sehee and Yerim finding a empty place to avoid their popularity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This isn’t ideal...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo took a deep breath. He suppressed his anger as much as possible and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Let the kids go. Yes? We aren’t shooting a drama, so this isn’t interesting. Right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo tried to persuade the university students. However, the university students didn’t move at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What if I don’t want to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The university students couldn’t tolerate that he was monopolizing all the pretty women.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Taking Yura and Jishuka, now he was taking their future prospects?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The infuriated university students started to handle Sehee and Yerim more roughly. They dragged them with force and provoked Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"These girls will play with us tonight. Anyway, what does it matter who we are? We’re also people who make money from the game. It doesn’t matter who you play with, as long as the man gives you money right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Let go of me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee struggled to shake off the university students. However, a female high school student was unable to win against the strength of men in their early 20’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Stay still!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The university students grabbed Sehee harder instead of releasing her. Then they raised their hand like they would strike her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Won’t you act more moderately?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that time, the silent Yerim frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"These damn scum... Do you want to die?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo’s string of tension was snapped.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It didn’t matter if he couldn’t fight well.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t stand to see his little sister insulted and treated like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Even though I was a loser.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">When he was a highschool student.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo was always hit by Lee Junho for no reason.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he couldn’t fight back because he was afraid of bigger retribution. He laughed it off, even if he didn’t want to.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He started to be ignored by the other students and this became a great trauma when he was an adult.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It has been awhile since I’ve overcome it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo was no longer a loser.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wouldn’t give in to these thugs just because he was scared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? You will kill us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Puhahaha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The university students laughed at Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In fact, Youngwoo’s school days were famous on the Internet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Some of his classmates circulated Youngwoo’s past onto the Internet after he became famous.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This bastard can’t distinguish between reality and a game.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hey Grid. This is reality, not Satisfy. Try and do Pagma’s Swordsmanship here! Kill! It isn’t possible. Then what is with this courage? Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The university students regarded Youngwoo as weak prey.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even Youngwoo himself didn’t think he could fight against the university students.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he couldn’t retreat, so he just clenched his fists.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s shaky.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A university student spat out his phlegm and approached.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo wondered if he could beat any of them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Youngwoo of the past wouldn’t have endured the pressure and run away.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he improved his self-esteem through Satisfy and had the feeling of ‘courage.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If I have to fight, I will fight.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Fighting spirit rose in Youngwoo’s eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In reality, he wasn’t Satisfy’s Grid, but he had his own pride.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This damn bastard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The university student became angry at the sight of Youngwoo and punched at him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The university student’s fist was quick. He had no qualms about hitting a person.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo was surprised when he saw the flying punch.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s slow?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo had experienced numerous battles with strong opponents in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Just like his dexterity, his vision in reality was also impacted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The university students hadn’t learned martial arts, so they weren’t a threat to Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Deftly.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo succeeded in avoiding the fist with the university student with swift movements.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? He avoided it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The university student made an expression like it was ludicrous. Then he spat out his cigarette and kicked out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a Korean citizen, he was taught Taekwondo during his childhood, so his kick contained more power and speed than his fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If you concentrate more strength in your thighs and buttocks, then your upper body’s forward speed will increase.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The teachings of Piaro passed through Youngwoo’s head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At the same time, Youngwoo’s upper body moved forward.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the kick of the university student flew above Youngwoo’s head and hit the air.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo remembered the teachings of Piaro and felt something eerie as the kick passed above him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It isn’t just the limbs. Mobilize the muscles of the throat to put weight on the end of the sword.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sword?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had swung it thousands of times.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Controlling his muscles?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He received a thorough education from Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo thought of his fingertips as a sword and swung them.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The university student couldn’t respond to the hand gesture that came from below him. He was hit in the chin and couldn’t even scream before collapsing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The university students never imagined their friend being defeated and were shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo was even more surprised than them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I won?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had hit a person for the first time since being born.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He even knocked the person down.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Before, he had always run away or was beaten up.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Duguen!</span></i> <i><span style="">Duguen!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo’s heart thudded at the whole new experience.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The other university students rushed towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This jerk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A university student flew towards Youngwoo with all his strength.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo was still calm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s sloppy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The orbit of the kick was very simple.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo took two steps back and swung his arm.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo’s hand accurately struck the university student’s ankle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The time when he went to Cork Island to collect the fire stones.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo had flown there without a break, and was able to taste the pleasure of pushing his body to the limit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wanted to taste this addictive sensation in reality and jogged with Sehee every morning, as well as going mountain climbing on the weekend. He also didn’t forget simple weight training.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This had been repeated for three months.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a result, Youngwoo’s body was disciplined compared to the weak bodies of the university students that were filled with alcohol and tobacco.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I-It hurts...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The university student that was struck by Youngwoo’s hand shuddered at the pain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was just like being hit by a metal pipe.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was natural.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo followed the teachings of a great swordsman, so he showed a power that ordinary people couldn’t endure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“T-This...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">According to the rumors floating around the Internet, Youngwoo was a loser who was always beaten up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he could actually fight well?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The remaining two university students were shaken.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, Youngwoo admired his own ability and wanted to fight some more.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wanted to enjoy this strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? You aren’t coming?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo moved his finger and provoked them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The remaining two university students couldn’t bear it anymore and moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What is that triumphant air!?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepeok!</span></i> <i><span style="">Peok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The dog fight started.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The university students randomly swung their fists and feet at Youngwoo.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">If two opponents struck at the same time, Youngwoo wouldn’t be able to avoid it unless he was a martial artist.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo responded to both attacks using the footwork he acquired from Pagma’s Swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was like Bruce Lee as he moved like flowing water to evade the attacks from both people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, it was only for a moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo’s body wasn’t tempered enough to keep up these actions. His health was at the level of the general public.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t reproduce Pagma’s Swordsmanship forever. There came a time when he stepped wrongly, twisting his feet and causing his posture to collapse.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hahat! This jerk is a fool!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo was indiscriminately attacked by the university students who laughed at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh! Eek!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Bam bam bam!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo felt like he could see the illusion of stars flashing in front of his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But in the meantime, Sehee and Yerim were freed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Run away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo swallowed down the words to call the police quickly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even if he didn’t say it, he believed that they would report it to the police station.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That is enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Unlike Sehee, who was screaming and wondering what to do, Yerim jumped lightly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo was attracted by her white and smooth legs as she kicked the university students.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pakak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Despite wearing a short skirt, Yerim’s kick perfectly struck the backs of the university students.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Cough..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo suspected that they might’ve died.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The university students exposed the whites of their eyes as they fainted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What? Why is she so strong?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yerim reached out a hand to the stunned Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Can you rise? My prince.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yerim looked very beautiful under the streetlights.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She had a mature appearance that made it hard to believe she was a high school student, and her half moon eyes were sure to fascinate anyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But she was a minor, so Youngwoo didn’t consider her that way.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After that.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? 3rd dan Taekwondo? Hey, then why were you just watching? It’s really too much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In front of a convenience store.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee and Yerim were rubbing eggs on Youngwoo’s bruised face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo was surrounded by two pretty girls, so he looked like a harem king from a manhwa.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Youngwoo didn’t care about other people’s gazes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was busy grumbling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“If Yerim had fought from the beginning, Oppa wouldn’t look like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s rude to interfere in a fight between men, so I endured it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It wasn’t a fight between men... It was one against four.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hihi, anyway, it was great.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo was strong like a normal person.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He might not be really strong, but his courage to protect his sister deserved praise.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Today, Yerim’s crush on Youngwoo became much bigger. She really wanted to marry Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Urgh... Then let’s go back. And from now on, both of you are banned from going to a capsule room. I will buy both of you capsules. Yes? Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo tried to get up from the chair he was sitting on. But his muscles were sore from the aftermath of the fight and being hit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yerim grabbed Youngwoo to stop him from falling sideways.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Haah.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yerim let out a strange sound.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because Youngwoo’s fingers had moved from her underarm to her waist.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo became surprised by the sound while Yerim blushed and her eyes became moist.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Oppa is a really great person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What did that mean?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sehee didn’t know the meaning, but Youngwoo understood it properly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He cleared his throat from the embarrassment.</span></p>
