 <p><span style="">Chapter 50</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s status window was unusually gorgeous.&nbsp;</span><span style="">While he was only level 45, his total stats were comparable to a user in the mid-200s.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Particularly impressive was that he had six rare stats such as: persistence, composure, indomitable, dignity, insight, and courage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But was that all? He also owned four titles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Originally, titles were very difficult to obtain and those with four titles could be among the top rankers. Grid already had four titles at level 45.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Befitting of a legendary class in Satisfy, the status window was truly overwhelming.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Grid was dissatisfied rather than pleased.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I hammered day and night, trained my stats and succeeded in ridiculously difficult quests, but this is it? Didn’t I fight one-on-one against a knight at level 21? But the result is too bad compared to my hard work. Dammit. By now, all my stats should be around 300 points. What type of legendary class is this? Dammit... Euphemina has an epic class but she is so OP she can use all types of magic with no chanting... Ah... I’m unhappy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was paying attention to Euphemina and Rabbit while grumbling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina was wearing a magician’s robe, Rabbit was wearing chain mail and held a one-handed sword that seemed expensive, and his subordinates were holding various weapons such as spears, swords, and bows.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘They aren’t heavily armed so if I increase my attack power, I can easily handle them... I’m not wearing armor right now so I need to increase my stamina and defense... my agility is more than enough with the Ideal Dagger...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was a desperate situation!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid made a quick decision without thinking too deeply.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘150 points in strength and 90 points in stamina.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Since Grid was essentially a blacksmith, it was wise to invest as many points as possible in dexterity. The higher the dexterity, the higher the probability of producing a higher rated item.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid was born as a warrior. He had a basic desire to strengthen his combat power, plus it was wise to raise his strength and stamina to avoid the immediate crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Anyway, my dexterity stat will naturally increase the more items I make, so there is no need to invest my points in it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Furthermore, he received the title of ‘First Unique Item Maker’ after making the Ideal Dagger in the item production game against Euphemina, and this gave him 200 points in dexterity.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thus, Grid didn’t feel sorry about not investing in dexterity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have invested 150 points in strength. Is this correct?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Yes.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Once the points are invested, it can’t be reversed. Do you want to proceed?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Yes.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have invested 90 points in stamina. Is this correct?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'That's right. That is no need to ask, so do it quickly.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your changed stats will be applied.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As a result, Grid’s strength was at 316 and his stamina was at 334.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Considering that the current average of blacksmith users was 80 strength and 100 stamina, Grid’s strength and stamina was an unbelievably high number.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No, it was possible to explain the greatness of Grid’s stats more clearly by comparing it with a combat class, rather than a blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A level 45 combat class had an average of 210 strength and 100 stamina. The average of a class that emphasized defense was 100 strength and 230 stamina. The average of a combat class that emphasized speed was 120 strength and 80 stamina.&nbsp;</span><span style="">More importantly, a level 45 combat class had a total of fewer than 500 stat points.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Compared to general users, Grid’s stats were really great. It was overwhelming.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid wasn’t aware that he was strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Starting with Earl Ashur and his knights, to Doran, Yura, Leo, and Euphemina.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From the moment he became a legendary class to the present, Grid had encountered strong people in succession and carried out difficult quests. So he thought he was weak when he compared himself to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But what was the truth? When equipped with the Ideal Dagger, Grid was stronger than a level 100 combat class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moment when Grid was about to attack Euphemina and Rabbit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hey Rabbit! Why are you talking to that evil girl? I need you to save me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Baron Lowe shifted Rabbit’s gaze towards him. Then Rabbit spoke with an expressionless face,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“You still haven’t grasped the situation? I didn’t come here to help you. I am the one who hired Euphemina to break into your castle in the first place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Baron Lowe and Grid spoke at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rabbit dropped a bombshell remark,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I don’t belong to the Mero Company anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What does that...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Valmont is becoming increasingly oppressive. It has become noticeable ever since he took control of Winston’s trade with your help. It’s pretty obvious that he can’t read the mood in the village and will soon fall; therefore, I have decided to leave because a dark cloud is hanging over the Mero Company’s future. And today, I am prepared to punish you and Valmont.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Baron Lowe’s face turned red as he yelled,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“You! You are just a traitor! What right do you have to punish us? You are a merchant, not an apostle of justice!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“As you said, I am a merchant. That’s why I only move for profit. I have no sense of justice. He is why I want to kill you and Valmont.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit pointed to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid found it strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh? Me?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit bowed to Grid, who looked dumbfounded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I’m glad you are safe, Grid. It was correct to leave this to Euphemina.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this? Why did you betray the Mero Company?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit smiled and explained,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I saw your blacksmithing and realized a new future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“New future?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid, you know it yourself, but your potential is excellent. It is clear that your work will one day be traded among people at high prices. You will make a big amount of money. However, it is hard to do business with the power of an individual. There will obviously be limitations to the amount of money that can be earned. So I would like to work with you. I will help you use all the experience I’ve accumulated as a merchant, as well as the network I’ve built. I will make it so that a lot of people can use your work, from the Eternal Kingdom to other kingdoms.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit spoke his aspirations,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We will make the best smithy, which will have profits comparable to a small and medium-sized company. If you and I join forces, we can clearly succeed. However, in order for me to work with you, I need to reform my image and appeal to you and the residents of Winston. That is why I rescued you, and also prepared a means to take down the Mero Company and Winston’s lord.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes... so you betrayed the Mero Company because you want to work with me? That’s why you sent Euphemina to rescue me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It is appreciated. But why are you trying to obtain the liking of the Winston residents?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Our business will be starting at Khan’s smithy. It has geographical advantages, so Khan’s smithy is the most ideal place to act as a base. In other words, I need to get a job at Khan’s smithy. But how can I get a job when I am blamed by Winston’s residents?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Ahh, I understand. How exactly do you plan to do business?” </span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina urged Rabbit to explain quickly,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Do you have enough time to spare? We are in a hurry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, I understand. Mr. Grid, I’m afraid the detailed explanation needs to be left for the next time we meet. First, you only need to know one thing. I will make you rich. Then I’m going now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit bowed politely to Grid and turned around.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The man who was an enemy was now talking about becoming a business partner... Grid couldn’t adapt to the sudden development and was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It can't be helped. I’m tired so my head isn’t working properly. Let’s log out and take a break.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina called out to Grid who was about to leave.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Hey Grid, did you forget something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This girl, she only saved me because of a quest so why is she acting so condescending. But well... she did rescue me and gave me back my unique dagger...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If it hadn’t been for Euphemina, Grid would’ve failed his quest to rescue Huroi.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid greeted Euphemina genuinely after thinking this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Thank you again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Did you think I called you just to hear that? Surely you haven’t forgotten?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You promised to make me a unique rated orb.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“H-How could I forget? Of course I remember.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had actually forgotten.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The thought of forgetting and then Euphemina killing him because he didn’t keep his promise sent a chill through him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will make it for you. Instead, I need a method of making orbs. Naturally, I’ll also need the materials for it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was sincere.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He intended to make the orb to fulfill his promise to Euphemina.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Was it to repay Euphemina after being helped be her?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was trying to keep his promise with Euphemina for another reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is a great chance to learn another production method for free!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But was that all? Every time he made an item, the level of his skills related to production would increase. Wasn’t it good to raise his skill level using free materials?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I understand. I will contact you again when I obtain them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina said goodbye to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid fell into deep thoughts once he was alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘If I join hands with Rabbit, can I really become a blacksmith who earns the equivalent of a small business company?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was already aware that his class was lucrative.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he tried hard, he would be able to get rid of his debt someday.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Maybe he could even buy a foreign car.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the future that Rabbit spoke about was different in scale.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The revenue from converting a small amount of gold into cash was nothing compared to the revenue of a small business company.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he could earn an equivalent amount as a blacksmith, Grid would definitely be able to buy the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No, a foreign car is nothing. I can live in a mansion with many foreign cars. If I have that much financial power, Ahyoung will be attracted to me!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid shook with excitement.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, Rabbit asked Euphemina after they left Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid seems afraid of you. Did something happen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What? Does it make sense that he is afraid of me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid is the one who defeated the knight called the Northern Nova. In addition, he overwhelmed four knights with just his presence. Does such a mighty person fear anything in this world? That guy is just playing with me. He isn’t actually afraid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hoh...wait? What did you say just now?"&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rabbit doubted his ears.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Grid has the power to overcome a knight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Isn’t Grid a blacksmith?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, he certainly is a blacksmith. But he is also strong. I don’t know what his identity is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A blacksmith who could create a unique item and was strong?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rabbit was able to get a vague hint about Grid’s identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Perhaps he is...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The legendary blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His name was Pagma.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Maybe people only knew him as a great blacksmith, but Rabbit searched through related documents and found out that Pagma wasn’t exactly a blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If he has inherited Pagma’s skills...not only is he an excellent blacksmith, he also has excellent combat skills. Is Grid Pagma’s Descendant? That’s right. It is the most likely option.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He never thought that the person he decided to be his business partner would’ve been a legend’s descendant!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rabbit felt an enormous joy that was beyond words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I am lucky. This is an opportunity to sell works that contain Pagma’s soul.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If he worked with Pagma’s Descendant, he could earn a profit that was equivalent to a huge business company.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rabbit was exuberant. He hastened his steps towards the Mero Company.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“R-Rabbit! You bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Valmont and Philipson, who hadn’t yet noticed that the castle had collapsed from intruders, was caught by surprise by the attack.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Philipson was murdered by a furious Euphemina after she discovered he had kidnapped a young girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then Valmont and Baron Lowe were sent to Frontier and executed by Earl Steim.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But there was a variable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It is obvious that Rabbit saved the Winston residents from the crisis, but he has noticeably been the Mero Company’s second hand man for a long time. Rabbit could be considered a felon for persecuting the residents of Winston, so I will sentence him to 10 years in prison.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit’s mistake was to overlook that Earl Steim was a stern figure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rabbit had expected his sins to be forgiven in recognition of his contribution to the downfall of the Mero Company and Baron Lowe, but he was unexpectedly sentenced to prison.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit was unhappy, but he had to accept it because it was the earl’s decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I have formed a relationship with Mr. Grid... It is regretful, but he recognizes my merits so I should just be glad about that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit smiled as he went to prison.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was satisfied at just decorating one page of the biography of a future legend.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Winston entered a new era.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The village was upgraded to a city and the new lord of Winston, dispatched by Earl Steim, distributed exclusive merchandise to the residents and reimbursed the heavy debts of the residents.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The residents of Winston started talking about the heroes who freed them from their nightmare.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Do you know the person called Rabbit? Originally, he was the second highest ranked person of the Mero Company, but he was unable to tolerate Valmont and Baron Lowe’s evil, leading to their downfall. He is currently in prison, but he is the reason we can live like this now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Do you know the most beautiful woman in the world? Her heart is as beautiful as her face, and she ran alone into the castle to save the residents of Winston. She is the protagonist who caused Winston’s peace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"There was a young blacksmith. The young man with a strong sense of justice fought valiantly to protect the residents of Winston from the Mero Company and Baron Lowe. He tried to protect Khan’s smithy and jumped into the dungeon to rescue the man who was arrested for trying to get to Earl Steim. I am over 80 years old this year and that man is young enough to be my grandchild, but I respect him regardless of his age. Such a just and courageous person is indeed rare.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit, the beauty and the young blacksmith.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The travellers who came to Winston were exposed to stories of the three people from the residents. This was evidence that the three people’s reputation had reached its peak in Winston.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Irene, Winston’s new lady, showed great interest in the beauty and the young blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Anyway, their merits should be recognized. I would like to meet them as soon as possible.”</span></p>
