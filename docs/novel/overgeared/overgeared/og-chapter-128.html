 <p><span style="">Chapter 128</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The Judar Church, Dominion Church and Rebecca Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The three religions weren’t in conflict. Rather, their relationship was very good. The Rebecca Church was like a parent to the Judar and Dominion churches.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The god of health and wisdom, Judar, and the god of war, Dominion, were the sons of the goddess of light, Rebecca.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Among all three religions, Goddess Rebecca was recognized as supreme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The difference was that the Dominion Church had strong armed forces, the Judar Church worshipped health and wisdom, and the Rebecca Church sought justice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, the leader of the Judar Church had great ambitions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"5th Pope Franz was originally from our church. At the time, the Rebecca Church didn’t have anyone to become pope so they took him from our church and placed him in the seat of the pope.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was true.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The 5th Pope Franz was actually the head of the Judar Church. But the Rebecca Church lacked talent and elected him to become the pope.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Look at the present Pope Drevigo. He is someone who isn’t suitable for the status of pope. Everybody has been keeping it quiet, but the Rebecca Church is becoming corrupt due to Drevigo. He should resign and a new person must become pope. It’s natural for the new person to be me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 11th leader of the Judar Church, Pascal!&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a prominent figure claiming to be the descendant of 5th Pope Franz.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to his sincerity and outstanding talent, he became the head of the Judar Church, and now he was dreaming of becoming the Rebecca Church’s pope.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The 5th Pope and my ancestor set the precedent. It wouldn’t be strange if I became a pope candidate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The introduction was too long.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A black haired man, who had been listening silently for a while, wanted to cut to the chase.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“So... What do I need to do for the sake of you and the church?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The identity of the black man was Toban.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was 1st on the paladin rankings and the chief of staff for the Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pascal ordered him as a paladin of the Judar Church,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"The Rebecca Church is keeping the battle gear that Franz used during his lifetime. The Holy Light Crown, Armor and Gloves. I want you to take them back for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A quest has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Franz' Descendant]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Difficulty Level: SS</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The most respected pope was 5th Pope Franz. It isn’t an exaggeration to say that his reign helped the Rebecca Church become what it is today.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal is dreaming of becoming the 14th pope!&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wants to prove to the Rebecca Church that he is Franz’ descendant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he can prove it, there is a possibility that the forces against the corrupt Pope Drevigo will support Pascal to become the pope!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Use any means and methods to reclaim the Holy Light Crown, Armor and Gloves!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal plans to prove his identity by wearing the pieces known only to be wearable by Franz.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Conditions: Reclaim the Holy Light Crown, Armor and Gloves.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Reward: Level +5. The Sword of Wisdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Failure: Pascal’s plan to become pope will be wasted. You will be hated by Pascal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Amazing!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The rankings for the top rankers could fluctuate with just 1% difference in experience.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Gaining five levels was a huge reward for Toban, who was currently level 232 and 68th on the unified rankings.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I spend an average of 8-10 days gaining one level... If I clear this quest, I can gain at least 40 days of effort instantly. I will also jump in the rankings! But that isn’t all...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban felt joy as he confirmed the details of the Sword of Wisdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Sword of Wisdom]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Legendary</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 500/500 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 385 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Speed: +3%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When attacking normally, there is a chance to reset the skill’s cooldown time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Intelligence +250</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A divine artifact of the Judar Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the past, the head of the church only gave it to the person they most trusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Conditions of Use: The best paladin of the Judar Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 450&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I want to have this sword!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Sword of Wisdom’s attack power was ordinary compared to unique level 230 one-handed swords. It seemed lacking compared to the legendary rating.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the option attached to it was a scam.&nbsp;</span><span style="">When attacking normally, there was a chance to reset the skill’s cooldown time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he used it with items that increased attack speed, the synergy could explode.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘As long as I have this sword, I can level like Pon and Ibellin!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Due to the events of the Guardian of the Forest raid, Grid ordered that Toban would be last on the production list.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He could only watch Pon and Ibellin with envy, so the reward for this quest was literally a ray of light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Would you like to accept the quest?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The penalty was terrible if he failed the quest. He didn’t know what he would suffer if his affinity with the head of the Judar Church fell.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Since the degree of difficulty was so high, it was a quest with a low probability of success.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But even with all of this, Toban wanted to do the quest because he coveted the rewards.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I, Toban, will head to the Rebecca Church immediately!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The quest has been accepted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pascal was very pleased with his aggressiveness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“As our best paladin, I look forward to your performance. If you meet up with the spy I planted in the Vatican, he will tell you where the treasures are hidden. Act according to his guidance and bring back the treasures.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban didn’t delay any longer. He immediately set off towards the Vatican.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the way, he asked the guild for assistance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Guys! I received an SS-grade quest!!}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Wow~ you finally received an SS-grade quest? Ohh, when will I have such good luck?}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{ㅊㅋㅊㅋ What are the rewards?}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{A legendary sword. -_-v}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{A legendary item as a reward? Jackpot ㄷㄷ}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{But Toban, isn’t a SS-grade quest really difficult? Can you clear it alone?}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{I think it will be hard on my own. Does anyone have time to come and help me? I will be sure to reciprocate later.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{What are the contents of the quest?}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Break into the Rebecca Vatican and steal three treasures.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{The Vatican...?}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The atmosphere of the chat window changed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Everybody was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Aren’t Rebecca’s Daughters living in the Vatican? Do you have to fight them?}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{That... Isn’t it better than Malacus? ;;;}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Aren’t there three of them? ㅡ,ㅡ;}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Um... Toban, I'm sorry but I can't help you. If something goes wrong, I will die.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Me too... The risk is too big. I’m sorry.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{Maybe it is better to give up on this quest. ~ _ ~;;}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...These guys.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">To a ranker, death was fatal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was difficult to gain one level, so anyone would shed tears of blood if they died. What would happen if they dropped items? It was terrible to even imagine.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t a matter of loyalty.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Realistically, no one was willing to accept such a high risk quest for one man.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Toban still had hope.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Regas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Regas was someone who would help others in any situation! Wasn’t his nickname Volunteer?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban sent a whisper to him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The other person has blocked all whispers.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dammit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban muttered grouchily.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Regas would occasionally block the guild chat and whispers when training, and now seemed to be one of those times. He wouldn’t be reachable for at least a week.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It seemed like Toban would have to proceed on this quest alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I guess it can’t be helped... I have to proceed cautiously to avoid getting caught by Rebecca’s Daughters.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban was trying to figure out a way to clear the quest alone when he received a whisper.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Chief, if you don’t mind, can I help you?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Box?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Box was one of the six new rankers who joined the Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His class was a linker!&nbsp;</span><span style="">It linked magic to objects to control them, or connect objects together to form magic shapes that gave beneficial or harmful effects.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a class that required high judgment and magic power control, so the difficulty belonged in the highest level. However, Box was 1st ranked among the linker rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was only 230th on the unified rankings, the lowest in the Tzedakah Guild, &nbsp;but the guild had great expectations towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban felt relieved that he was willing to help.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Oh?</span></i> <i><span style="">I'm very thankful!</span></i> <i><span style="">But is it okay?</span></i> <i><span style="">You might need to deal with Rebecca’s Daughters?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I don’t mind the risk.</span></i> <i><span style="">In addition, Black Teddy and Asuka are willing to help you as well.</span></i> <i><span style="">If the three of us and Chief combine our strengths, can’t we deal with Rebecca’s Daughters or escape unharmed?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Black Teddy and Asuka were also part of the six new people who joined.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, Asuka was in the 20s on the unified rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Toban noticed that they wanted something.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Do you want something in exchange for your help?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-Yes, please let us meet Bone Helmet.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The six new rankers all joined for a common reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">They hoped to meet Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Based on their attitudes, they joined the guild only to meet Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They seemed interested in what Grid’s class was supposed to be, since they assumed it was a hidden class.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban refused them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I’ve said it many times, but I can’t reveal his identity until I fully trust you.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I swear that we just want to talk to him...</span></i> <i><span style="">Well, okay.</span></i> <i><span style="">You don’t have to tell us who he is right now.</span></i> <i><span style="">I will help Chief as a favor?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-Um?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Isn’t this the process of building trust?</span></i> <i><span style="">In order to build trust, shouldn’t we build up our camaraderie?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">The bottom line is, you want to build up trust quickly in order to discover his identity?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Haha, yes.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">So relentless...</span></i> <i><span style="">Your intentions are impure, but thank you anyway.</span></i> <i><span style="">I need your help.</span></i> <i><span style="">Please.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">He had to rendezvous with the spy near the Vatican.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Toban told Box the time and place of the meeting and promised to meet them there.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then two days later.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban arrived at the meeting place. But Box’s group still hadn’t arrived yet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The church’s spy approached Toban who was standing alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he received shocking news.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pope Drevigo was killed. He lost his life to one who was blessed by the gods, like you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Blessed by the gods was a term NPCs used to refer to users.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A user managed to defeat the pope, one of the currently strongest NPCs?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Toban doubted his ears and asked for details.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"His ID... No, what was his name? How could he defeat the pope alone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I was hiding in the distance, so I couldn’t confirm his name. Anyway, he is very strong. He overwhelmed the pope with excellent swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...I can’t imagine it. There’s such a strong user?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Maybe it was the 1st ranked Kraugel that Pon often talked about?&nbsp;</span><span style="">According to Pon, Kraugel’s strength was beyond the limits of a user. Pon predicated that he wouldn’t be able to compete with Kraugel, even if Pon joined forces with Regas and Jishuka.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If it was him, he might be able to beat the pope alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Even if it isn’t him, the world is wide. There are over two billion users in Satisfy. It isn’t strange that there are hidden people we don’t know about. In fact, wasn’t Faker completely defeated by the unknown girl called Euphemina a few months ago?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But now matter how strong a user was, the pope should have the protection of Rebecca’s Daughters. The user managed to face the pope and Rebecca’s Daughters alone?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What about Rebecca’s Daughters? Did they also suffer with him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The man shook his head,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Rebecca's Daughters are safe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? They’re safe while the pope is dead?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The recent pope was severely controlling Rebecca’s Daughters. In Rin’s case, she was on the verge of being discarded. Therefore, they didn’t help the pope.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The pope was rash.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the first place, the pope wasn’t Toban’s goal. It didn’t matter what happened with the pope. He just wanted Franz’ treasures.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Toban asked about his original purpose,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“The result is good. The Vatican will be in chaos and security will be relatively poor, making it easy to steal Franz’ treasures. Where are Franz’ treasures hidden?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That...”&nbsp;</span><span style="">The spy looked uncertain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban had an ominous feeling as he laughed awkwardly,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Don’t tell me that the person who defeated the pope picked up Franz’ treasures?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...That is literally what happened.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban exclaimed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"No, what about Rebecca’s Daughters? Aren’t Franz’ treasures precious to the Rebecca Church? They just let that guy take his treasures?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes... They felt sorry that they couldn’t reward him more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Crazy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a strange twist.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In Toban’s experience, unpredictable things were always the worst.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ominous... It is ominous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Box’s group arrived while Toban was feeling nervous.</span></p>
