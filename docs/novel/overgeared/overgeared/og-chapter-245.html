 <p><span style="">Chapter 245</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Come out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Zebra ran into his great hall and shouted. Then nine assassins showed up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Zebra absolutely believed in the Black Arrows group.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The assassination ability of those who served Earl Zebra’s family for generations was unmatched. There was no history of failed assassinations.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Zebra ordered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kill the guy who was here a little while ago! Get me the Black Quartz Earrings back!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The assassins suddenly disappeared. Earl Zebra was facing them, and even he wasn’t sure when they disappeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Zebra felt relieved by their excellent skills and smiled evilly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It doesn’t matter what a monster that guy is.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What opponents couldn’t those assassins kill?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Zebra imagined the situation where that person would die and was very satisfied.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moment he was humming.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Nyang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A small cat entered the great war.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a cat with smooth black fur. Only the end of his four feet and tail were white as snow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘C-Cute!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Zebra thought as he watched the cat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The cat’s charm was so absolute that even a crazy human was captivated by it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Zebra was deceived for a moment. He felt a desire to keep that cat around him for the rest of his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But it was only for a moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Zebra barely managed to regain his spirit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What are the guards doing? Why can’t the guards keep a beast out of here? Do you really want to die?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I-I’m really sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soldiers who rushed over at the noise were pale.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had obviously been standing guard fiercely. It was impossible for even an ant to enter. How was a cat able to get in?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why are you just standing there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soldiers tried to get rid of the cat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the cat was very agile, despite its chubbiness. It jumped around the great hall like it was its own home.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Zebra and the soldiers’ eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They witnessed small wings appearing on the cat’s back. They looked closely and saw a small horn on his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“M-Monster...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Zebra belatedly grasped the identity of the cat and shook his hands.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But his dull hands couldn’t prevent the aggressive cat’s dash.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kiyaaah!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Papat!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pa pa pa pat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The short paws of the cat swung at lightning speed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Zebra was filled with a terrible pain. He felt a burning sensation from his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuaaaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A sharp scream rang out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Zebra’s face was bloody like it was mangled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"H-Hik."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soldiers were terrified.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was obvious that Earl Zebra’s anger would fall on them, who couldn’t prevent the monster from entering.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He is going to torture us terribly!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘W-What should we do?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why did this happen?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soldiers fixed their eyes on their spears as they talked. Then they crept towards Earl Zebra, who was filled with a lot of agony and pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Y-You guys...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Zebra lived a life that wasn’t filled with suffering, simply because he was born of a noble lineage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Today was his first time experiencing a major injury since he was born.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was also because of his subordinates.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“How dare you try to harm your master! Don’t you know that this is a felony? Your limbs will be cut off and you will all die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Zebra cried out. But the threat didn’t vanish. The soldiers raised their spears.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Zebra wanted to avoid this and quickly changed his attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If you put down your spears now, I will forgive you and give you a great reward! So please calm down!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He tried to negotiate, but it didn’t work.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Do you think that we’ll believe your words? We know that you tell dozens of lies to those you torture!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We hated you from the beginning! You human butcher! It’s better to get rid of a guy like you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“One of the girls you framed and killed was my relative! She was only 15 years old! You son of a bitch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The anger that had been suppressed was being expressed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If they didn’t kill the earl, they would die anyway.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The soldiers were well aware that there was no turning back. They stabbed Earl Zebra with their spears.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk!</span></i> <i><span style="">Puk puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Y-You...! You guys! Kuheook!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the end of the human who was more cruel and wicked than a demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Nyang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The cat, who was the culprit of this situation, slowly escaped from the great hall.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">"Was this what you aimed for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the outer walls.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kiki had reported the situation in the castle after she used her Hawk Eyes skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Veradin shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No. I just wanted to obtain the bones of the Slaughterer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Veradin couldn’t know why Grid, a duke of the Eternal Kingdom, came to visit Earl Zebra.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he could roughly guess the reason why.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Slaughterer was a bounty monster for many rankers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Maybe Grid came here to raid this place? He predicted Grid’s presence and didn’t report it to Earl Zebra.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a result, Grid raided the Slaughterer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thus far, it was as planned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he had no idea Earl Zebra would be killed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In fact, it was the soldiers who killed Earl Zebra, but the black cat that caused the incident obviously belonged to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s surprising.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was Grid acting for the people of another kingdom that weren’t related to him?&nbsp;</span><span style="">A strange smile appeared on Veradin’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kiki questioned him,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"What should we do? There will be an uproar.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The empire wouldn’t stay silent after a noble was killed. A large scale investigation team would be sent and the atmosphere would become bloody for a while.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That wasn’t the only problem.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The son of Earl Zebra was still young. In addition, he grew up watching his crazy father and was emotionally unstable. In short, he was easily manipulated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was doubtful that the other nobles would give a territory to a lacking boy. It was expected that a bloody faction strife over the territory would occur.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Veradin? What are you thinking? Wouldn’t it be better to report Grid right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dismissed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kiki couldn’t believe it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was an enemy. Now only did he hurt their guild, he damaged Earl Zebra's territory, the home of their guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yet Veradin was intending to let Grid go?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Veradin explained the plan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"We will arrest the soldiers who killed Earl Zebra and get a huge achievement. Then we can increase our influence and make the son of Earl Zebra a lord.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was drawing a big picture.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is an opportunity to go further.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Veradin believed that this work would allow him to devour Earl Zebra’s territory in the future.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would give this estate to his master, Agnus.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The outskirts of Earl Zebra’s castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was waiting for Noe.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I wanted to kill him myself.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Zebra was a wicked man who shouldn’t be saved.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had gone through many adventures, but it was the first time he saw such a brutal person.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was too dangerous to kill the earl himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It would be difficult to access Asmophel if the empire was chasing him, and it would also put the Eternal Kingdom in a difficult position.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he knew that Veradin was a noble of the empire, Grid wouldn’t have touched the White Wolf Guild either.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid didn’t know the truth about Veradin, so he couldn’t feel glad that Veradin didn’t report him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid is a good person? Then you punished a bad person?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Randy started questioning the division between good and evil.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was satisfied at the friend who grew up everyday and replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m not good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right. Grid wasn’t a good man. He wouldn’t sacrifice his life unless it was for his colleagues.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he had the minimum of conscience.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t turn away from those who were in fear from Earl Zebra.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he lacked strength, he might’ve turned away for his own comfort.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I’m no longer a weakling.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was willing to help someone if he could help. But that story was based on the assumption that he would come to no harm.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was Grid’s evolution.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t quite justice. However, he wasn’t really reprehensible.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Rather...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid sensed uninvited people approaching their hiding spot.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t difficult to detect them because he had over 1,400 insight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“These guys, they were sent by Zebra.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The criteria that Grid used to judge the skills of an assassin was Faker.&nbsp;</span><span style="">These assassins weren’t a match for Faker. In other words, Grid didn’t acknowledge most of the assassins in the world.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t just arrogance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His position was right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">An assassin’s weapons were their secrecy and swiftness, but it was virtually impossible for them to threaten Grid with his high insight and unreasonable defense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They needed to have at least Faker’s skills to threaten him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Susuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The assassins were unaware that they would be detected.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After steadily narrowing down the distance, they aimed their daggers at Grid’s neck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Golden blades flew and blocked the assassins’ daggers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Aren’t you using cute tricks?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The assassins’ expressions didn’t change. But they were incredibly surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He noticed our surprise attack? It couldn’t be.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They tried stabbing again, but it was useless.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The golden blades were thrown by someone unknown and flew again, sticking into the assassin’s thigh.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A notification window appeared in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 1,590 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There is only this much damage, even if it’s a critical attack.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pavranium was the strongest mineral.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he made a weapon using pavranium, the attack power would be beyond Failure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But right now, the blades made from pavranium couldn’t exert their full strength.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were made with only a small amount of pavranium, so the attack power wasn’t very good.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Minor must find the western labyrinths quickly.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He wanted to secure more pavranium.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Minor had a lot of responsibility.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As Grid was thinking this, the assassins became wary.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This person has a companion!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was obviously alone when he came to the castle. But now he had a girl with him, as well as a hidden guard.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had to find the guard hiding somewhere that was throwing the golden blades.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But they couldn’t detect the person.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid smiled like they were funny and pointed towards the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Above.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The assassins looked up at the sky and witnessed the golden blades moving alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Artifact!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The astonished assassins looked back at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Keok...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ugh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Three of the assassins were skewered with a blue greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was too absurd!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Are we being hunted?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The past Grid and current Grid had something in common.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He showed no mercy to his enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t waste your time and die obediently.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An iron mask that covered half the face.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At first glance, it seemed to be crying, but now it was smiling.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The assassins experienced the greatest horror since they were born.</span></p>
