 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Reidan’s golden wheat field.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s hard...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Goddess' Agent]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The owner of the unique class, Damian, was working hard in the fields.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wore a straw hat to protect him from the sun and harvested wheat with a sickle, looking like the very image of a skilled farmer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why was a pope candidate working in the fields during such a busy time?&nbsp;</span><span style="">In order to explain, they had to go back in time to one week ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One week ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You can’t enter Reidan unless you knock me down first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian looked at the strange farmer and realized that he had stepped on nasty poo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s sad.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This farmer was crazy. It was an undeniable truth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He grabbed a random stranger passing by and applied for a duel. Now the farmer was acting like a gangster after being rejected?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">This aggressive and stubborn temperament was far beyond the norm.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was also strong.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was difficult to avoid a strong person who was crazy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I was wrong.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian sighed with regret. He came to this distant place to meet Grid. But before he could even meet Grid, he felt like reality was harsh because he was grabbed by someone crazy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Sigh... I can’t avoid this fight.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian had to meet Grid. It was to ask Grid to seal Lifael’s Spear. He needed to knock down this crazy farmer who was blocking the road.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He decided and triggered Light's Blessing.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A golden pillar dropped from the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian’s attack, defense and accuracy instantly rose by 80%.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Light's Blessing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The disadvantage was that the cooldown was long, but the effect was excellent. No, this was the strongest buff skill that went beyond excellence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro admired it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"This is truly amazing divine power!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian glared at him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I will listen to your request. Be careful not to die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A good fighting spirit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No more dialogue was necessary.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The two men immediately collided.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian was a stable one-handed sword fighting machine. Piaro dropped his hand plow and hoe and started using his sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The confrontation between the two seemed fierce at first glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The result?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian was defeated in 10 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Your defense is stronger than the emperor’s royal guards and your healing power is almost equal to a priest. You are the first to stand up against me for so long. This taste... No, it will be fun to train my swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s praise followed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Damian couldn’t hear his voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This can’t be.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to Grid, Damian had been the Goddess' Agent until now.&nbsp;</span><span style="">How many times had he won in battle?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t count the number of monsters that he had one-sidedly slaughtered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The infamous boss monsters? He could survive their attacks for several hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian was the peak of the paladins.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had such pride.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yet he was defeated by a farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And in only 10 minutes!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is ridiculous!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian was shocked. He couldn’t understand it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Surprisingly, another farmer approached him after the first battle was won.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Kraugel, who hid his identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let’s also fight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Shit! Okay! Fight! Let's fight! Damn! These farmers don’t get tired!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian was extremely agitated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sadly, he was forced to accept the confrontation with Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The result?&nbsp;</span><span style="">This time, he was also defeated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Fortunately(?), he persisted for 20 minutes this time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, this wasn’t comforting either.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Unbelievable!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was his second consecutive loss to a farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian was frustrated. He had no doubt that he had become a protagonist, but he was merely an extra.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro made a suggestion to him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“In fact... Duke Grid is currently away from here. He won’t be back for at least three weeks, so why don’t we do this task together?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Together?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian couldn’t understand, so Piaro pointed to the wheat field.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Work in the morning, spar in the afternoon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Indeed, this farmer was crazy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian naturally was going to refuse.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that moment, the quest information window popped up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t a normal quest. It was the rumored ‘hidden’ quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Fun and Enjoyable Training!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">★ Hidden Quest ★</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Live with the farmer Piaro in Reidan. If you join him, you can grow significantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Conditions: Live together with Piaro for three weeks. You must perfectly follow Piaro’s schedule.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Rewards: Strength +30. Stamina +60. Advanced Sword Mastery will rise by two levels. The skill ‘Farming’ will be obtained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the case of advanced Sword Mastery, a minimum of three months training was required to raise one level. This was under the assumption that they hunted without rest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yet he could gain two levels of sword mastery in only three weeks?&nbsp;</span><span style="">His stats would even increase by 90 points. This was the same as gaining nine levels.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'There is the farming skill... No, isn’t the farming skill useless?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Anyway, the quest was too attractive to refuse. The quest name sounded unlucky, but it wasn’t bad.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This crazy farmer wasn’t just blowing smoke.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, Damian accepted Piaro’s offer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It had been a week since then.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian became stronger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He hadn’t completed the quest yet, so his skill level and stats hadn’t risen.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he sparred against the two farmers (Piaro and the still nameless person), and his control skills made a breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now he could hold out for 15 minutes against Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I should be happy, but...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Damian was confused because he still didn’t know Piaro’s true identity. He was also worried about forgetting himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Damian had to meet Grid. There was no need to fret while waiting for Grid to come back.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian cleared his mind and worked hard. He carried 10 stacks of harvested wheat on both shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Far beyond the wheat fields.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A group of people seemed to be approaching.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian cocked his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Who?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There had been no visitors to Reidan for the past week. Reidan was a completely isolated city. So why was there suddenly a group of hundreds?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Damian questioned this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Very welcome guests came.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro laughed. Damian was uneasy because of his enthusiasm.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The Libra Oasis.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the gathering place of the seven guilds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“They don’t have the concept of time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The promised time to meet had passed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Originally, the six guilds apart from the Giant Guild, who didn’t participate in this, were supposed to have gathered here 10 minutes ago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the Ice Flower Guild, Yak Guild and Zeraph Guild hadn’t arrived yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The master of the Golden Guild, Seuron, complained.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Hey Zibal. How much more time should I waste? Do you think the time of our guild is so trivial?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Golden Guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the next largest guild after the Snake Guild and Giant Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their self-esteem had recently risen into the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The guild master Seuron had acquired a unique hidden class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was 70th on the unified rankings during the National Competition, and was now ranked 23rd.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The possibilities for further development in the future were endless.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was evaluated that the fighting ability of his class, ‘Soul Predator’ was much higher than Pagma’s Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“We will wait 10 more minutes. We shouldn’t act on our own.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The guild master of the Hades Guild, Hao, also reached the limits of his patience.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hao was 16th on the unified rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a top player who Yura had pointed out as one of the people she couldn’t beat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Zibal didn’t want to have a dispute with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Anyway, Reidan is vacant.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In fact, the Snake Guild alone was sufficient to decimate Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Zibal requested the aid of the seven guilds in order to promote their friendship.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, the Giant Guild, the Golden Guild and the Hades Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He could rest assured if he was in an alliance with them. For now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Okay, we’ill go trample and plunder Reidan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Snake Guild had 275 people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Golden Guild had 211 people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Hades Guild had 70 people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They stepped towards Reidan without hesitation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A plan to take care of Reidan’s defense troops?&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was no need.&nbsp;</span><span style="">An army of NPCs wasn’t a match against them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Developing such a large city as an agricultural city, Grid has no talent for internal affairs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal looked at the vast wheat fields and ridiculed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He turned his gaze towards the strongest magician in the guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"First of all, shall we turn these fields to ashes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Leave it to me."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The magician, Big Boy was about to summon his flames, when...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Four farmers appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The farmers held hand plows, scythes, hoes, etc, in their hands.&nbsp;</span><span style="">One of the farmers in a straw hat spoke as he stepped forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You’re filled with killing intent. Are you an enemy of Reidan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Puhahahat!”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Zibal started laughing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A farmer dared to question the march of this great army so confidently.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Are you like your master? Even the farmers in this area are dumb.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal laughed for a while before a cool expression appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal ordered. It was as easy as catching a fly. To him, the farmers were nothing but flies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Big Boy launched magic towards the farmer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Flame Tsunami]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In order to burn the wheat fields at once, he cast a large scale A-grade magic towards the four farmers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The tsunami of flames caused the whole area to become hot, and the four farmers would turn to ash...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh? Ehhhh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Big Boy was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t just him. Everyone here was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">When the farmer swung his hoe, the fierce flames disappeared like they were a lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What’s this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The members of the three guilds couldn’t believe what they saw.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro threw off his straw hat and laughed brightly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Welcome to Reidan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Get ready for battle! Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal realized that something was strange and quickly ordered the guild members. But it was too late.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro had already approached.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Fated to Perish.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwarurung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Thunder was heard as the hand plow moved.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The sharp end of the hand plow was stuck in Zibal’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered fatal damage!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have died.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"???"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 2nd ranked user died with a single blow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The more than 550 guild members couldn’t recognize the situation properly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, Kraugel and Damian were astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A instantaneous death skill...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a scam.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro was more powerful than they thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Who the hell is he?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As Kraugel and Damian felt deep doubts, the members of the three guilds were in great confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"W-Who are you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a strange sight to see hundreds of guild members step away from one farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro introduced himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I am a farmer of Reidan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t a lie.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now he really was just a farmer. In fact, he received a monthly salary of 73 silver from Administrator Rabbit. It was fun to save the money.&nbsp;</span><span style="">For reference, Rabbit received 5,300 gold every month.</span></p>
