 <p><span style="">Chapter 343</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The power of a legend was truly great.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Duke Grid, who saved the 1,000 northern troops, and caught the ankles of the 5,000 royal troops.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He clearly proved his strength.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Honestly, Prince Ren felt awe.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid, who swept through the battlefield with four golden hands, was like the incarnation of the battlefield itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The important thing in a war is resources, but power!’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">War wasn’t just limited to the battlefield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Those who had a bigger perspective of the strategies and tactics spread out like cobwebs would win.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In that sense, Grid was the worst.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A ruler plunging into enemy lines alone?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was truly stupid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid! I will make you regret the fact that you entered the middle of the enemy troops!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After a while, a separate group would hit Reidan from the rear, and then the Silver Dragons would capture the duke’s wife.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the initiative would be completely on Prince Ren’s side. Grid would be completely isolated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The victory of the royal army would go as he planned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Huhut! Your stamina can’t endure forever!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In fact, Grid’s movements were different from when he first appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was tired and dusty from dealing with the soldiers, arrows, magic, and the surprise attacks of the knights. He had clearly become sluggish.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I just need to buy a bit more time!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A dark smile spread on Prince Ren’s face as he watched Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He already felt like he had won.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He just needed to hang on longer.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puuoooook!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Heeok!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A rain of arrows from Reidan’s soldiers fell around Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It felt like the arrows wreaking havoc on the royal soldiers were becoming stronger?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I must be mistaken.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At first, he thought so.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he soon realized.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I wasn’t mistaken!’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puuoooook!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kyaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The number of casualties from the arrows were rising rapidly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was clear that the attack power of Reidan’s soldiers had increased significantly since the beginning.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is this...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chucksley called out to Ren, who was pale and nervous.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The archery skills of the enemies are growing in real time! If this is the case, we won’t be able to control the damage to our side! It’s better to have the knights keep Duke Grid in check, while the soldiers defend against the arrows!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No! We can’t do that!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Training one knight was much more difficult than nurturing 1,000 soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Prince Ren wanted to minimize the sacrifices of the knights. The role of grabbing Grid’s ankle should be left to the soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I just need to endure a little longer!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wouldn’t be long now.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Soon, an army would appear and hit the enemy archers from behind.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Prince! The arrival time of the reinforcements has been exceeded!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Prince Ren looked up at the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was just before the sun was about to set.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If things went according to Prince Ren’s plan, it was time for Hurent’s group to arrive here and slaughter the enemies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then why?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why haven’t they arrived yet?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hurent was comparable to Chucksley.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hurent and the 2,000 troops couldn’t be held back by monsters or thieves.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Prince Ren thought for a moment before his eyes widened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It can’t be!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What if Grid had discovered the existence of the second group?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He might’ve prepared an ambush for them!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid!&nbsp;</span><span style="">A person who didn’t receive formal education managed to see the flow of the battlefield?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Does he have an innate talent for strategy?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid noticed the existence of the second group and prepared an ambush for them! It was just amazing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then another sad piece of news was passed onto the disgruntled Prince Ren.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Prince! I can’t detect the Silver Dragons!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"W-What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a magic power detector implanted in the bodies of the Silver Dragons.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The purpose was to thoroughly supervise and manage them, as it was possible the brainwashing might be broken and betrayal would occur.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now they couldn’t be detected?&nbsp;</span><span style="">This meant the death of the Silver Dragons.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘How?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Prince Ren had 100% confidence in the abilities of the Silver Dragons. He didn’t doubt that they were the strongest assassination group on the continent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yet they failed to abduct one woman?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t even imagine it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Unless the duchess is protected by someone as strong as Grid, it is unlikely that the Silver Dragons will fail... Heok!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Perhaps the duchess had a protector that was as strong as Grid?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members who assisted Grid during the Reinhardt golem invasion in the past.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Prince Ren shook as he was reminded of their existence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Considering their abilities at the time, can the Silver Dragons go against them?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What the hell are you...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Prince Ren was suffering from extreme confusion when Chucksley shouted at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It’s difficult to come back from this situation! We should change our strategy now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"W-Why? What should we do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It’s meaningless to buy time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chucksley tightened his grip on the sword he was holding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Put all our strength into killing Duke Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a signal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The knight captain Chucksley and deputy captain Andu.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Those two skilled people, 50 royal knights, and thousands of soldiers rushed towards Grid. It was an offensive that wasn’t afraid of losing people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dust covered the area where Grid was standing.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s dirty.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The average level of the enemy was only 130.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Setting aside Grid, most rankers would be able to slaughter the royal soldiers alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid wasn’t in a position to hurt the royal soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had an obligation to concede the experience to the soldiers of Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was hard.</span><span style="">He had to subdue them without killing!&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had to regulate his strength, causing his stamina to be quickly consumed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘In the first place, there are too many of them.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">5,000 enemies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">When he faced them directly, there seemed to be no end to them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The soldiers of Reidan killed hundreds of enemies with their arrows, but nothing changed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">When 10 soldiers were killed, countless others took their place.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The attacks coming from all directions?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would’ve been hit a few times if it wasn’t for the God Hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘War is never easy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He wanted to evolve Reidan’s strength so that he wouldn’t suffer from this again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid breathed out roughly as dust covered him on all sides.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hit Duke Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chucksley and the knights who had been by Prince Ren’s side.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were simultaneously rushing towards him? The soldiers built a defensive formation around them and also ran.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This is a bit dangerous?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was thinking when a whisper from Lauel was heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Pull out your power.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The chunnibyou instructed Grid. Lauel sensed his reluctance and urged him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">You can’t afford to let the soldiers attack any longer.</span></i> <i><span style="">Excessive greed will poison you.</span></i> <i><span style="">I’ll let the soldiers know what they have to do, so go crazy.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yes, I understand.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">There was no room to spare.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid nodded and took a position that was suitable for unfolding his sword dance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Duke Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Laden and the northern troops rushed to protect Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s too unreasonable! Leave it to me and avoid them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...You.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Laden's expression was shrouded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At first glance, he was ready to die.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid realized why Marquis Steim appreciated Laden so much.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘His loyalty is at the level of Jude.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No, it was higher than Jude.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jude didn’t care about his life because he had no thoughts, but Laden was prepared to sacrifice his life despite having a normal brain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It would be better if he had the skills to back it up.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t know Laden’s skill and misunderstood to the end. Meanwhile, Laden wielded his sword at Chucksley.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I won’t let you pass!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Newbie! Open the path!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Laden and Chucksley’s swords collided in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Think about your body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid grabbed Laden’s shoulder and pulled him back.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to this, Laden was safe from Chucksley’s attack. However, Grid was the one in trouble instead.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chucksley let dozens of knights to strike at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Duke Grid!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Laden hurriedly exclaimed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was impossible for Grid to deal with dozens of knights alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even the four golden hands were useless because they were busy dealing with the soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The shouting Laden feared the worst for Grid. Grid couldn’t help smiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cute guy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was smiling in this situation?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Laden was worried that Grid had lost his mind.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then an amazing sight occurred in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Restraint.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a daunting sword dance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s feet trampled on the desert sand and was reminiscent of a military style.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The air around Grid became heavy and oppressive.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Umm...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The knights and soldiers around Grid lost their momentum and retreated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was only one person.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chucksley was able to overcome the oppression with his mind and body, and stabbed at Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But his sword didn’t reach Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Something rose from behind Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It looked exactly like Grid and rushed out to defend against Chucksley’s sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Doppelganger Randy, who copied Grid’s appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A clone...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chucksley and the knights were agitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was common sense that clones were merely illusions. However, Grid’s clone clearly felt real. It was like facing another Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma's Descendant! Why do you have these techniques when you’re a blacksmith?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The confused Chucksley shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The power of pets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Power of pets?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What was that?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chucksley’s mind became complicated because Grid used hard to understand words.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Meanwhile, his swordsmanship overwhelmed Doppelganger Randy, who only had 30% of Grid’s abilities.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he couldn’t play around forever.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Dragon’s Stretching.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The qigong master’s third advancement class, ‘Master of the Flow.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Its single combat ability was relatively inferior, but it was a class that existed for war because it could change the climate and terrain...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In order to fulfill his role as Grid’s aide, Lauel used a skill he obtained after becoming Master of the Flow.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kurururu!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The desert shook.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The earthquake stirred up the area, causing the sand to pour down in all directions and swallow up the royal troops.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Blackening.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuwaaaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Darker than the starless night sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid released his power in the center of the chaos and brought disaster to the royal army.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Wave, Link, Kill, Transcend, etc.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid poured out everything without holding back. He also had the support of Lauel, the northern troops and Reidan’s troops, causing the war to end quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The northern army in the middle of the battlefield was forced to suffer great damage, but it was a great achievement for Reidan because they weren’t damaged and they raised their levels. It was truly a one-sided victory.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Asmophel wasn’t satisfied with this result.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Please give me a chance to do something...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He wanted to be seen by His Lord.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Grid cried out to the eagerly waiting Asmophel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Asmophel! Recover the loot with the soldiers!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was this role again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Asmophel, who was once considered one of the two pillars of the Saharan Empire.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The tears of a person that Piaro acknowledged soaked the battlefield.</span></p>
