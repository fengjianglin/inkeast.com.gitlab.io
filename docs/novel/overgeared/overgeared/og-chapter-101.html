 <p><span style="">Chapter 101</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">A small town called Pedro, in the south of the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were no special resources in this area. It wasn’t an important geographical location, and there was only one special product here — strawberry-flavored banana.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In addition, people’s reactions to the strawberry flavored banana were negative.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why do I taste strawberry when eating a banana’, ‘I would rather eat strawberries than a strawberry flavored banana,’ ‘It is disgusting because the banana is pink’ and so on.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The special product didn’t sell well, so no money was earned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But for the Giant Guild, Pedro was a blessed land.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was due to the presence of the vampire baron, a boss monster who spawned every 11 days in the underground dungeon of Pedro Castle.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The vampire baron dropped the vampire accessory set and various elixirs.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that Chris decided to become the lord of Pedro due to the vampire baron.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Humans...! I will surely rise again to repay this disgrace!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The vampire baron shouted as he was pierced in the heart with three swords.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris said with a grin,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Yes, don’t forget to rise again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The vampire baron disappeared into dust. Then all types of riches poured out where he stood.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Among the riches were the strength elixir and agility elixir. There was also a vampire necklace.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris took the elixirs without asking for permission from the other guild members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Strength has risen permanently by +3.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Agility has risen permanently by +3.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">10 stat points were gained with each level up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was similar to gaining one level if he drank three elixirs from the vampire baron.&nbsp;</span><span style="">For Chris, the value of the elixirs was high since, at level 290, Chris had to spend a fortnight hunting just to gain one level.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris was happy after drinking the elixirs and taking the vampire necklace.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay. With this, the vampire accessories set is completed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Congratulations, Chris."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You are now even stronger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The guild members who participated in the raid with Chris applauded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris encouraged them,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"The drop rate is good and the vampire baron will keep appearing here, so you will get the vampire accessory set as well. Have strength.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">For a guild of 530 members to be properly controlled, a strict hierarchy was needed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">While small guilds had a family-like atmosphere, the Giant Guild was closer to an army. It had a system of absolute obedience to those above them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This system was so efficient that the guild was developing day by day.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After finishing the vampire baron raid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The executives gathered at the venue for the banquet received whispers from their men.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the contents of the whisper:&nbsp;</span><span style="">A person believed to be the unknown craftsman was discovered in Winston.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As Chris drank his wine, the whisper’s message was delivered to the senior executive Buglima, who organized the content and reported it to Chris.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The unknown craftsman was found in Winston. However... It seems like the unknown craftsman has already joined the Tzedakah Guild.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Tzedakah Guild?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris’ eyes twitched.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was shaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Tzedakah Guild was the guild that dominated the world’s most popular MMORPG L.T.S, before Satisfy was launched.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were small but created a myriad of legends, and the Giant Guild was one of their legendary scapegoats.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reason why the Giant Guild, once considered to be one of the top five powers of L.T.S, left as soon as Satisfy was released could be attributed to the Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Satisfy became a game that transcended L.T.S so the Giant Guild’s quick decision was right, but the Giant Guild’s pride had actually been crushed by the Tzedakah Guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Those damn people... I am starting to hear their names often in Satisfy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris trembled. The memories of the many times he had been beaten by the Tzedakah Guild were still vivid in his head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he couldn’t stay silent at the unknown craftsman being taken away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Send Asellas, Mihara, and Zirkan. Order them to thoroughly hit the Tzedakah Guild until they give up the unknown craftsman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Those three people at the same time...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Isn’t this too much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The executives were agitated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The three people Chris named were part of the five captains of the Giant Guild, each one leading 100 guild members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The fact that they were sent meant that 300 troops would be dispatched to Winston.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But didn’t the Tzedakah Guild have less than 20 members?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It is like using a sword to chase a chicken or cow...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Giant Guild had 11 executives, including the five captains. Six of them had been together ever since the L.T.S days, but five of them were only from Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The five people from Satisfy were the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">They only heard rumors about the Tzedakah Guild and they ignored the Tzedakah Guild, because they had no experience with their strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris laughed at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Chicken? Cow? Are you comparing the Tzedakah Guild to mere livestock? Kukuk! You don’t know it yet. Those guys are dragons. They might be curled up right now, but they can ascend at any moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris had more than 100 clashes with the Tzedakah Guild. So he knew them better than anyone else.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their strength was immeasurable.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their current position might be different from L.T.S., but Chris didn’t have any intention of being careless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Send those three no matter what. Take away the doors of the dragons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He would step on them the best he could.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">As of today, it was the fourth day after Grid joined the Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">During that short period of time, Grid performed great things like improving the guild members’ weapons and making a unique spear for Pon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Today, the Tzedakah Guild decided the second person who Grid who make an item for.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was a boy called Ibellin.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was only 16 years old, but he was a promising boy who took third place in his class rankings. Ibellin had the potential to be Regas’ rival, so they were looking forward to his growth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">And Grid was commissioned to make a sword for the boy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, it wasn’t a usual sword but a flamberge.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The flamberge was a sword that had the appearance of a wave. It was a cruel weapon that tore the flesh of enemies due to the nature of its shape.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was very difficult to forge the sword into the form of a wave.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Let’s start first with the forging.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Forging was a task that made a metal into a solid shape by tapping at it with a hammer. The metal hardened depending on how well the hammering was.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As the metal was tempered, it became harder and harder to shape.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The complex appearance of the flamberge meant it was almost impossible to maximize the forging process.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then was it easy to temper it after the forging? That wasn’t the case. Tempering would inevitably change the shape. Therefore, forging and tempering had to proceed at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">For the above reasons, ordinary blacksmiths gave up halfway through tempering when making flamberges.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Anyway, the characteristics of the flamberge was in its shape so they focused on the shape rather than tempering.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was also the reason why it was rare to see flamberges above the epic rank.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">A blade that wasn’t tempered properly was weak and lacking durability.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most of the flamberges circulating on the market were normal or rare ranked. Flamberges above the epic rank only dropped from monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Grid didn’t want to see a normal or rare rating. He needed to make at least an epic rating to make money.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Status window.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Name: Grid</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level: 97 (140,090/5,531,200)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Class: Pagma’s Descendant</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The probability of adding additional options when making items will increase.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The probably of item enhancement will increase.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* All equipment items can be worn unconditionally. However, there is a penalty depending on the rating of the item.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Title: One who Became a Legend</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Abnormal conditions don’t work well on you.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* You won’t die when health is at the minimum.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Easily acknowledged.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Title: First Unique Item Maker</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Dexterity +200</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Title: Only Legendary Item Maker</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Dexterity +350</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Title: Knight Slayer</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Stamina +100.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Strength +30</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Title: Apostle of Justice</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* All stats +10.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The Apostle of Justice’s bravery is unmatched.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Health: 9,016/9,016 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana: 819/819</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Strength: 824 &nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 572 &nbsp;&nbsp;Agility: 257 &nbsp;Intelligence: 279</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dexterity: 904 &nbsp;Persistence: 273</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Composure: 204 &nbsp;Indomitable: 230 &nbsp;&nbsp;Dignity: 204 Insight: 204</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Courage: 148</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Stat Points: 0</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 15,508/21,940&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘When combined with the title effect, my dexterity is now approaching 1,500.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan’s Advanced Blacksmith Mastery was only at level 2.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid lived with Khan for months so he guessed that the level of dexterity for Advanced Blacksmith Mastery level 2 was around 500~600.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Considering Khan’s reputation as the best blacksmith in the north, Grid had around three times the dexterity of the greatest blacksmiths.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Therefore, Grid was confident in his ability to carry out tempering on a flamberge.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will make it with my own hands. A powerful flamberge that has never been made before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s confidence rose up to Andromeda and had no intention of coming back down to Earth.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hiyah!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kiyooh!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas was in a hurry to find a clue about the thief who stole Grid’s shield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He took care of all the beasts and monsters blocking the way, causing a bloody wind to follow his path.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Taekwon Master Regas!&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was called the strongest in the L.T.S days and his strength, which was now representative of the Tzedakah Guild, transcended the concept of ranking.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even Jishuka, who had the highest unified ranking in the guild, couldn’t beat Regas.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas’ combat sense was incalculable. He was a person who got stronger as he fought.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was no one who didn’t know his reputation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was no one who dared quarrel with him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hey ~ Regas, hasn’t it been a really long time?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Mihara, one of the five captains of the Giant Guild and who claimed to be Regas’ rival in L.T.S, blocked Regas’ way.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I am so happy to fight you again that my head is spinning like crazy. Kukukuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Mihara was a magic swordsman ranked 19th on the unified rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As someone who mastered the sword and magic perfectly, he could overcome swordsmen with the sword and magicians with magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he used both magic and the sword from the beginning because his opponent was Regas.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">He summoned three fire pillars at the same time while blocking Regas’ path with the sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Mihara was excited as he saw blood splashing from Regas’ chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuahahahat! Regas! You are weak compared to the L.T.S. days! The guy who was once called the strongest looks so sad!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas barely avoided the pillars of fire and quietly wiped the blood from his chest. Then he asked Mihara, who had started to chant a spell again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Mihara was shocked by the unexpected question and couldn’t complete his spell.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He shouted with rage,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"You don’t remember me? Damn bastard... No?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He shook with rage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Regas didn’t miss this gap and dug into his side. His hard fist caused Mihara’s vision to shift towards the sky.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeeeeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Keok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas bowed to Mihara, who had fallen from the unexpected uppercut.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I don't know who you are, but thank you for being my opponent. I will be able to grow stronger after fighting you. Now, stand up. And concentrate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">During the time that Regas encountered Mihara.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka and Toban were on the move with eight guild members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were going to raid the basilisk, the king of the desert and so-called wingless dragon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The basilisk possessed top grade petrification magic!&nbsp;</span><span style="">The people participating in the raid now had at least 60% resistance to petrification.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, they were astounded when magic used to freeze their feet appeared from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A user who can use this magic...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The magician Asellas faced the confused party.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Did only your feet stiffen? This... My specialty is petrification magic, but the timing wasn’t good. If so, it’s better if you can’t leave here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Asellas gave a signal. 200 users appeared from the far side of the desert hills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What are you guys?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Toban shouted and Asellas explained with an expressionless face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The Giant Guild. Give up the unknown craftsman. You will keep dying and won’t be able to play the game properly until you expel him from your guild.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A dungeon on the outskirts of Winston.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon was wielding the Gale Spear at a monster in the dungeon when a sword flew towards him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon blocked the sword with his spear, but he couldn’t help groaning at the unexpected weight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was surprised to see the owner of the sword appear from the darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Zirkan...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon knew him well.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was an opponent that Pon competed with more than a 100 times during L.T.S.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It has been a long time, Pon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In L.T.S, Zirkan’s unified ranking was 4th. He was the best player after Regas, Jishuka and Pon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then what about now?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Zirkan was 11th on Satisfy’s unified rankings. Of course, he was higher than Pon, Regas and Jishuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zirkan pointed his sword at Pon,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"You have to play with me here for a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The fact that he appeared in front of me means that the other guild members...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon provoked Zirkan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Are you still wasting time underneath that incompetent Chris?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zirkan laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Master has grown beyond my expectations. Don’t you know? He has transcended the you from the past. It is truly worthwhile serving him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Che, this old man looks happy... Okay, I will knock you down first. Just like in the past.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the same time, Khan’s smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is what Grid is like...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ibellin watched Grid making the sword and was overwhelmed by the force not usually seen from Grid as he stood in front of the furnace. Ibellin didn’t want to disturb him and quietly left the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then he saw more than a dozen users wearing the guild mark of a golden mace approach the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The Giant Guild?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that moment, an emergency notice appeared in the guild chat window.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">{The Giant Guild is intentionally attacking our guild. All free personnel should give priority to protecting Grid.}</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heh...”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Ibellin’s eyes widened as he pulled out his flamberge. Then he stood in front of the smithy’s door and laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Isn’t this quite interesting?”</span></p>
