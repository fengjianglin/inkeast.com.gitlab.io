 <p><span style="">Chapter 46</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p>‘Duplicator...’</p>
 <p><span style="">Blood Witch Yura, the 1st ranked South Korean and 5th rank on the unified rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even she, who was at the top of two billion users, had to chant long spells when using great magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Euphemina, who said she was a Duplicator, could use powerful magic equivalent to Yura without needing to chant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Duplicator...it seems to be a magician type class that duplicates the skills of others. It is an epic class but isn’t this too much of a scam? It completely destroys the balance.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What were the disadvantages of a magician class?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">While the versatility of magic that could be used for various purposes was certainly an advantage, the magician’s strong attack power and high damage were their biggest advantages over others.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The strongest warrior could sweep away dozens of enemies with swords and spears, but the highest attack spell of a magician could destroy an ‘army’ in one blow. This meant a magician had horrific attack power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, every time they had to chant a spell. The higher the level of the magic, the longer the chant. And this was a magician’s fatal disadvantage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Euphemina didn’t need to chant when using spells. It meant she could use magic in quick succession, and the biggest disadvantage of a magician didn’t apply to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">To briefly describe the Duplicator class, it was ‘a magician who could duplicate the skills of others and had no disadvantages?’ She could even learn the Advanced Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Um, so a Duplicator can copy all types of skills and use spells without any penalty...then that is... Ah, I don’t know. Anyway, it is a fraud class.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I wanted to guess correctly about the Duplicator class, but it was painful when I thought about it, so I just focused on finding Huroi.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">"That shameless human...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Because Grid ran away, Euphemina was left alone among the soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why was she in this smelly and dreary dungeon?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Because she had to rescue Grid (the reason for the rescue was to clear the quest received from Rabbit).&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why did she retrieve Grid’s unique rated dagger and return it to him?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Because it was a favor so that their relationship would continue to be good in the future (to be precise, she wanted Grid to make a unique rated orb for her).</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As such, Euphemia treated Grid nicely, only for him to act like this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He used Euphemina’s power to clear his quest and now left her alone with the enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I know that it’s wise to use one person as bait while the other rescues the quest target. I know that, but...”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina’s anger reached its peak and eventually exploded,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"That ungrateful person dared to use me as bait? If I hadn’t helped him, wouldn’t he be trapped in the prison forever and deprived of his unique dagger??”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Shaaaa-</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The air around Euphemina became cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“She is a magician. Don’t give her time to cast a spell!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soldiers surrounding Euphemina felt the danger as their helmets and armor started freezing. They hurried to attack Euphemina, but it was already too late.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Frost Queen’s Breath.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kudududuk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">An unbelievable sight unfolded, as suddenly, a blizzard raged and the soldiers’ bodies started to freeze from their toes up to their heads.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hiik! Body... my body is becoming stiff!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“C-Cold... Coldddd!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soldiers couldn’t run away because their feet were freezing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were frozen in place and suffered from terrible pain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After a while, more than 50 ice statues with expressions of fear were created.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina trembled among the statues.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid... if you hadn’t promised to make an orb, I would kill you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Of the dozens of spells she duplicated in preparation to take care of Piaro, there were only 11 left.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, the number of enemies didn’t show signs of diminishing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Soldiers constantly came and went, as if they were products of a factory.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In particular, she was concerned about the existence of the knights.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She hadn’t encountered one knight yet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It meant that all five of the Winston lord’s knights were alive somewhere in the castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was it possible to deal with all five knights and the tsunami of soldiers with only 11 spells?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was impossible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">NPC knights had a minimum level of 180. No matter how good Euphemina was, she couldn’t deal with all of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hah...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina felt regret.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was blinded by the rewards and the thought of friendship with Grid when she accepted Rabbit’s quest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the water had already been spilled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She couldn’t give up the quest now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh? Aren’t there supposed to be two of them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right. I heard that she broke Grid out and they are acting together... This! Grid went a different way!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“He is after Huroi! He fell to the fourth floor to rescue Huroi. Separate half the troops right now! Half will face that woman while the other half will head to the fourth floor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soldiers quickly confirmed that Euphemina was alone. Then they moved to chase Grid in an orderly fashion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She felt it from the beginning, but the northern soldiers were very skilled. Even the low-level soldiers were good at coping with this situation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was proof that they trained hard. Even though they were weak, they weren’t easy targets.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">So Euphemina did her best.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Demon King’s Tail... No, using fire magic here is nothing more than suicide. Sword of Light.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwachichichik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A brightly-shining, white sword appeared in the air.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina aimed the sword towards the separate group of soldiers pursuing Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Sekeokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The sword of light swept through the bodies of the soldiers, leaving a bloodbath in its wake.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After that, Euphemina used a spell to deal with the rest of the soldiers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now she only had nine spells remaining.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina wanted to preserve her power but more soldiers were coming.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is serious. In the worst case, I might need to use Rolling Dice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rolling Dice was a skill that gave a random effect to the target.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If she was lucky, it would be something that could change this situation into a positive one. But if she was unlikely, it could make things worse.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, she wanted to refrain from using it until her good luck stat was higher, but it seemed she would have to make an unavoidable choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The first thing to do was take care of the knights, while Grid rescued Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...The problem is that he is an untrustworthy man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An ominous chill went down Euphemina’s spine.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She thought that Grid might run away and leave her alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Can I trust a garbage person like that? If he has a minimum of conscience...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She tried to think positively but...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wahh! That bastard won’t have a conscience! What should I do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina wanted to cry.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If possible, she wanted to go back in time and refuse Rabbit’s quest.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The deepest solitary place on the fourth floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Uhh... uhh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had reached his limit so he could no longer even smell the horrible rotten water puddles.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t hear or see anything.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In this narrow space where only darkness existed, Huroi was unable to remember where he was, why he was here and even who he was.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">50 hours in real time, 200 hours in Satisfy, he was trapped in that darkness alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuohh...Kuaaaah!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Terrible screams echoed underground.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid heard the sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Huroi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a familiar but also unfamiliar voice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was able to notice that the screams coming from the end of the corridor was from Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Okay, here I come! This damn bastard. I will make sure you pay me back for all this suffering.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Once this quest was cleared, he wanted to hit Huroi 200 times.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid ran in the direction of the screams.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But his legs soon stopped moving.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I have been waiting.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Leo, the young knight who was insulted by Grid in the interrogation room!&nbsp;</span><span style="">He blocked Grid’s path.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What? Bachelor Ghost? Why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had predicted that most knights and soldiers would be on the third floor or blocking the exit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, he was confused about why a knight was on the fourth floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Who is the bachelor ghost?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Leo turned red with anger and explained.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Weren’t you allied with Huroi? I expected that you wouldn’t escape alone. I knew you would rescue Huroi so I came here to wait for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Ah, damn. I only shared a few words with Huroi. Anyway, the NPCs are using their head.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid looked around. But he couldn’t see anyone other than Leo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Leo looked at him and ridiculed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Hah! Did you think I would come with soldiers? Don’t be too confident! Why do I need to bring soldiers to kill a lowly person like you? My strength alone is enough to rip you apart. Grid...! You will pay the price for insulting me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Leo had an extremely pleased expression on his face. This meant he had a deep grudge against Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was forced to blame his actions a few hours ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I made him crazy with anger... If I knew this, I wouldn’t have been so rude.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Once again, Grid realized that he shouldn’t curse people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But regrets always came too late.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Leo’s blue cloak flapped as he rushed forward.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid used a skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Blacksmith's Rage. Quick Movements.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Blacksmith’s Rage has been activated. Your attack power and attack speed will increase significantly for 20 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Quick Movements has been activated. Your agility and evasion rate will increase significantly for 1 minute.]</span></p>
