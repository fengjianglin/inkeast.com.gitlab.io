 <p><span style="">Chapter 241</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel was just walking along. He couldn’t think of anything in his behavior that would’ve caused wariness.&nbsp;</span><span style="">So why was this person blocking the road? The farmer’s attitude didn’t make sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel felt doubts before making a reasonable guess.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s rare for people to come here, so they are unfamiliar with it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Reidan was isolated. The size of the desert might’ve been reduced by Grid and the Overgeared members’ activities, but accessibility was still low. It was almost impossible to make it past the desert to Reidan until it was a party of rankers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There aren’t any outsiders here so... It’s natural for the residents to be wary of outsiders.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel guessed the reason for the farmer’s attitude and explained.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I am an ordinary adventurer. I’m not a suspicious person, so you don’t have to worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel’s reputation across the continent exceeded 40,000.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Since Satisfy opened, he had always maintained his first place ranking and cleared dungeons and quests faster than others, gaining reputation from this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At the present time, Kraugel was the only person who could use the Reputation Store.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘My high reputation will give confidence to that NPC.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel thought the farmer would release his vigilance and step back.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But what was this?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The farmer showed an unexpected reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Based on your stride, you’re not an ordinary adventurer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was no change in Kraugel’s expression. He smiled as always.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But his mind was quite shaken.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'My stride is unusual? Is he referring to White Light Steps?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">White Light Steps was a skill Kraugel acquired after becoming the White Swordsman. Basically, it increased his movement speed and ability to adapt to terrain. It could also be used for dashing or evasion. The white light normally couldn’t be seen unless under intense sunlight or clear moonlight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He isn’t an ordinary farmer.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The NPC in front of him, Piaro, looked like a farmer in every way.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wore a straw hat to protect him from the sun, dirty work clothes, and held a hand plow and hoe in his hands.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was difficult to recognize him as anything other than a farmer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But you shouldn’t judge people by appearances.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kraugel’s sharp eyes examined Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Who are you really? You aren’t a normal farmer, are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro wanted to answer Kraugel honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have always dreamed of a confrontation with a strong person like you, who is also wishing to achieve the status of sword saint. Compete with me.’ This was what he wanted to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Piaro! It’s time to take a break! You worked hard in today’s farming, so eat a lot!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One farmer couldn’t grasp the atmosphere and came shouting.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was really exquisite timing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to that, Piaro was embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You go eat by yourself.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro said with a frown, before trying to introduce himself again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Piaro! Administrator Rabbit asked if you have found another source of water yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A soldier shouted at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No, what was this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why was he pestered every time he was trying to introduce himself?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro felt a little annoyed at being disturbed. But as a potential sword saint, it was funny that he would get irritated over something like this. He endured patiently.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It isn’t easy to found a source of water. Tell him that it will take more time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soldier left and Piaro tried to introduce himself again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Kraugel raised a hand and stopped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I understand even if you don’t say it. Aren’t you a geomancer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The main task of a geomancer was to find things based on topography. Kraugel’s sharp eyes were convinced.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don't worry. I have trained a lot of skills, but I have no intention of harming Reidan. I just want to stop by the general store. Then I’m going now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro completely missed the opportunity to introduce himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro was embarrassed by Kraugel’s misunderstanding.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he quickly regained his composure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">So what is he was misunderstood as a farmer or geomancer?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was enough if he could compete with someone strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You can’t enter Reidan unless you knock me down first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s hoe moved in a line.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a surprise attack, but Kraugel had a passive skill called Keen Senses. In response to Keen Senses, he used White Light Steps and avoided the attack.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the hoe was like a living snake. It changed the orbit and once again aimed at the target that it missed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel’s eyes sunk coldly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had natural talent and trained hard, so he didn’t easily allow attacks. There was a flash of something silver.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the ‘White Fang’ sword that he acquired from one of the great demons, Drasion, who was defeated by Sword Saint Muller.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chengkang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The hoe and White Fang competed in strength. Piaro was excited when he saw that Kraugel wasn’t pushed by his strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Indeed...! You truly aren’t ordinary!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You will regret it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel’s voice was cold.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was basically a good person, but he showed no mercy to his enemies. He couldn’t turn a blind eye to Piaro’s actions.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kakakang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">White Fang slid down the hoe and stabbed at Piaro’s thigh. There was enough momentum to cut off one leg entirely.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro defended himself with the hand plow.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The repulsive force caused Kraugel’s body to rise high in the air. On the other hand, Piaro’s feet were deeply embedded in the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro shouted towards Kraugel, who had an incredibly angry expression on his face for someone who had just been a gentle youth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I am someone seeking the status of sword saint! I formally apply for a duel!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sword saint...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Among the titles Kraugel had earned, there was the ‘Sword Saint Candidate.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">He naturally acquired the title while developing his swordsmanship through hunting and raids.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After being nominated as a sword saint candidate, Kraugel was spurred to level up even more. He wanted to obtain a legendary class by becoming a sword saint.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His goal was to be the strongest, so he needed to have a legendary class. In the meantime, he had many opportunities to obtain a lot of hidden classes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he was still in the third stage of the sword saint candidate. At least fives stages were required to become a sword saint, but it wasn’t easy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A farmer is seeking this realm... No, he’s a geomancer.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel’s pride was upset.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The person who talked about becoming a sword saint was holding a hoe and hand plow instead of a sword! Before talking about becoming a sword saint, he should start with a sword!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You haven’t grasped the subject.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel’s sentences became shorter. It was due to his rage.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Taack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel used a different application of White Light Steps and rushed through the air like a meteor. The power caused the wheat in the area to flatten and the ground to sink.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the manifestation of ‘Meteor Sword.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Wonderful!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro’s eyes widened. It wasn’t an easy technique unless the body’s physical abilities were raised to the maximum.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was here that Piaro could demonstrate his stats.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He crossed the hoe and hand plow, forming a perfect defense posture that the Meteor Sword struck.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel’s white clothing fluttered like a flag swept by a storm.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kraugel’s expression twisted while a smile appeared on Piaro’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘My sword was blocked by farming equipment?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘My whole body is grinning! This is such an exhilarating feeling!’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Chaeeeeeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Syuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The battle between the two continued, with Piaro disappearing from in front of Kraugel’s eyes. Then he immediately appeared in the rear and struck.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Drasion’s speed...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Drasion might’ve been defeated, but he didn’t completely lose his dignity as one of the 33 great demons. He was the strongest among all the bosses that Kraugel had raided. The highest ranking demonkin couldn’t compare.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But a geomancer had a skill similar to Drasion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, it was more than that.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This wasn’t a geomancer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a hermit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It would be nice if he helped Kraugel, but he actually started a fight.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“React to this!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro was pleased as Kraugel blocked his attack like he had eyes in the back of his head. Piaro was frantic with delight. He wanted to sing and dance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘My eyes were correct!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was like any other day.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He opened his eyes at dawn, trained with the sword before going out to the fields to do farming work. He enjoyed the pleasure of sweating.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Kraugel appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro was aware of it the moment he saw the white-clothed man walking.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This person was stronger than anybody he had seen so far!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hahahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had just been a supporter in Grid’s fight with the doppelganger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This duel would surely improve him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro was filled with joy and plunged towards Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The hoe flew towards Kraugel’s chest, who avoided it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I am quickly adapting.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a clear pattern to Piaro’s techniques. Based on a specific swordsmanship style, the hoe and hand plow were wielded like a longsword and dagger. Piaro stabbed rapidly and efficiently.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an easy style for Kraugel to read.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hah...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro let out a sound of admiration. It was amazing to see Kraugel attacking and defending with the sword in one motion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kraugel provoked Piaro, who had light injuries.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You are strong, but aren’t you too lacking to become a sword saint?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were many titles that top rankers had attacked to Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">God of Control, Lord of the Counter, etc.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had a reason for being so confident.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kraugel’s quick brain and accurate predictions were able to quickly realize the enemy’s attack patterns, while his exquisite reflexes and precise moves allowed him to counterattack.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The more obvious the form, the easier he countered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I also know my shortcomings. That’s why I applied for a duel.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Up to now, Piaro had been using the imperial swordsmanship. It was the same as when he briefly fought Grid at Loran Falls.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“But now it will be different.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ching!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro dumped the hoe and hand plow. Then he grabbed the sword that had been dropped in a corner of the field and took the posture of the Supreme Swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Open your eyes!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Swaeek!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was extreme speed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The stab was like a fired bullet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kraugel had a hole drilled in him and blood poured out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he didn’t allow it to be a one-sided attack.&nbsp;</span><span style="">White Fang had curved outwards and slightly neutralized the stab.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He accurately captured the narrow range that was the disadvantage of a stab.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Then what about this? Supreme Swordsmanship 1st style.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a huge momentum that was like a mountain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kraugel determined that he couldn’t defend against this and attempted to use White Light Steps, but his movements were restrained by an intangible force.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, Kraugel responded with a skill.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Storm Sword!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The storm of white blades crashed into Piaro’s slash. A powerful explosion shook the earth.</span></p>
