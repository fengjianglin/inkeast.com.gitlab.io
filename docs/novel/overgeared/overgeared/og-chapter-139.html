 <p><span style="">Chapter 139</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Flash!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid opened his eyes to the sound of birds chirping and raised his body. The first thing he did was look for Irene.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was anxious at the thought that last night was a dream, then he sighed with relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Irene...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A beautiful girl with silver hair, who he could assert was the loveliest person in the world, was sleeping on his right side.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her glowing skin was shining through the blanket, creating a strange emotion inside Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘My woman.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had never achieved love in 27 years. No, he couldn’t even hold hands with a girl.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was inevitable that he would feel like this towards his first woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will make Irene happy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had a new goal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Irene being kidnapped twice by the Yatan Church were the worst memories of her life. She would suffer from the trauma for a long time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid vowed that he would never let her suffer the same misfortunes again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I need enough strength to protect her.'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Doran would be pleased to hear this from the other world.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Irene was deeply asleep after the exertions the night before. He was worried that he would wake her up, so he got up as quietly as possible, dressed and walked out of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Two maids were waiting for him in front of the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Have you woken up, Sir Grid?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I want to wash up, so please guide me to the bathroom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Um...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One maid was calm while the other had a lively nature.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid followed behind them without thinking and then panicked in the dressing area before the bathroom.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The maids started taking off his clothes like it was natural.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"W-What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">How did the maids manage to take off so many clothes in merely seconds?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was like they used magic, rendering Grid naked in the blink of an eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">He covered his important areas with both hands and shouted,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Are you crazy? Why are you suddenly stripping me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They replied in a manner that seemed as if they thought his reaction was odd.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You have to take your clothes off to wash.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the moment, Grid quickly grasped the situation and asked,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“P-Perhaps you... Are you planning to wash me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes, that is our duty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It is natural for maids to wash their master’s body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘T-This...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noblemen were such perverted people that they forced young girls to wash their bodies!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'These guys... Isn’t this great?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was something he always wanted to experience once when he saw it in manhwas.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The elated Grid removed the hands covered his important parts. Then he proudly straightened up and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay. Take it off and then wash me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had fallen for Irene overnight and swore that he would love her forever. However, that didn’t mean he would be single-hearted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a man! Any protagonist would dream of having a harem! Since ancient times, heroes were always surrounded by girls.&nbsp;</span><span style="">While Grid had no intention of missing this opportunity, reality was cruel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘...There is no reaction.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In Satisfy, sex was only available once a month and it had to be between married partners. If these conditions weren’t met, the sexual function itself wouldn’t work.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Cute maids were washing every part of his body with soft, delicate touches, but Grid didn’t feel anything at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is crazy...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A famous line came to mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I... I am a eunuch...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was frustrated as the maids washed his body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Somehow, the maids seemed to be laughing at him, so his self-esteem as a man was shattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After 30 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The maids finished wiping off all the moisture on his body before Grid left the bathroom with a soulless expression and put on new clothes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were the finest clothing that nobles wore.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The maids admired him as they exclaimed,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Sir Grid, you look so cool.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right! The clothes fit well so you should stand tall!” </span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid confirmed his appearance in the mirror and felt awkward.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"If I wear cheap clothes, Irene will... No, I will ruin the lady’s reputation. But these clothes aren’t too much? I am the husband of the lady, not a noble.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The maids explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"There will be a ceremony soon. Grid will officially be made a noble today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Right, right. This isn’t a costume.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Their words were true.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After breakfast.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Steim summoned Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Irene is my only heir, basically giving her the authority of an earl. That child will become a countess after my death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Aside from her title, Irene is the lady of a big city. It will be a problem if her husband is a commoner... I will like to give you the title of viscount, will you accept it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The nobles of the Eternal Kingdom, an earl had the authority to appoint two viscounts and eight barons.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Earl Steim already had five viscounts under him. He was one of the two nobles representing the Eternal Kingdom, exercising power beyond the law.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then Grid became the sixth person to be awarded the title of viscount by Earl Steim.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have become a viscount of the Eternal Kingdom.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[As Earl Steim’s son-in-law, you have acquired the Steim last name.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have the authority to rule a territory.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have the authority to command soldiers.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You can employ up to three people as knights. You can employ both NPCs and users.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You can give a forceful command to the people. But it isn’t recommended.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You will receive a monthly salary of 2,000 gold.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Yes!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid has a decent salary of 500 gold as the earl’s son-in-law. However, he was disappointed because the amount was too low. Now he was a viscount and obtained an extra 2,000 gold, making it a total of 2,500 gold every month.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘2,500 gold in cash is...!’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was three million won. It was a huge fixed amount, so Grid was thrilled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Steim noticed his satisfaction and asked quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“So... Did the first night go well?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...That.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid couldn’t easily answer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The other person was his father-in-law. What son-in-law could explain the truth about what happened last night?&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, Grid replied modestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It is a level that I can be proud of.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Haha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Steim laughed with satisfaction at Grid’s answer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Irene entered the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her face flushed as she read the atmosphere, then she said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Father, you will be able to see your grandchildren sooner or later. Grid... He is amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh! I see! My son-in-law is so great?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes, he is really amazing. I experienced more than I imagined last night. Perhaps there will be at least five boys in the future. I will give birth to children until I run out of strength and will make Father happy in your old age.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes! I’m looking forward to it! Really looking forward to it! Grid, please use your strength. I want at least 10 grandchildren!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid couldn’t tell the truth that he might not be able to give 10 grandchildren because he could only do it once a month.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He knew the circumstances of the Steim family so he didn’t want to make Earl Steim worry.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...I will do my best.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid barely managed to answer and left the room.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Irene spoke separately to him,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Are you returning to work at Khan’s smithy as planned?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Irene was clutching his arms like she didn’t want to separate from him. She would like to be with Grid 24 hours a day.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid lamented.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Before that, there is something else I need to do. Irene, can you lend me a few soldiers?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had used his skills and increased Irene’s liking to the maximum in just one month. Now he intentionally used that liking.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Irene couldn’t refuse his request.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I can lend you a few soldiers. But what do you need to do that requires soldiers...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The walls overlooking Winston!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid stood next to Irene and spoke seriously while gazing at Bairan Village in the south.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"As your husband, I wish to fight for the peace of your territory. I will defeat the Guardian of the Bairan Village, which has frightened many people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Originally, Grid didn’t have any talent for the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Before he became Pagma's Descendant, he stayed in one city for a year and only reached around level 80.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now it was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had gone through all types of incidents since becoming Pagma’s Descendant and now knew what he had to prioritize in the game.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have to produce Failure first and foremost.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The first item that Grid created, Failure!&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an absolutely fraudulent greatsword. Unfortunately, it had no value as a sell-able produce due to the usage conditions attached.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dainsleif was already the strongest weapon currently in existence, so Grid hadn’t felt a strong greed for Failure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But now he changed his thinking. He felt that he needed Failure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had awakened to the common sense that it was ‘natural’ to have better weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You will fight for my sake, as well as this territory...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right. It is only for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sometimes, well-meaning lies were required!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Irene was thrilled by Grid’s words and replied with a touched look,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You can take 100 soldiers and two knights, but please don’t overdo it and remember to be careful. If you are hurt... My heart will be torn.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She truly was lovely.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I really got a good wife.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid grabbed Irene and hugged her tightly. </span><span style="">He swore that he would surely succeed in defeating the Guardian of the Forest and collect the blue orichalcum, so that her help wouldn’t be in vain!</span></p>
