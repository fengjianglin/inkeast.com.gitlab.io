 <p><span style="">Chapter 199</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style=""> "Son-in-law?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The fact that Earl Steim’s son-in-law was a commoner had now spread through the kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The royal family and nobles thought that Earl Steim was crazy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What idiot would marry his successor to a commoner instead of a political force or a rich noble?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Steim was over 60 years old, so they thought he had become senile.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It was like this. Such a sly snake wouldn’t pass on his only successor to some rabble.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Despite being a commoner, he has great abilities.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘So reliable... I’m envious.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The nobles saw the black-haired man as a heroic warrior.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Didn’t he defeat an ancient weapon that couldn’t be scratched by hundreds of thousands of troops?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">King Wiesbaden was amazed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Your son-in-law is a hero fighting for the kingdom! Earl Steim’s acumen is truly amazing! Your presence if the light of hope for this kingdom!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were two dukes and three marquis in the Eternal Kingdom, but Earl Steim had the highest authority.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because his family was able to build up his power by defending and developing the north over three generations.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thus, many nobles were watching out for Earl Steim. The king praised Earl Steim, so the nobles became nervous.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There’s no way to stop the rise of Earl Steim.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He might become a marquis due to this achievement.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Several shrewd nobles started to flatter Earl Steim.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s amazing. Having a heroic warrior as a son-in-law, your abilities are really impressive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The power of the earl, who has obtained a heroic warrior, will affect other countries. I respect you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Heroic warrior!&nbsp;</span><span style="">This meant they were someone who was talented and brave, and who alone could exert the value of hundreds of thousands of troops. A person of this era who deserved to be admired.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Steim was annoyed at the nobles who misunderstood Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"My son-in-law isn’t a heroic level warrior...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hahaha! Aren’t you too humble?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The nobles thought that Earl Steim was being modest. They misunderstood and thought he was managing his image.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But what was the truth?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"My son-in-law is a heroic warrior, but a legendary warrior! Hahahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the moment when Earl Steim’s pride in his son-in-law reached the peak.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The king and nobles were embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is he saying now...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘He’s too arrogant just because we flattered him a little bit.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They thought Earl Steim was bluffing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was natural.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were only nine legendary warriors in history.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After Pagma and Sword Saint Muller, only one legendary warrior had appeared in the last 100 years.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now Earl Steim was calling his son-in-law a legend? Wasn’t this more arrogant than necessary?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"My son-in-law, isn’t he the greatest? Hahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hahaha...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The king and nobles laughed at Earl Steim.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Reinhardt’s West Street.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kiyaaak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ugh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The army from the north were facing a major crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were hit by rays fired by ancient weapons in succession, and had already lost one-third of their troops. The old golems were pushing the soldiers and the knights were struggling against the soul dolls.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Captain Phoenix, who they had been relying on, left for a while to save a boy and girl, so the situation become more desperate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“H-Help me...! Kuak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ugh! My wife in Winston will become a widow today... Please remarry a better man...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kyaak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Three soul dolls entered into the gap between soldiers and swung a sword made up of parts from their bodies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The series of assaults caused many victims.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Winston’s knight, Romeo Laniche, had come as part of Earl Steim’s troops.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was stabbed in the stomach by a soul doll.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Flop!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">He fell to the ground and gazed up at the sky, thinking about his old colleague.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Knight Deck, who lost his life while facing the Awakened Guardian of the Forest for Viscount Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Romeo smiled at the thought of reuniting with an old friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Deck... I will be your sparring opponent again in the afterlife...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had stepped down from the line of succession for Viscount Laniche. He was bachelor and only cared about training.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had no regrets about leaving this world because he didn’t have a wife or child to worry about.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Just,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is too bad that I haven’t dated in awhile.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Romeo lamented as he closed his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was prepared to accept death.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he couldn’t die.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I can’t watch my wife’s knight die before my eyes. She will be sad.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He killed the soul doll with a blue greatsword and threw a potion at Romeo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Viscount Grid...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Wasn’t this an exquisite moment of salvation?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Romeo and the Winston soldiers were thrilled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Romeo didn’t expect it, but he was joyful after he was saved. He bowed to Grid who said,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Stay alive and pay me 50 gold. It’s the value of the potion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...The price of this potion is 8 gold.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Romeo said carefully, but it was useless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was because Grid had already left this place.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was heading towards the center of the gathered soul dolls and old golems that were slaughtering the northern army.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Viscount Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The knights and soldiers were worried about Grid. It was hard to imagine that Grid would be safe alone against all those strong golems.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid was a legend.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He fought alone against Pope Drevigo, the Awakened Guardian of the Forest, Neberius of the Yatan Church and the great demon Hell Gao.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The ancient weapons might be different, but the old golems and soul dolls couldn’t do any harm to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Link.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He dodged the golems’ attacks while dancing. The muscles that squeezed during the dance were released at once. At the same time, the blue greatsword moved explosively.&nbsp;</span><span style="">21 blue and white energy blades sped through the air at a terrible speed, compressing all the air it passed through.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Silence fell.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The knights, soldiers and golems were all silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This is the time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After Grid spoke, </span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pipit!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pipipipipit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The compressed air exploded, breaking the bodies of the old golems and soul dolls into dozens of pieces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kukukukukung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The golems scattered as pieces of stones.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid stepped forward.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This gaze was directed at the ancient weapon 100m ahead.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“My Lord! I'm ready!”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Huroi shouted as he followed Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid responded to him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I am also ready.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The voice of an orator rang through Reinhardt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The world is watching My Lord! Show them your dignity! I, Huroi, will help you with my strength!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your morale has increased.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your attack power and magic attack power will significantly rise for the next attack.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The next attack will be a critical hit!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi’s ‘Morale Boost’ buff skill had a cooldown time of 10 minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It meant that 10 minutes had passed since the first ancient weapon was defeated, and it was the moment that Grid would turn the battlefield upside down again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Blacksmith's Rage! Fly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid used his own buff skill and flew into the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the sight of a blacksmith holding a big sword in one hand while using magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">People witnessed it many times in the National Competition, but they were still impressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 God Grid has come forward! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The cries of the program anchors relaying Reinhardt’s war situation resonated through the TVs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A white light surrounded the blue greatsword, like the sight of the universe in a dark night sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid approached the ancient weapon from the sky, while unfolding a sword dance like a butterfly. The air around him was heavy, due to all the hatred and killing intent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a precursor of a disaster.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Linked Kill]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A minimum of three to seven blows will be randomly generated that will deal 1500% damage per hit (the current damage of Kill -300%).</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The hundreds of thousands of NPCs and users in Reinhardt. In addition, the hundreds of millions of viewers watching it in real time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Linked Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The greatest skill that he used to defeat Hell Gao was activated.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Roaaaaar!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The ancient weapon whose height exceeded 8m.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The white glow from the blue greatsword aimed at the giant’s head.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Failure’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘5 Joint Attacks’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 6,250,900 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The second blow.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Holy Light Gloves’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘5 Joint Attacks’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 2,238,400 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The third blow.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjeejeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 445,200 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The fourth blow.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjeejeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[Failure’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘5 Joint Attacks’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Holy Light Gloves’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘5 Joint Attacks’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 4,851,000 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the perfect deadly move that made the world shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The head of the ancient weapon was completely destroyed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kung!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kukung!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kukukukung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The scattered rocks fell like meteors, destroying the surrounding buildings.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kukukukukung...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The ancient weapon sat down silently.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel scratched his head while looking at the dust that rose.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"This time, I didn’t have a chance to act.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In fact, Lauel was sweating.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t know that Grid was this strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Did he not show all of his skills in the National Competition?’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Gulp.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel gulped while Sexy Schoolgirl shouted excitedly,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Oppa is so cool!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the beginning.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Waaaaahhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Starting with the Sexy Schoolgirl’s cry, all the NPCs and users in Reinhardt started shouting.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“L-Legendary...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The mouths of the king and nobles on the walls looked like a goldfish’s mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Earl Steim’s power soared into the sky today.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, Grid was grumbling.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"These damn golems don’t give items to the end. They also give less experience.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel clicked his tongue from his spot on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Aren’t these golems quest monsters? Every time you hunt, you can earn 300 gold and 100 kingdom contribution. Isn’t this enough?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid tsked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Why can’t I be greedy? Isn’t it natural to wish for more?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel was amazed by his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s the first time I’ve seen someone like this.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Indeed, there seemed to be no end to Grid’s greed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">While they were caught off guard,</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kikik.</span></i> <i><span style="">Kik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A strange sound was heard from the body of the ancient weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The seven golden blades moved before Grid could react.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moment that the golden blades gathered together to protect Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuwaaaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A powerful explosion occurred around the body of the ancient weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 591,140 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A legend doesn’t die easily. You can resist all attacks for 5 seconds with a minimum of health.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was swept away by the blast and crashed into the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The astonished Huroi, Lauel and Euphemina ran towards him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Ruby and Sexy Schoolgirl were pale and stuck in their place like a stone statue.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the golem labyrinths scattered all over the continent, Braham’s murmur rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[My golems will grow as they fight and will eventually destroy Grid. I will teach you a lesson. Then... Huh?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 28 scattered pieces of Braham’s soul became agitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[What power is this?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As Braham was feeling confused, a notification window appeared in front of all users connected to Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Saintess, an existence with superior wisdom and virtue, has emerged.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Saintess will be an example for the people and will benefit the whole world.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Sehee?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Reinhardt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t because of the notification window in front of him, but because the status of the party window had changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Name: Ruby</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level: 1</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Class: Saintess</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t hurt my brother!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee rarely showed her true feelings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her warm touched started to heal Grid’s ragged body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[20% of your total health has been restored.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"... Percentage heal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The strongest healer in Satisfy appeared.</span></p>
