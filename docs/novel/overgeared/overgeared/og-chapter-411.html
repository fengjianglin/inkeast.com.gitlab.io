 <p><span style="">Chapter 411</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">One hour before the start of the opening event, in the Korean team’s waiting room.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword was pointing at 11 areas on a map of Tira.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The target processing will be very crowded because everybody from 32 countries is participating.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A huge 224 people were divided into 32 teams to compete. Enemies would be present in all directions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The team that stands out too much is likely to be attacked. We should first focus on securing terrain favorable to taking care of the targets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura’s marksmanship was optimized for targeting. But if she focused on destroying the targets, it was likely to raise the alertness of the other teams.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword decided that it wasn’t too late to start the target processing after leaving the center of the battlefield and finding a suitable spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Park Jonghwa checked the points on the map and was puzzled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why are they hills and rivers?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Park Jonghwa was a level 235 archer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was 39 levels lower than the average level of the participants in the National Competition, but he was the top ranker in the Korean team after Peak Sword, Yura, and Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was a famous miser who always smoked and left his wallet at home when meeting friends, but he was quite good as an archer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From his point of view, the areas marked by Peak Sword weren’t very appealing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wouldn’t it be better to occupy the highlands? It’s easy to shoot the targets and snipe enemies.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The higher the terrain, the more noticeable we are to other teams. We won’t be able to occupy it for long.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword realistically analyzed the power of the South Korean team.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Apart from Grid and Yura, it was true that the average stats of the members was weaker than other teams. It was right to be extremely careful.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Park Jonghwa couldn’t say anything further. His pride was strong, so he didn’t like this opinions being ignored.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s easy to build a barrier on a hill or river. Compared to the highlands, the competition to occupy them will be lower. I think it’s good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The level 233 tanker, Kyunghoon, responded positively to Peak Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The level 220 magician Sumin and level 191 tailor Jinhee also agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Since the most important Grid and Yura had nothing to see, they decided to go with Peak Sword’s plan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword pointed to Area B among the 11 areas.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This point is particularly good. It’s deep in the forest and optimized for people to act secretly. As soon as the target processing starts, we’ll move to the northern forest, avoiding the enemy’s gaze and securing Point B. Then Jinhee will unfold his defensive tent and...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The silent Grid finally opened his mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Everyone’s eyes focused on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is there a problem?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword glanced at Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid and Yura recommended that he act as the operations manager in this National Competition, but Grid had the final say on plans.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the authority and responsibility of the captain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"At first, I thought it was a good plan. But as I heard more, I noticed something strange.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What is strange?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword couldn’t easily understand Grid’s thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid told him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Avoid conflicts with enemies and build up a base before aiming for the targets? Can we get a gold medal with such relaxed actions?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Gold medal...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jonghwa, Kyunghoon, Sumin, and Jinhee looked surprised at the words.&nbsp;</span><span style="">South Korea, the team with the lowest average level and power, they would win a gold medal at the team events?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was only a dream.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They thought Grid was joking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, Grid was serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t we need to obtain 400 points first to win the gold? Why are you wasting time camping? Meanwhile, the other teams will raise their scores by a significant amount. Just focus on taking care of the targets from the beginning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Park Jonghwa frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Do you plan to start a full-scale war with the enemies? It’s just a path to self-destruction. Grid, you might be strong, but the four of us aren’t. With our specs, it’s impossible to compete 1-on-1 with the representatives from other countries. It’s a team event, so you have to consider the average level of the team members.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Park Jonghwa believed that he was a clever person. He was absolutely negative about things that he saw were wrong.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We’ll be destroyed in an instant, even if we only face the US team.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid burst out laughing at the certain person.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Self-destruction? Destroyed in an instant?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Flinch.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s eyes flashed ferociously. People shrank back at the sight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid hammered in the point.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It doesn’t matter if you discount your own value, but don’t put others down. In particular, I am stronger than you could possibly imagine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid turned to stare at Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Answer me. What ranking will South Korea get with your plan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“3rd place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword was confident in his plan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their average power might be weak, but Peak Sword believed that they could win a bronze medal if they had a favorable terrain and the power of Grid and Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The bronze medal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Being ranked third among 32 countries was amazing. Perhaps most Korean people didn’t even hope for it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid wasn’t satisfied with this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid wanted the gold medal in order to obtain adamantium.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“3rd place? Come on, let’s go for something higher. Yura will focus on handling the targets from the beginning, while the rest of the members will try and protect her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“But, we’ll be hit right away...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“In particular, we will be defeated in an instant if hit by the high rankers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The higher rankers mentioned here were those in the top 80 who had completed their third class advancement.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid spoke to the nervous team members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Don’t worry. I will burn them all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the result.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“South Korea! Block South Korea!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is he crazy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Shortly after the commencement of the target processing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The 31 teams watching each other concentrated on South Korea at once.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a natural phenomenon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They didn’t know where this confidence came from, but after the game started, only South Korea was destroying targets.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were a good scapegoat for the other countries, who had to reduce the number of competitors.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We are going as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid smiled as he confirmed that the representatives of other countries were acting to stop the Korean team.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Zibal wanted to smash Grid, who was like an eyesore.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel calmed him down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why do you need to be so obsessed with the Korean team when the other teams will take care of them? We’ll use this time to take over the highlands and concentrate on target processing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Um...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yes, why should Zibal care about this person? Don’t get caught up in his emotions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Zibal coldly nodded and the US team broke away from the confusion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Britain, Russia, Canada, Italy, Brazil, Japan, and other teams from 20 countries made the same decision as the US.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The teams aiming at South Korea were made up of 11 countries, including the Turkish team led by Bubat and the French team led by Bondre.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t a small number.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The 7 members of South Korea had to fend off 77 people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bubat and Bondre smiled with satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘PvP damage has been reduced by 50%.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid’s Transcended Link is a ranged skill and can’t threaten us.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Stupid Koreans! You will be embarrassed as the first to leave!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 77 enemies rushed joyfully.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were like moths to a flame as Grid looked at them and started his sword dance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The sword dance had an unmatched splendor compared to his previous one.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Linked Kill Wave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Linked Kill Wave]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Performs three sword dances simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Summons eight consecutive Kill attacks that inflicts 1,500% attack power, chasing all objects within a 2m radius.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The targets hit will have all speeds reduced by 50%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* This skill doesn’t share a cooldown with Link, Kill, and Wave.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Mana Cost: 2,000</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 20 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was Grid’s Greatsword, which had a basic attack power that exceeded Iyarugt and increased the damage of skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The eight stems of energy released from it caused fear to appear in the enemies aiming for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Linked Wave Kill?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It’s different from Transcended Link!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Much more powerful...!’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pak!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Papapat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The representatives attacking Grid scattered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an almost instinctive behavior.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, it was already too late.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Eight of them already became targets of Linked Kill Wave.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Swaeeeeek!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Linked Kill Wave changed orbits like a guided missile and chased after eight people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 31,300 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have become stunned from the big blow.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 34,100 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have died.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Frame Shield has been used. Your defense will increase by 30% for 10 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 19,500 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Three Step Turn has been used.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The evasion has failed.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 37,500 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have died.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an overwhelming sight.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was enough to silence the hundreds of thousands of spectators in the Stade de France National Stadium, as the strongest representatives turned to grey.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“S-Such a thing...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the National Competition, PvP damage was reduced by 50%.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Killing rankers with one blow?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why is he so strong?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s attack power was beyond everyone’s imagination.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The patch has no meaning!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Wasn’t this patch to nerf Grid, who showed a unique strength in the National Competition last year?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bondre whispered to Bubat, who was amazed at the unbelievable result.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Stay calm. The deceased were only rankers in the 200’s who don’t have their third advancement class. Furthermore, most of them are damage dealers. Grid only attacked relatively weak opponents.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was heard.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bubat regained his calmness and smiled grimly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid, I think you used your ultimate skill. But didn’t you just handle the small fries?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid retorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You should know that you’re also a small fry."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had to repay the debt to the masters of the seven guilds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Those naughty people who tried to invade Reidan when he wasn’t there.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid leapt forward and unfolded his sword dance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bubat reflexively took a defensive posture.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid didn’t use a skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Fake, you bastard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid passed by Bubat and reached Bondre.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bondre was excited to face Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">4 seconds!&nbsp;</span><span style="">How much had he been embarrassed after being defeated by Grid in the National Competition last year?&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was a perfect chance to pay back the grudge of that time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had been waiting for this day!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Crying Ice Spears!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaduk!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwadududuk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The hundreds of thousands of spectators were astonished at the overwhelming sight that occurred.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bondre fled to the sky to avoid Grid, created dozens of sharp ice spears and caused them to rain down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Bondre, that bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The representatives from other countries, who were paying attention to the Korean team, screamed angrily.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because they suffered a great deal of damage from Bondre’s wide area magic, despite temporarily being on the same side.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 8,900 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 7,500 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt...]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hahat! Kuhahahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bondre was thrilled by the constantly rising notification windows.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was excited with this spell that showed off his great power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bondre believed that Grid was being beaten by the magic and would soon die.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Crying Ice Spear was a continuously unfolding spell that lasted as long as his mana allowed, so it was possible for Bondre to completely destroy the area.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there was a phrase that constantly appeared between the notification windows that were rising.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 3,100 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The target has resisted the damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 2,900 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bondre’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was one person who wasn’t receiving his magic damage properly!&nbsp;</span><span style="">That someone was naturally...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Gridddd!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Fly, Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Blood splattered from Bondre’s chest as he screamed at Grid, turning the ice spears red.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The red ice spears had hit the strongest defense items against magic, the Holy Light Set.</span></p>
