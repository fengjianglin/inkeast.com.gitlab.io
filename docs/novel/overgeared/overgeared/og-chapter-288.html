 <p><span style="">Chapter 288</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The 13th vampire city.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon and Regas had already explored this place, so they opened their mouths prior to entering.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Once we enter here, we have to go down a 12m high cliff. There is no danger when climbing down the cliff, but there is a risk of falling down because it’s dark and steep. The people with less than 400 agility should move carefully.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"There aren’t any lights and it is dark, so you won’t be able to see anything for around two minutes. Your vision won’t be perfect after two minutes pass. The darkness places a limit on our mobility, so it will be difficult for us to exert 100% of our power. Ah, Jishuka and Faker have their passive skills Hawk Eyes and Assassin’s Eyes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner expressed his doubts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why can’t we light torches if it is dark? Why are we trying to stay in the dark? Are we cavemen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The vampires pay attention to fire. You will be isolated as soon as you turn on the torch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ah, that's right. I heard that before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Stupid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon continued the explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There is a city half the size of Bairan below the cliff. The average level of the vampire familiars wandering the streets are well below the giant worms. However, combat capabilities depend on the existence, so be vigilant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Familiar? Where are the vampires?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The vampires are asleep in buildings scattered throughout the city. Once we enter a building, they will wake up. But there are rare cases of some of them ambushing us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hrmm... The boss must be sleeping in one of the buildings.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s a reasonable guess. We can only go through the buildings in order to find the boss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"In the process, you should be careful of the True Blood vampires. Sometimes they pop up and they are much stronger than ordinary vampires.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"How so?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It was hard to kill them even if Regas and I joined forces.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A field boss?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No, not that strong. If we don’t have divine power, we can’t do much damage. However, if all of us join forces, we should be able to easily defeat them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka, Grid, Pon, Regas, Faker and Peak Sword, the most powerful damage dealers were gathered together.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Pon’s judgment that they could exert attack power that could easily take care of the True Blood vampires.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay. Immediately after entry, please pay attention to the darkness and cliff, and refrain from manifesting as much light as possible. The True Blood vampires... Quickly handle them. This should be enough?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid did a final check on the status of the party.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Party Name: Pavranium Expedition</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Party Leader: Grid (Pagma’s Descendant. Level 296)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Party Members List:</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon (Spear Knight. &nbsp;Level 307)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas (Asura. Level 307)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword (Hidden Sword) Level 306)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker (Master of Swiftness. Level 305)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka (Red Flame Archer) Level 305)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner (Impregnable Fortress. Level 302)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zednos (Storm Magician. Level 301)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi (Orator. Level 292)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Item Distribution Method: Party Leader Acquisition</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to enough rest, everyone’s health, mana, and stamina were full.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The item distribution method was also correct.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t delay any longer. He entered the ant hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have entered the Vampire’s Underground City (13).]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The entrance of the dungeon is blocked. Contact with the outside world will be blocked.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You can’t escape the dungeon until you have died or kill the dungeon boss.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is dark.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was his first feeling after entering.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was &nbsp;a deep darkness that dominated the whole area. He would be confused if he didn’t listen to Pon and Regas beforehand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was as the party was trying to adapt to the darkness.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puduk.</span></i> <i><span style="">Kwaduduk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They heard the sound of wings flapping, then hundreds of small red lights appeared in the darkness.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was countless bats flocking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Crazy! What is this? I didn’t think there would be an attack until we went down the cliff!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The wrong information could be a big threat on the battlefield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Everyone could understand why Vantner cursed as he quickly set up his shield.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Teteng! </span></i><i><span style="">Teteteteng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[Grid’s Shield: Prototype A]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a shield based on the Divine Shield, and combined high defense and magical resistance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He used black iron, which was relatively easy to obtain among the higher ranked minerals.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The disadvantage was that it was heavy, but that wasn’t difficult for Vantner, who had abnormally high strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The hundreds of bats rammed into the giant black shield and scattered blood.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwajik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a creepy sound as small skulls were crushed successively.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A groan emerged from Vantner’s mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He could block the bats flying in front, but he was bitten by the bats that fled to the left and right.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Damn! Forcing me to use a skill so early! Guard of Steel!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[For three minutes, physical defense will increase by 30% and there will be a 50% increase in resistance to stabbing and cutting.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Tatak!</span></i> <i><span style="">Tak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner’s defense became firmer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The small but sharp teeth of the bats no longer reached Vantner’s flesh.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka and Faker were the first ones in the party to adapt to the darkness and they started supporting Vantner.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dancing Arrows.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Papat!</span></i> <i><span style="">Pa pa pa pat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a skill associated with Multi-shot.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dozens of arrows were fired at the same time and rotated as they pierced the bats, changing their orbit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The bats were hit by the arrows flying in all directions and fell down the cliff.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Faker’s actions were also great.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He threw 20 daggers equipped with an ‘Explosion Rune,’ turning the bats to ashes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">By the time the rest of the party adapted to the darkness, most of the bats were already destroyed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Vantner sat down and gasped for breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pant... Pant, dammit. I almost died as soon as I came in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m sorry. I didn’t think the pattern would’ve changed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The monsters in most dungeons had a constant position and behavior pattern.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They thought it would be the same here.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Vantner could no longer grumble after seeing Pon’s sincere apology.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Afterwards, Grid’s group waited until Vantner had recovered his health.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Vantner was the party’s only tanker, so his status was important.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Easy, easy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Once Vantner recovered, the group started descending the cliff.&nbsp;</span><span style="">While everyone was struggling, Grid and Zednos could relax.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were able to use Fly magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The two people were able to descend comfortably.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Taack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The two people landed first below the cliff and looked around.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was to prepare for any enemies while the group was descending the cliff.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Not surprisingly, there were five large wolves rushing in the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“They are scarily large.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Their size was much larger than common wolves. It was at the level of a bear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid and Zednos didn’t feel any fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The +9 Failure has been equipped.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The attack power of the +9 Failure will increase by 20% in dark places.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The +8 Grid’s Boots has been equipped.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The defense of the +8 Grid’s Boots will increase by 20% in dark places.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid believed in his items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Grid is with me!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zednos believed in Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The wolves, who wanted to prey on the two people, quickly realized their folly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Yip!</span></i> <i><span style="">Yelp!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have defeated a vampire wolf.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[490,800 experience has been distributed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have defeated a vampire wolf.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[487,210 experience has been distributed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Vampire wolf leather has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Vampire Wolf Leather]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Very sturdy leather. If it can be tanned well, it will be a suitable material for making armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 15</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The experience was quite good considering it was being shared by nine people. Indeed, the vampire cities were good places to level up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There are three tailors in the Silver Knights Guild right?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid could also make leather armor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">But several experiments showed that the performance was considerably worse than when he used minerals.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From Grid’s perspective, it was more profitable to make things other than leather armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why don’t we distribute the various materials among the guild members and give them requests? We will sell the items made from these materials and raise the guild’s profits. There will be a separate reward for the makers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid gave his opinion to the people who descended the cliff.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was rare for Grid to have such a plan. No, it was the first time, so his impressed companions nodded their heads.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pon and Regas were silent for a moment at the sight of Grid’s further growth, but then they expressed their concerns.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s strange. The atmosphere is different from when we came here before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The bats and vampire wolves weren’t here before. The environmental radius of the familiars is much wider than before. The experience given has also increased by 10%.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas was talking when Pon suddenly asked Grid about his quest contents.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You said that strange energy is coming from the vampire cities?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is the problem. The strange energy seems to have increased the difficulty of the vampire cities.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Gulp!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword was nervous.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He worried about this expedition failing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the other Overgeared members were grateful.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If the difficulty had gone up...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"There is a higher probability of huge benefits!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right! Level up speed will be fast!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was difficult for the tense Peak Sword to understand the mindset of the Overgeared members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was stunned and swept away in their flow. They called the familiars roaming the streets, accumulating experience and items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then they were soon standing in front of an old-fashioned gothic high-rise building.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There are around 10 of these buildings?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They had to search the buildings quickly and thoroughly in order to kill the boss and secure the pavranium.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moment Grid tried to open the huge door of the building.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The master of the 13th city, Vampire Earl Elfin Stone has appeared.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A strong evil influence is making your magic power turbid. All types of spells and skills aren’t available.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A vampire’s gaze will subdue lower species. Your body is subjected to a strong oppression.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The notification windows simultaneously appeared in front of Grid’s party.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Sururuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Black smoke appeared over Grid’s head.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The blond handsome man who emerged from the smoke was more beautiful than jewelry.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Humans dare enter my city! Polluting the air!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone had a story.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was around a month ago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He woke up after a few months of sleeping, only to find his city a wreck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He heard from his subordinates that it was due to two crazy humans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Humans dared invade a vampire’s city with just two of them?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was ridiculous and reprehensible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The incensed Elfin Stone couldn’t sleep properly for the past two months. He was so angry that he couldn’t sleep well.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Today, he got only 18 hours of sleep and went out for a stroll.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he discovered some humans. It was a great opportunity to get rid of his anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Die so that I can sleep!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone aimed his strongest skill at the man who seemed to be the strongest among the humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Extreme Blood Transfusion]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a terrifying attack and recovery skill that restored his health by taking away large quantities of the target’s health.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The disadvantage was that he could only use it once a day, but it was suitable for scaring these trivial beings.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puhahahak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The human male was covered by a curtain of blood.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would certainly die!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Elfin Stone was certain of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kukukuk, I will come back in awhile. I will kill another person, and then another one the time after that! This will be repeated again and again. I will show you the extreme taste of fear!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Suruk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone turned into smoke and disappeared. At the same time, the blood curtain was lifted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid emerged alive from it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What the hell is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The mighty passive with a 24 hour cooldown time had been lost.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he lived.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid and Elfin Stone, both of them were floored.</span></p>
