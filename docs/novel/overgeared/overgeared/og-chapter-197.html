 <p><span style="">Chapter 197</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Sword of Self-transcendence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Divine Shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thorn of Deep Grievance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Legendary Blacksmith’s Hammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Failure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Relieved Wave Armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Fantastic Pickaxe.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Indecisive Mumud’s Orb.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the list of legendary items that Grid made after becoming Pagma’s Descendant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He’d made only eight legendary items in a period of a year and a half.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From the viewpoint of the S.A. Group, it was a very small number. They were saddened that Grid couldn’t show off his presence as a legendary blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But from the standpoint of Grid who lived an unlucky life, eight legendary items was amazing. No, it was more accurate to call them his salvation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now Grid was in a state where he didn’t complain even if the items were normal or rare rated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hrmm..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a ‘special event’ when he made five legendary items, giving Grid a reward and punishment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His mind was complicated after recently making a legendary item (Indecisive Mumud’s Orb).</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sooner or later, he would make 10 legendary items. Would the special event at that time be beneficial? &nbsp;Or would the punishment be bigger?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was full of expectations and fear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was worried that the small amount of stats gained form unique rated items would disappear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Do I have be nerfed again?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A nerfed Grid got +4 to all stats when making a unique rated item and a +10 to all stats when it was a legendary item.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was lower than the stats that ordinary blacksmiths gained when making items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Realistically, the parts about stats acquisition was unlikely to be downgraded any more.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid thought about it positively. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Something good will surely happen when I make the 10th legendary item.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He hoped for that day to come.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A full day had passed since he returned to Bairan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was making items while waiting for the &nbsp;Tzedakah Guild to choose.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Based on the enlightenment he got from making the Indecisive Mumud’s Orb, he sought to create a one-handed sword that improved the prototype’s shortcomings.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Mass-produced One-handed Sword]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 171/171 Attack Power: 264</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Attack Speed: +8% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accuracy: +3%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A weapon made by the legendary blacksmith G.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A one-handed sword that can be easily used by anyone, and is designed to exert high attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It’s an aggressive design that references Dainsleif (Reproduction), and works to improve the disadvantages of the prototype.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 300 or higher. 1,000 strength. Advanced Sword Mastery level 1.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A failure.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Compared to the prototype, it had a much better balance, but the conditions of use were too high. Of course, it was rather low compared to other weapons of the same class, but Grid wanted it to be a weapon that anyone could use.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Next time, I’ll have to delete an option.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to the attack speed and attack accuracy options, the usage conditions seemed to be higher.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid decided to change the design to something simpler and cruder. Then he would change the materials to get more attack power.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Didididi.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">His alarm rang.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He checked the upper left hand corner and confirmed that it was 12:50 p.m. in reality.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lunch time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had to log out. Then Shin Youngwoo emerged from the capsule in reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Today is kan jajang.” (A different type of jajangmyeon.)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A few months ago, Youngwoo had to worry about eating cold noodles or ramen noodles. He couldn’t enjoy the luxury of eating expensive delivered food.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now the situation changed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to his economic success, he could eat delivered food at will. It wasn’t burdensome to eat the more expensive kan jajang over the normal jajangmyeon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This type of thing was a huge happiness for someone like Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a happiness that only those who experienced poverty could understand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo ordered the delivery and sat down on the sofa. Then he habitually turned on the TV.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Will the Tzedakah Guild join me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Tzedakah Guild had built up their reputation and memories, so they might not want to disband the guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'But I overlooked that and even said those words... I’m disappointed in myself.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">From Youngwoo’s point of view, it was hard to be confident that the Tzedakah Guild would come to him. It was fortunate they didn’t call him a traitor for trying to withdraw from the guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘But Lauel told me to wait and believe, so let’s hope.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The new on TV was conveying the situation of Reinhardt, the capital of the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 A huge 100,000 users gathered in Reinhardt to carry out the golem quest. In addition, nobles from all over the kingdom came with large armies under the order of King Wiesbaden. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 This is the end of the golem’s advance. No matter how strong they are, there are only 1,000 golems. Can 1,000 enemies deal with 100,000 users and 200,000 soldiers? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the opinion of the experts, and Youngwoo agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"My father-in-law brought 60,000 troops... Reinhardt will be safe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo hadn’t seen the war video between the Giant Guild and the golems.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because he was busy discussing with the guild and making items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He just knew that the golems were on their way to the kingdom’s capital.&nbsp;</span><span style="">So he thought it was easy to defeat the golems. He dismissed the invasion of Reinhardt as a small event.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaaaaah! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">He was able to see that the atmosphere was incredibly because he was watching the Reinhardt war video in real time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What are these golems? Why are they so strong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The golems that invaded Reinhardt were beyond common sense. They were too difficult for the normal users to handle, even when gathered in groups of dozens or hundreds. The NPC soldiers couldn’t even survive one blow from the golems.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The high level users and NPC knights were slaughtered by the sleek humanoid golems.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was also the super-sized golems.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were exactly 12 golems that could use magic. Every time they launched magic energy, hundreds of users and NPCs turned to grey light. They also protected the golems by using Anti-magic Shields to block the attacks of the human magicians.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Reinhardt quickly fell into a crisis. The walls crumbled and the users tried to get away. Despair filled the faces of the nobles and military leaders.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Youngwoo thought it was absurd.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Based on the video, the 12 super-sized golems were at least as strong as the Awakened Guardian of the Forest. And the 200 humanoid golems were like boss-sized monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What type of magician could make this golem?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Uh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Youngwoo was feeling doubts when his eyes suddenly widened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because he found a familiar face in the video where people were dying in Reinhardt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sehee?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was clearly Sehee.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His sister Sehee was squatting in a corner of Reinhardt and shaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Damn!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reason why Sehee was playing Satisfy didn’t matter now.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He threw his food on the table and rushed out. He headed straight to the capsule.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was determined to rescue Sehee before the food got cold.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Winston Castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel sent a whisper to Grid like he had been waiting.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">You came.</span></i> <i><span style="">A king’s quest was granted to all users within the Eternal Kingdom a little while ago.</span></i> <i><span style="">The rewards are enormous, so why don’t you try the quest?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Then the [Fight the Golems] quest window emerged in front of Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Meanwhile, Irene came running.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Dear husband!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Irene?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Irene was teary-eyed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She rushed at the confused Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The battle for Reinhardt isn’t going well. I’m anxious about my father."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After the [Fight the Golems] quest, a new quest appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Save Earl Steim]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Difficulty: A</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The golems that invaded Reinhardt Capital are stronger than expected and the situation has worsened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Earl Steim is almost certainly in a crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Save him for Lady Irene.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Conditions: The survival of Earl Steim.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Rewards: Your affinity with Earl Steim will reach the maximum and you will be able to exercise great power in the north.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Failure: Level -1. If Earl Steim dies, Lady Irene will be locked in grief for a while. There is room for your marital relations to worsen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Please help my father.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Despite being a NPC, Irene was a precious person who taught Grid how to love.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid didn’t want to see her look sad.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He decided.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I will bring Father-in-law back unharmed. So don’t worry and wait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The quest has been accepted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He needed to arrive in Reinhardt as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid hadn’t been to Reinhardt so he couldn’t measure the exact distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Lauel, what is the distance from Winston to Reinhardt?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It will probably take half a day if you use Fly.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">This...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe was too small to ride, so he needed help from a drake.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was about to call Huroi when Lauel gave him advice.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">-Euphemina is a Duplicator, and doesn’t she always have a number of spells copied?</span></i> <i><span style="">She might’ve duplicated Mass Teleport.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">He was truly smart.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The impressed Grid sent a whisper to Euphemina.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Euphemina, do you have Mass Teleport available?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“I do. It is precious magic that I’ve saved, but I am willing to use it for you. What’s the destination?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina’s answer came from behind him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She had good timing as she was on standby in Winston. It was lovely.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid smiled brightly and immediately replied.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Reinhardt.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Are there no mighty warriors to deal with those golems? The shortage of talent is too great!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Reinhardt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">King Wiesbaden screamed from the walls.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The north’s strongest knight, Phoenix. The west’s strongest knight, Ector. The east’s strongest knight, Kis. King Wiesbaden</span><span style="">&nbsp;felt desperate, as there weren’t enough people in the kingdom to deal with the golems except for these three and a few others.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Even the royal bodyguards made up of elite knights were helpless in front of the golems.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The hundreds of thousands of troops?&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were useless. The soldiers stabbed with their swords and spears, but they couldn’t even scratch the golems.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Magic was necessary to deal with golems, but the magic had no effect because of the Anti-magic Shield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a total crisis.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The city was rapidly collapsing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wiesbaden and the nobles prayed to the gods.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Rebecca, goddess of light! Please give me strength to protect my kingdom and my people...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The gods certainly existed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, there were few cases where prayers succeeded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The king and nobles knew this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, the prayers dwindled.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuuong!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kuuong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">There was only the sound of walls and buildings collapsed, as well as the screams of the people.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“All of them are gathered together."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Happy, the 304th ranker on the unified rankings looked at the battlefield and clicked his tongue.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Out of the 100,000 users in Reinhardt, 99,900 of them were average level users, so the situation went bad.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Sigh, I was expecting more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The top ranking players tended to engage in personal hunting rather than events.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Happy once again realized that he had to leave Reinhardt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most users were like him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">How many of the 100,000 users gathered here were willing to fight in the hopes of protecting Reinhardt?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most of the people came to try out the quest, and there was no merit to them staying.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a big fuss in North Street.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The gazes of Happy and other users turned in that direction.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then they saw it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A female user wearing novice clothing was throwing herself over a NPC.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The people laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Pfff, beginners are so pure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I agree. At first, I tried to save NPCs as well. Kilkil.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Well, it’s not like experience will drop when dying for a beginner. Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The users mocking the beginner turned their eyes towards the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the same for King Wiesbaden and the nobles on the wall.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A bright light flashed in the evening sky and started to grow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Mass Teleport?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A few people quickly figured out the identity of the light.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Soon, a man and woman emerged from the light.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was a blonde girl with a lovely doll-like appearance and an Asian man.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This damn thing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Asian man who appeared from the Mass Teleport.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He plummeted towards the ground while screaming.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Get your hands off my sister!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His furious voice spread through Reinhardt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Everyone, including the users, NPCs and golems, turned their gaze towards the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then they witnessed it at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The blue greatsword reminiscent of a predator of that sea that smashed into the soul doll!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok! T-That person!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“G...God...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The person who used the blue greatsword in the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was an existence that all users in Satisfy knew.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The first legendary class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the moment when Grid appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The users cheered as they saw him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“God Grid! God Grid has showed up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Grid has appeared with exquisite timing! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Doesn’t this remind you of the scene in the National Competition a few months ago? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 A protagonist always followed the basic rule of coming late. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Reinhardt war video got the highest ratings as it was broadcasted through various channels around the world.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid succeeded in protecting Sehee and Yerim as the world watched.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He shouted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Summon Knights! Huroi! Lauel! Jude!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pak!</span></i> <i><span style="">Papat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">In front of Grid, the strongest of the 10 Rookies appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was also the first ranked orator Huroi that some people knew about.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In addition, there was an NPC.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Summon knights?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Truly God Grid...! He’s become a noble!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'He summoned three knights, so he is a viscount? Amazing...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As people felt admiration, Grid commanded his party.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Smash all these damn golems. First, I need to make a party with my sister.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the moment when the struggle was about to begin.</span></p>
