 <p><span style="">Chapter 290</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style=""> “M-Malacus’s Cloak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was a little too much.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Weren’t vampires sensitive to the smell of blood?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The vampires would come flocking like dogs if Malacus’ Cloak was used.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was like digging his grave.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have to wear this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner hesitated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, Grid and his colleagues showed a firm determination.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Vantner, there is no time to spare.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Speed is important. We have to make them keep coming.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We will help you, so don’t worry and put on the cloak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Okay, I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Every member of Overgeared was prepared to die.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Vantner was no different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">He prepared his mind and took the lead after wearing Malacus’ Cloak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t delay. He entered the large building in front of him.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">"It is really wide. It is bigger than it seems from the outside.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is bad. It is better to fight a lot of enemies in a narrow space.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes. This place is completely open without any cover.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The voices of the party members echoed in every corner.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The first floor of the building was a huge hall. It could accommodate at least 2,000 people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The ceiling reached to the 7th floor and there were two staircases leading upstairs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I think it’s better to get in a formation on the stairs, as it’ll be easier for us to be surrounded by the enemies on the upper levels than to be surrounded on all sides.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was Jishuka’s opinion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The other members agreed and quickly moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It is dreary.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It is like a cemetery.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the center of the dark hallway, hundreds of coffins were randomly arranged. It was a creepy sight.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kung!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kung kung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It happened when Grid’s party reached the stairs.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The silent building suddenly became noisy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because the hundreds of coffins started shaking in unison.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The vampires sleeping in the coffins were reacting to the bloody smell of Malacus’ Cloak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"They’re coming!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Be prepared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s group quickly got into formation and pulled out their weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a dark red greatbow that resembled a roaring dragon, a blue spear with a great appearance, gauntlets that seemed like they could easily crush the enemy, dazzling silver daggers and so on.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were all Grid’s works.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The existence of Grid for the Overgeared members was incredibly large.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kung!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kung!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The coffins opened and the vampires appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had pale skin, long fangs, and red eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their red eyes turned towards Grid’s group. To be precise, it was towards Vantner.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This fragrance is good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“As soon as I open my eyes, I can celebrate with human blood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The vampires were the top predators.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They didn’t feel any nervousness about the people who invaded their territory. Rather, they laughed like they were happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Fast!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The vampires living in the underground cities were different from those who popped up all over the continent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their combat power was between level 280~350.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Give me blood! I shall enjoy it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ohuhut, shall we aim for that man’s clean neck?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 200 vampires quickly narrowed the distance to Grid’s group. It was a tremendous speed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They aimed for Vantner who monopolized their aggro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I don’t think I can hold out for long! Guard of Steel! Guardian of Wisdom! Giant’s Blessing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[For three minutes, physical defense will increase by 30% and there will be a 50% increase in resistance to stabbing and cutting.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[For three minutes, magic resistance will increase by 30% and attributes resistance will increase by 50%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A shield that will absorb 20,000 damage has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner had invested all his stat points into strength until level 200.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Nonetheless, he was able to play his role as ranker thanks to the excellent defense skills of a guardian knight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sun Guard!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Flash!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A bright light shone on the bald Vantner. It was the reflection of the light emitted from his shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The sudden emergence of light caused the vampires to lose momentum.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most of them lost their eyesight and stopped in place for a moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the 50 vampires in the rear were relatively fine.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They hit Vantner first.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjejeong!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kukwakwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 5,600 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 5,980 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 7,110 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ack! It hurts! Hurts!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vampires had excellent physical abilities, magic power, and intelligence.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They used magic to provoke Vantner’s magic resistance skills, then linked physical attacks. In some cases, it was the opposite.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Vantner was unable to demonstrate a complete defense and was quickly wounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members weren’t watching quietly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Zednos started first.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As Vantner pulled the aggro at the bottom of the stairs, he completed the long chant for the Storm of Eternity.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The storm rapidly rotated around a previously determined point, trapping the 50 vampires within and making unable to do anything.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the ultimate storm from the Storm Magician Zednos that could confine many enemies for a minimum of 30 seconds to a maximum of 5 minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The disadvantage was that no attacks from outside could occur, but it was a strategically useful magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Well done!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to Zednos, Vantner could now breathe.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He took a potion, while the remaining 150 vampires restored their eyesight and rushed over.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Vantner’s suffering began from now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“S-Save me! Aaack~!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Papat!</span></i> <i><span style="">Papapat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The vampires were skilled in hand to hand combat or swordsmanship, depending on their strength and agility.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They aimed magic towards Vantner who was struggling to block the attacks with his shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cripple!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Dark Binding!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Neder’s Grab!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Various curse magic lowered Vantner’s magic resistance and his body was restrained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His limbs were caught by hands of darkness.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The vampires’ swords aimed at his weak points.&nbsp;</span><span style="">One greedy vampire even used his fangs.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner screamed as his neck was bitten and he was stabbed through the armor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Vantner felt a sense of hopelessness.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If his health fell to the bottom when there was no healer, it was likely he would have to use his one-time invincible skill, ‘Guardian’s Power.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he needed to save this for Elfin Stone’s reappearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shit! Do something!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner shouted as vampires constantly approached him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His colleagues responded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You are doing well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It will be over soon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon, Regas, Faker, and Peak Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Once all of the vampires were focused on Vantner, the four of them succeeded in efficiently killing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The vampires were taken by surprise and received fatal damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuhak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You dare! These humans!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The wounded vampires then shifted their gaze to the four people and said,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The main character is here. Ah, should I say heroine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Unlike the lower part of the stairway that was like hell, the upper part was tranquil.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka unabashedly exposed her sensual body and pulled her bowstring.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Dozens of arrows soared into the air like missiles.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was once again a perfect surprise attack on the vampires defending against the onslaught of the four people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a flood of fire and blood.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The silent and dark interior of the building quickly heated up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The vampires struggling in the sea of fire now had 60% health left.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Finally, it was the turn of the protagonist.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“My Lord! Now!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your morale has increased.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your attack power and magic attack power will significantly rise for the next attack.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The next attack will be a critical hit!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi used the strongest buff on Grid. Grid</span><span style="">&nbsp;withdrew from the party in order to monopolize the experience, took the experience buff potion and put on the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He used Blacksmith's Rage and started his sword dance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Who said that dark spaces limited abilities?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, it was quite the opposite.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuoooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">In the darkness, the blue Failure showed its true value. A powerful aura surrounded it and seeped into the area.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the precursor to the strongest wide area skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Transcended Link.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It had risen one level after the Pascal raid, so the power of Transcended Link was incredible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Not only had the number of strikes and the damage increase, it also had a penetration effect.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The blue-black energy blades swallowed everything in its path and attacked the vampires confronting the Overgeared members. Then it passed through the vampires that had just escaped from Zednos’ storm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Holy Light Gloves’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘5 Joint Attacks’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 5,490,500 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 5,670,000 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt...]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">..</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[This is a phenomenal record!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt over 100 million total damage in 5 seconds!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Reputation throughout the continent will rise by +5,000.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had to make 10 legendary items to get this much reputation!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have recovered five draws of the machine!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an unexpected massive revenue.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kiyaaaaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Keooook!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The building echoed with screams.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most of the 200 vampires were seriously injured and trembled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The important thing was to increase his experience!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid jumped from the stairs into the center of the vampires and used Wave.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kurururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The waves of energy stretched over all the vampires, dealing a huge blow and slowing them down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will take your blood!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The vampires were provoked and only focused on Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At first glance, it seemed dangerous.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the Overgeared members couldn’t help Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was a concern that they would be judged to deal more damage, greatly reducing the amount of experience gained by Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your attack has missed.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid showed a puzzled reaction.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The vampires changed their bodies to black smoke, so all his skills and attacks missed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The momentum of the vampires rose.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuhahahaha! I’m not someone who can be killed by a human!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Your attacks can no longer harm us!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Shaaaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The black smoke moved like a hurricane around Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Once Grid was confused, they planned to use the blood transfusion skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But it was impossible for their plan to be realized.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Go around once.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid issued a command to someone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe? Randy?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had no intention of sharing his experience with the children.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid issued the command to Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Heok!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Rebecca artifact that was the antithesis of all beings with dark power!&nbsp;</span><span style="">The power of the reproduction was weaker than the original, but it was enough to turn the vampires back to their bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"U-Unbelievable!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The vampires weren’t able to move properly. They were in a severely wounded state and influence by the divine power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid looked at their forms that had lost their arrogance, as they crawled on the floor and tried to escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuhahahahat! These lovely guys!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The strongest boss, Elfin Stone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was so happy about the experience in front of him that he forgot about Elfin Stone’s existence.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The blue greatsword killed a vampire every time it moved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Of course, the vampires didn’t stay still. They tried to attack. But Jishuka and Zednos interrupted using arrows and magic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pon, Regas, Faker and Peak Sword blocked any methods of retreat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The current Grid was on a bus from a huge conglomerate. No, he was on a comfortable plane.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The destination was level 300.</span></p>
