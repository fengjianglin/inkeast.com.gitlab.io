 <p><span style="">Chapter 317</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sigh... It is hard, hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It is too hard to fill the quota. Does it make sense that there are only 400 people working in these vast fields? Looking at the scale, there should be at least 10 times more workers.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dammit! If this is an agricultural city, increase the number of farmers!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"They want to save money on the labor costs. I heard that Grid is quite cheap.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“He’s beyond the level of cheap. Cutting labor costs and kidnapping users to become farmers, is this something normal people would do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 21 users caught by Piaro and forced to work.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They complained about Grid every time they gathered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because they were convinced that Piaro, who kidnapped them and turned them into farmers, was doing it under Grid’s orders.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, the reason they didn’t run away was due to the rewards of the hidden quest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Honestly, they were happy about getting a hidden quest and didn’t hold any animosity towards Grid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reason they came to Reidan was because they wanted to join Overgeared, and they basically liked Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But the work was too hard, so it was hard to survive unless they complained. It was inevitable that Grid would be frequently mentioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Are they new?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The grumbling users working in the fields focused on one place.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From far away, Piaro was leading five people over.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This time it’s a group of five.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Tsk tsk, poor guys.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The average level of the 21 users was 270. They had to be at least that level to cross the desert to Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The group of five people would also be high level users.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wasn’t it too absurd that they were being dragged as dogs to become farmers? They felt a sense of compassion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The users looking at the five newcomers sympathetically became confused.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were the master of the Giant Guild and the Five Captains!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“T-This is ridiculous!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were dealt a big blow in the golem invasion, but they were still very strong. The Giant Guild was one of the best guilds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, the Five Captains were third advancement users and Chris was 3rd on the unified rankings, so they were a high sky for the users.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But they weren’t even Piaro’s opponent?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘That crazy farmer is bigger than we thought!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The users were astonished, while Piaro introduced Chris’ group to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"They are new farmers. I hope you get along well with them in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Who is a farmer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Damn bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris, the 3rd ranked user, leader of the Giant Guild and viscount of the Eternal Kingdom was being introduced as a new farmer!&nbsp;</span><span style="">The captains trembled at Piaro’s absurd attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Chris wasn’t offended.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The opponent was stronger than him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Despite being able to kill him, Chris was spared and given a hidden quest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t intend to make a fuss.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let's get along well."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris greeted the senior farmers with respect.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Five Captains were forced to bow their heads.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"W-We will work hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On this day, Chris and the Five Captains joined the fun and exciting training.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A strange rumor started to circulate on the Internet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The master of the Giant Guild and the Five Captains became serfs of Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a rumor that couldn’t be believed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No one believed the rumor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this nonsense?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was more disbelieving than anyone else.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had obtained 27 pavranium for helping with Braham’s resurrection.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Originally, there were 28 pavranium. However, one of them became the Vessel of the Soul and entered Braham’s possession.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is painful that I can’t get one, but...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Fortunately, all 27 out of 27 pavranium had the blessing of the four gods.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As the master of the pavranium, Grid received a 15% buff on his attack power, defense, recovery and magic power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a legendary class exclusive item, the pavranium was truly a scam.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It was only because of Braham that I could receive the blessing of God Yatan, so let’s not think too much about giving him one pavranium.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had become a very positive and generous person compared to the past. In fact, a little while ago, he had reduced Chris’ repair price by 2 gold.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘2 gold is two ramyun.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He could imagine how much Chris appreciated it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid didn’t doubt that Chris would feel a great affection towards him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He thought about a future alliance with the Giant Guild, then wondered what he should do with the pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can’t make Lifael’s Spear.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lifael’s Spear was the strongest weapon in existence. It was an undeniable truth. Unfortunately, it was an inefficient weapon for Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The spear wasn’t influenced by Pagma’s Swordsmanship and he was poisoned by its divine power when he used Blackening.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is enough to have Grid’s Greatsword, Failure, and Yakult as weapons.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then would it be better to make armor?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was equipped with the Holy Light armor, gloves and a crown that were made by Pagma, and they boasted an outstanding performance when worn as a set. He also efficiently swapped between Grid’s Boots and Braham’s Boots for the shoes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, he was lacking a shield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid used a greatsword as a weapon, so there weren’t many opportunities to use a shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is there anything special that isn’t a weapon or armor?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pavranium was a mineral with its own will.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It considered Grid’s safety as the top priority and moved with its own judgment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was far more efficient to give it freedom than to limit it to his body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What was the best type of item to utilize that freedom?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A symbol of freedom...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Snack."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...It is a snack. Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Snack?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Who was the person who suddenly interfered with his deep thoughts by speaking nonsense?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid shifted his gaze in that direction.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The guy who had devoted himself to monster hunting since arriving in Reidan was now resting on the window sill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Give me a snack! Give it to me! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had a very proud and arrogant attitude. It was almost a command.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Have you lost your senses? No, in the first place, why are you after a snack? Don’t you eat monster or human souls?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That is food! Snacks are snacks, nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What jerk gave you the concept of snacks…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Your wife! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Setting aside where he learnt the word ‘wife,’ he was talking about Irene.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I heard that Irene has a hobby of baking cake these days.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Irene was the daughter of an earl, so she never learned how to cook.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now after coming to Reidan, she wanted to learn how to cook and bake, so that she could give Grid a little joy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thanks to her, the Overgeared members and the soldiers were able to enjoy sweet snacks. Noe seemed to have been added as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sigh, okay. Take a nap and don’t interfere with my work."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid decided to ignore Noe and started thinking again about what to make with the pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘An item that can highlight the advantage of moving on its own...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Teddy bear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...A teddy bear is good... Ah, you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Teddy bear?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Who was interfering this time?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The incensed Grid turned towards the owner of the voice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Randy, who was in the appearance of a little girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I received a teddy bear from Irene!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Randy was pure and cute as she extended the bear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid nodded roughly towards the child.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay. Go and play with the teddy bear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Randy smiled and went next to Noe to play with the bear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But her playing didn’t last long.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Noe teased Randy by repeatedly batting at the teddy bear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...I'm going crazy."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Randy started crying while Noe laughed, interrupting Grid’s meditation time. So he kicked them out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he wondered again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The item I should make out of pavranium...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Please make farming equipment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...The answer is farming equipment... Hah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s face distorted like a demon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Farming equipment?&nbsp;</span><span style="">This time, someone was pouring cold water on him!&nbsp;</span><span style="">The owner of the voice was Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro was wearing dirt-stained clothing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid could no longer overlook it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Piaro, what is your job?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I am the leader of the Overgeared Knights Division, commander of Reidan, and a farmer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Isn’t there something strange in there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid couldn’t understand it at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why on earth do you keep clinging to being a farmer? Are you doing your duties as knight captain and commander of Reidan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro answered without hesitation. He felt pride in his responsibilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Then I'm glad. But what about your goal of becoming a sword saint? If you don’t have time due to your duties, isn’t it better to quit farming and practice your swordsmanship?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[A legendary farmer has been born!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The main character of the notification window that all users in Satisfy saw wasn’t Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was certain, but he couldn’t help feeling nervous.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In this case, his uneasy feeling was proven correct.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I realized that I am a farmer, not a sword saint.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was no longer a fool.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro was faithful to his role as a farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was rumored that the seven guilds’ invasion of Reidan was repelled by farmers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The users doing field work, and so on.&nbsp;</span><span style="">All of these things attested to the fact that Piaro was the legendary farmer. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid just didn’t want to admit it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sword Saint Muller.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid hoped that Piaro’s strength would be recognized as the strongest among the legends.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...Is it because your talent isn’t enough to pursue the peak of swordsmanship? In the end, you gave up and became a farmer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid couldn’t hide his anger as he tried to provoke Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro knew the role that Grid wanted for him. He knew the sense of loss that Grid would be feeling.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro was determined to prove himself to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would prove that he was superior compared to when he was a great swordsman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Farming is the foundation of our lives and it is more valuable than anything else in the world. I just chose a more valuable path.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It is possible for women to harvest the crops. You aren’t the only one who can do farming."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"However, I’m the only one who can master it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why do you need to master farming? Ah, to create a good harvest? It is very minor. If you have power, you can occupy more territory. Then there would be more people and we can secure a large amount of food using it. It is much more profitable to develop the armed forces to aim for more land.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Mastering farming isn’t merely raising crops. I can exert more power if I have an understanding of nature. I can confident that I am necessary for My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Really? Then prove it. What type of power can a farmer exert?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was what Piaro wanted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had been wanting this situation since he asked for farming equipment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I must be acknowledged by My Lord.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He would let Grid know the greatness of a farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro took out his hand plow and plow, while Grid armed himself with Failure and Grid’s Greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will return you to your original form. Your hands are meant to hold a sword, not dirt-stained farming equipment!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At present, Piaro wasn’t sane. Grid had to return him to the right path.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid put on the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch and used Blacksmith’s Rage to overpower Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro made a sad expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘His talent is weak compared to Kraugel and Chris.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid made great strides after defeating Pagma’s Doppelganger, but his lord was fundamentally unskilled. It was unlikely that his growth had continued since then.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘You might be poisoned with frustration after losing, but I believe that you can overcome this poison as usual.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Piaro would first relieve his burden by proving his value.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Piaro judged and blocked the blue greatsword Grid was swinging, then counterattacked while avoiding a dark blue greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In his head, Grid had already collapsed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But what was Grid’s specialty?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the power to overcome common sense and destroy predictions.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As soon as the blue greatsword and hand plow collided, Piaro’s eyes widened.</span></p>
