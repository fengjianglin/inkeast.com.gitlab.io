 <p><span style="">Chapter 399</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid? Certainly, he has grown. I was impressed when I saw the Eternal Kingdom war video.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The strongest nation in Satisfy, the USA.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thousands of people gathered at a press conference for Zibal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The theme of the interview was the 2nd National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, most of the questions were about Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“In the past, Grid played while relying on his items, skills, and stats. Now he has combined it with moderate control skills. Considering his talents, I guess it’s a result of his efforts. I admire his efforts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You described Grid’s control as ‘moderate.’ Are you saying that it isn’t at an amazing level?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Well... Isn’t it good enough from the public’s point of view?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Then he hasn’t reached the level of high rankers yet. It’s said that Grid’s power will be weakened in the National Competition due to the patch. How do you see it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I also have the same opinion. If it wasn’t for Grid’s items and stats... He will be very ordinary.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I have a question about that. Is Grid really weak? If his damage has been halved, can’t Grid overwhelm the opponent in two blows instead of one?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reporter’s question caused all the people in the room to laugh, including Zibal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reporter’s question was very rudimentary.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Zibal stopped laughing and opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Satisfy’s stats aren’t just attack power and health. Isn’t there also the concept of defense? For example, let’s say my defense is 100 and Grid’s attack power is 1,000. How much damage will I get if I am attacked by Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Isn’t it 900?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The old and retired reporter didn’t know much about Satisfy. He was out of date, and in fact, he hadn’t even been intending to attend this press conference.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But a sudden mishap occurred and he attended on behalf of his junior.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Zibal saw that he was a layman and kindly explained.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No, that isn’t it. A formula is applied to defense. First of all, besides the defense that can be found in the stats window, every class has a unique resistance that is additionally added to defense to reduce the enemy damage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“In other words, this patch will reduce Grid’s attack power by more than 50%?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Then isn’t this patch fatal to other players with low attack power, not just Grid? How will you cause damage to each other?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reporter continued to ask basic questions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Zibal shook his head and pointed to his head and heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It is to attack the enemy’s weak points. Be faster and more accurate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Grid didn’t have that type of skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The old reporter finally understood and sat down to take notes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Other reporters’ questions followed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Now that Grid’s influence in PvP has weakened, what is your prediction for South Korea’s overall ranking?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“22nd? As you know, there isn’t any other talent in South Korea besides Yura. There will be a limit to her alone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What about Peak Sword?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Of course, Peak Sword is excellent. But his attack mode is one strike. It’s very powerful, but the delay after each attack is long. He’s also one of the victims of this patch. South Korea is tragic in many ways.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What about Russia and Kraugel?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Russia has some great participants and Kraugel is the only competitor I admire... They can easily enter the top 10.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What about the host, France?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“They can get at least in the top 5.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The United States?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Of course, we will be 1st. As always, in all areas.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Beijing, China.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hao. You didn’t participate in the 1st National Competition held in South Korea last year. Because of that, China was forced to stay in 7th place. The reason you expressed your intention to participate in this National Competition is to sooth the disappointment of our Chinese people, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao kept his 16th ranking despite the Overgeared members causing a cataclysm in the unified rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The miracle of their country was known as a genius of fighting.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Whether it was a solo exhibition or team play, he boasted overwhelming stats in PvP.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Last year, Hao’s vacancy was huge for China, who couldn’t achieve remarkable results in PvP related events.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He felt cynical towards the reporters’ questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I want to say that it has no relation to the hearts of the people.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao was a Chinese person, so he knew them well.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If he made a slip of the tongue, he could be kidnapped one day.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao took a deep breath and nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That’s correct. Last year, I didn’t participate in the National Competition due to personal circumstances and deeply regretted it. I swear before the spirit of the great Mao Zedong and China, I will lead our country to victory in this National Competition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Last year, Grid and South Korea interfered with China and rose to the 3rd spot. Now that Grid has been nerfed, will you be able to repay the past disgrace?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">According to Lauel, Grid was someone beyond Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would dismiss it as nonsense, but Lauel wasn’t someone to exaggerate. It was clear that Grid had something.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can’t say anything good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao looked around the room.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reporters were staring with expectations in their eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hao sighed and eventually opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Whether Grid is nerfed or not, he wasn’t my opponent in the first place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reporters got the answer they wanted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was natural for the people of a great country to win over those of a small country.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Snap!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Snap snap!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Hao’s remarks were written on Internet articles as photos were taken of him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Meanwhile, Hao sipped his cold water.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It isn’t a lie.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The only one better than him was Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hao had a high evaluation of his own skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because he was able to tie up the feet of several Overgeared members alone during the Reidan invasion.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Paris. France.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Bondre, you experienced a humiliating defeat after being logged out by Grid in just 4 seconds. Did that incident cause trauma? Will you be able to participate well in the National Competition?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">France was a strong favorite in the 1st National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Surprisingly, many experts analyzed that France would win over the United States.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But France’s greatest player, Bondre, was torn apart by Grid and everything became a tangled mess.&nbsp;</span><span style="">France narrowly settled for second place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bondre scoffed at the reporters’ malicious question and made a scathing remark.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Trauma? That’s something that will happen to hyenas like you. I am a beast of prey. I will never shrink back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Your confidence is good. But isn’t this patch fatal for you? Your Absolute Zero won’t be able to function properly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">France was the host country of the 2nd National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As the host country, the entire nation was hoping for them to win.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the public didn’t trust Bondre.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Bondre ridiculed the reporter’s question.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You still think that Absolute Zero is my only skill?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A year has passed since the first National Competition. In the meantime, I have learned many powerful spells. In the first place, an ice mystic specializes in defense and utility rather than high attack power. This patch is just giving me wings."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bondre was so angry that he spoke in informal language.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He declared to the dozens of media outlets gathered in this place,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Those uncivilized Koreans who eat dog meat, I will shatter them. Then your attitude towards me will change. I will lead France to victory.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Ottawa, Canada.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">3rd ranked Chris was also holding a press conference.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Last year, Canada was one of the strong candidates to win the National Competition. But we had to experience the shocking result of not being able to enter the top 3.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This year, the country is hoping for a different result. Chris, do you have the confidence to revive people’s expectations?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Please provide a satisfying answer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris read the words in the reporters’ eyes and bowed his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Last year, I was helpless. I lost to Zibal in the boss raid, was defeated by Bondre in the labyrinth breakthrough, and was defeated by Regas in PvP. I want to borrow this place to once again apologize.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In fact, Chris shouldn’t have to apologize.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Last year, Chris was very cool.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He won the silver medal in the boss raid and labyrinth breakthrough, and reached the quarter-finals in PvP.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris struggled against the best players of the world alone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Lift your head!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You’re our hero!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reporters cried out, causing Chris to slowly raise his head. Then he smiled at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will try to show a better performance this year. I am confident of winning against all opponents except for Kraugel and Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“G-Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reporters were startled.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wasn’t Grid a victim of the patch?&nbsp;</span><span style="">At this moment, rankers and experts from all over the world were evaluating that Grid would find it hard to play a big role in the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why did Chris see Grid as superior to him?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Chris is also a victim of the patch, but...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Chris has much higher skills when it comes to the greatsword. He is different from Grid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chris laughed at the reporters faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can’t easily beat Grid, who competed with the crazy farmer for a long time.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The world didn’t know Grid’s true value.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chris couldn’t comprehend the public opinion, who ridiculed Grid despite all his achievements just because of his normal control.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Of course, this didn’t mean Chris was already obsessed with defeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid and Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Both men weren’t easy to beat, but Chris didn’t think there was no chance at all.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the pride of the 3rd ranked user.</span></p>
