 <p><span style="">Chapter 240</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Satisfy had some areas that were completely different from reality. If a user had a child in Satisfy, there could be various problems.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were too many risk factors, such as neglecting reality by being too immersed in the child in the game or ignoring the child in the game because they were too busy playing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Only those who had established mature values were eligible to enjoy Satisfy’s parenting system.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Can I really do well?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Grid of the past would’ve said okay without thinking about it. But the current Grid realized the seriousness of the situation. He thought carefully about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was still too immature to be a parent. But he wanted Irene to be happy. She was one of the most precious people to him, despite being a person in virtual reality. Thanks to her, he learned how to love. Grid wanted to make her dream come true. He didn’t want her to be disappointed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I also want the result of the love that I share with Irene.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After a few hours of deliberation, Grid made a decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I am grateful for the news of the pregnancy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The notification windows immediately blinked and responded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Congratulations on your wife’s pregnancy!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The preferences and abilities of the child will be affected from prenatal development.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[What type of child do you want? The child you want and the child your wife wants will affect prenatal development. Work hard to communicate with your wife.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I wish my child...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t that hard to imagine.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Someone different from me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He didn’t want them to be petty or stupid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had no talent and was narrow-minded, so he hoped that his own child wouldn’t experience such an unfortunate life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I want someone who resembles my wife, a child who is bright, generous, and pretty. First of all, I wish for a clever child to be born. Congratulations on your pregnancy. And thank you.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid wrote it in the letter to Irene. It was difficult to find traces of his childhood in his careful expression.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid would turn 28 years old in five months in real time. He was becoming a true adult with this pregnancy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Taemyeong means ‘fortune’ in the sense of a jackpot...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was no question that he still had no naming sense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even so, it was fortunate that he only thought about Taemyeong.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">A regular board meeting held at the head office of the S.A. Group.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The main agenda of the meeting was to set the budget for the Second National Competition to be held in Paris next year.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At the end of the meeting, one member was brought up. Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It’s actually Grid again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Isn’t the parenting system only activated for mature players?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The executives heard the report from the operations team leader and expressed their anxiety.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Recently, Grid was conducting himself as a legendary class, but the prejudice didn’t easily disappear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The executives had been watching Grid from the beginning and still saw him as that. Now he would have a child with an NPC? Just imagining it was terrible. They were worried about the worst situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"He will raise a child? This is ridiculous!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Games had implemented a parenting system many times in the past. There was even a separate child raising simulation game. A typical example was Princess Mama.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Such games didn’t make users feel any responsibility. Users could delete their child or neglect them. Such an act didn’t cause any moral issues either.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The characters in a typical game were nothing more than 2D characters that acted and talked according to a given scenario.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then what about the characters in Satisfy?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The supercomputer Morpheus gave all Satisfy NPCs the perfect artificial intelligence. As a result, NPCs had thoughts and emotions. They were no different from humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was only a matter of time until an immature user experienced the parenting system. If the users neglected or abused their children in the game, the creators couldn’t rule out the possibility of social problems.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The parenting system was a double-edged sword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Satisfy’s game would be better if used well, but public opinion would take a hit if it was exploited.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The development team arranged the parenting system so that only a very small number of users could experience it. It was based on the fact that the married couple’s liking was at the maximum, and the parenting system was designed to be activated only for users who had maximum respect for NPCs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Grid?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The person who sent malicious emails to the group when he couldn’t make legendary items was selected for the parenting system!&nbsp;</span><span style="">The executives were convinced that there was clearly an error. They couldn’t tolerate it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A surprising figure emerged to defend Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Director Yoon Sangmin.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the past, he had a tendency to hate Grid more than anyone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Don’t you know about the recent Grid? He has grown. He’s different form the past. So don’t worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“We all know that his abilities have grown. Didn’t he win three gold medals and save the kingdom from the golem army? What we are pointing out is a personality matter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"He has grown up personally.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was Director Yoon Sangmin.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The executives frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"How do you know that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You will quickly notice if you show a little interest and watch him.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s inner growth was something that could be seen just from his actions.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“In the first place, the system chooses. This means that Grid is qualified, so there is no room to negotiate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cough...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The executives stared dumbly.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="">Director Yoon Sangmin, who calmed the turmoil, was very interested in Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘A human who learns and develops through the game.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A typical human became an adult by learning and experiencing society. Then they had a tendency to spill out all their stress in games. There were many reasons why good humans in society would become notorious villains in games.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Grid was a special case.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He lacked social skills, but was growing through the game.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a good example of a Satisfy user and could be used as a means of publicity. Of course, that was under the assumption that Grid accepted.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">"Shit!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The atmosphere of the White Wolf guild wasn’t great.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They failed their quest because of an unexpected person, and their pride was hurt because one person wiped out the whole guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Veradin encouraged the resentful and frustrated guild members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don't mind it. Grid is the best. It isn’t a shame to be defeated by him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">As the first ranked Kraugel maintained an air of mystery around him, Grid had to be rated as the strongest for the moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was underestimated by the public because of his lacking control, but that wasn’t necessarily true. No, it was great.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As Veradin said, it wasn’t shameful for their small guild to be defeated by Grid, who was at the top. This was the obvious result.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, the guild members were worried about Veradin.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A month ago, Veradin had cleared a S+ grade quest and acquired the bones of the high ranking demonkin, Dantalian. In the battle against Grid, he had summoned the undead Dantalian using the bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was his trump card. Even Grid showed worry.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Veradin was strong as long as he had Dantalian. It was amazing that he managed to annoy Grid for a while, despite not reaching level 300 yet. Veradin clearly demonstrated his abilities that were above his ranking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The problem was that the guild members were weak. They weren’t a help to Veradin at all.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were sorry to see Veradin dragged down because of useless subordinates. They couldn’t lift their heads.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In this sober atmosphere, Kiki threw out a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"But Veradin, why didn’t you report Grid to Earl Zebra?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was a duke of the Eternal Kingdom. It was a big problem if he was in the territory of the empire.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If this was reported to the upper ranks, Grid would surely experience large problems. Veradin held a key for revenge, so Kiki wondered why he didn’t use it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It isn’t time yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Veradin answered vaguely and Kiki realized that he was thinking about a bigger picture.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The last time that Kraugel visited the western part of the Eternal Kingdom was eight months ago.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that time, the west was completely a desert and it was infested with monsters. If he took a step, he would be confronted with monsters. If he moved a little bit, he would be completely isolated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But now the situation had changed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The scale of the desert was reduced and there were less monsters than before. It had turned into more ideal hunting grounds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kraugel speculated that Grid had destroyed several giant worm nests after becoming lord of Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel had to admire it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Grid is greater than the rumors say. After absorbing the Tzedakah Guild, he’s quickly growing his power.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel also knew about Grid. He was a celebrity that most people in the world knew.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he hadn’t paid Grid any special attention.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kraugel devoted himself entirely to adventuring and hunting, while Grid participated in external events and was judged to be a completely different style of user.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He didn’t care because he didn’t think he would become involved with Grid in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘My inventory weight is at its limit. Is Reidan the only well-equipped city or village near here?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the last 10 days, Kraugel had killed the western monsters while heading for Reidan. It wasn’t to meet Grid, but to dispose of his loot.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It’s an agricultural city.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kraugel arrived at REidan and admired the cast fields of wheat stretching out. He never imagined that a city in the middle of the desert would’ve developed agriculture.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘He was successful in clearing the desert and has an excellent ability in managing affairs.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid showed great strength in the National Competition and in the golem army, but he was skilled in other areas as well.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a legendary blacksmith, had top rankers as subordinates and even had great skills as a lord?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was truly a near-perfect figure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Zibal isn’t equipped with things like this. The first user to become king might be Grid, not Zibal.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Did Kraugel have any regrets?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Kraugel was the type of person who enjoyed playing the game alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He perceived that his areas of activities were completely different from Grid’s. Therefore, he didn’t have a sense of crisis or competitiveness towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Step, step.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Kraugel was crossing the fields to enter Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that time, an NPC holding a rake in one hand and a hoe in the other appeared and asked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Who are you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...?”</span></p>
