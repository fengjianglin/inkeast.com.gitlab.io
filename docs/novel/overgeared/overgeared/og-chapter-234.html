 <p><span style="">Chapter 234</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">After restoring the proper amount of stamina.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid barely managed to sit up on a flat piece of rock.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He noticed the eyes of the Overgeared members looking at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The atmosphere has changed.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was it because he overcame this big trial by surpassing his limit several times over?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid felt like he had achieved excellent personal growth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid shared the item information with the Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Guardian’s Necklace]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Unique (Set)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 23/23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 35</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Indomitable +30</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When the set is worn: Defense +100</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When the set is worn: Indomitable +50</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A necklace manifested by the Doppelganger of the Mysterious Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It gives the wearer a strong willpower and defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 300 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 15</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Guardian’s Bracelet]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Unique (Set)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 21/21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 37</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Indomitable +30</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When the set is worn: Defense +100</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When the set is worn: Indomitable +50</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A bracelet manifested by the Doppelganger of the Mysterious Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It gives the wearer a strong willpower and defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 300 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 11</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Oh, it’ a magic accessory?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes. Defense is attached to an accessory?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Most accessories didn’t have much defense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">For example, while Doran’s Ring could exert tremendous healing ability equivalent to a legendary rating, it didn’t give even one point of defense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, the Guardian’s Necklace and Bracelet both had extremely high defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘With the set effect, they increase defense by 172 points...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was comparable to a level 300 heavy gauntlets or heavy boots of the normal rating.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was amazing that these two accessories gave such high defense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the members weren’t happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Just high defense? They don’t have any options.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes. An accessory should at least have some attribute resistance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I need accessories that decrease cooldown time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It raises the indomitable stat, but the stat itself isn’t all that great.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Indomitable]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Has a certain probability of invalidating a portion of the incoming damage. The lower the health, the higher the probability.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The higher the number, the higher the effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Stat points can’t be distributed to this stat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">According to the stated description, Indomitable was a very useful special stat. In particular, it was an essential stat for tankers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, because the probability of the stat’s effect being activated was extremely low, people treated ‘indomitable’ as a trash stat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was more familiar with this than anyone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The indomitable stat really is trash.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid currently had close to 900 points in Indomitable.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Despite this fact, he never experienced the indomitable effect.&nbsp;</span><span style="">These were the only accessories that a strong boss monster dropped?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members were disappointed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Grid was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If you guys don’t mind, I would like to use these accessories.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After he became Pagma's Descendant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had been self-sufficient regarding items through production and raids.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, accessories weren’t an area that blacksmiths could produce and because boss monsters didn’t often drop them, Grid didn’t have any.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I couldn’t find someone who could handle the purple orichalcum...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">From Grid’s perspective, he was grateful even for the Guardian accessory set.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members unconditionally agreed to Grid’s request.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid, you should do what you want.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You are the first place in this raid. It is natural for you to have what you want.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid expressed his gratitude and shared the information of the greatsword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Doppelganger’s Greatsword]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Legendary</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 731/731 &nbsp;Attack Power: 780~1,516</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Attack Speed: -6%&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Ignores 20% of the enemy’s defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Increases the power of attack skills by 20%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A greatsword that the Doppelganger of the Mysterious Forest copied.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It imitated the work of the legendary blacksmith Pagma, but the resemblance is only in the appearance. The power isn’t comparable to Pagma’s works.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 320 or higher. More than 2,010 strength. Advanced Sword Mastery level 2 or higher.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 3,955</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It is terrific!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was overwhelming performance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members let out sounds of admiration.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was also impressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It is at this level, despite not being comparable to Pagma’s work?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The damage was slightly less than the unique rated Failure, but the options of the greatsword showed other advantages.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, the 20% increase in attack skills damage captivated Grid’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If I use this greatsword, Pagma’s Swordsmanship will be greatly strengthened...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Of course, it wasn’t a weapon good enough to replace Failure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It meant it wasn’t suitable for Grid to use.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members were also similar.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It is a pity that it’s a greatsword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It would’ve been nice if it was a one-handed weapon...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No one used the greatsword as a weapon among the Overgeared members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Beast Master Toon could handle a greatsword, but his primary weapon was a wrist blade.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Both Grid and the Overgeared members felt regret.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why don’t you try challenging the two sword style?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel suggested.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Two sword style? Dual swordsmanship?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Some swordsmen classes acquired a passive skill called the ‘Two Sword Style’, where they used two swords instead of a shield and boasted powerful attacks and dazzling attack orbits.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“He doesn’t have the skill called Two Sword Style... But it shouldn’t be a problem?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As Pagma’s Descendant, Grid could handle all weapons regardless of whether he had the required weapon mastery skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members knew this fact.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid thought negatively.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"How can I do dual swordsmanship with a greatsword...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The weight wasn’t a problem.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s strength stat was unrivaled. Failure was light by default, but he could swing the relatively heavy Doppelganger’s Greatword with one hand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there was a problem.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Both Failure and the Doppelganger’s Greatsword had a length of 2m.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wouldn’t be easy to wield two weapons longer than his height at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel persuaded Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Your control skills have increased by leaps and bounds during this raid. It is more than you can imagine yourself. I am confident that if you try hard and don’t give up, I am convinced that you can do it. Besides, don’t you have a great mentor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel pointed towards Piaro and said, </span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Toon uses two wrist blades and Piaro is the strongest swordsman. If you study with them, won’t you be able to master the Two Sword Style someday?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Umm...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Certainly, it was a tempting suggestion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Doppelganger’s Greatsword increased basic damage and skills damage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">By taking advantage of the two weapons and using Pagma’s Swordsmanship, he would be able to achieve a much higher attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I want to challenge it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His blood was boiling.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there was a problem.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Doppelganger’s Greatsword was an item obtained in a raid group with the Overgeared members. He couldn’t take all the items alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid hesitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Do as Lauel says.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right. It is a good idea. Grid, can’t you use any weapon without limit? You should take advantage of this advantage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You will raise your defense with the accessories, so it’s ideal if you can increase your attack power.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Everyone...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They were generously giving it to me.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Were they doing him a favor?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Grid in the past would’ve giggled and accepted it without any conflicts. But now he was different. He had something called a conscience.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members encouraged him when he hesitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"In the first place, you are the only one who can use a greatsword. Should we sell it to others for money? Absolutely not. I don’t want a ranker getting their hands on a powerful weapon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right, should we raise a rival with our own hands?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“In addition, we owe a lot to Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After he became the master of the Overgeared Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid produced the guild members’ items for free.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He thought it was something he should do as the guild master.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was always thankful to the Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now that favor was returning to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Thank you...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Doppelganger’s Greatsword was worth at least three million gold.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was thrilled by the Overgeared members’ actions.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“It is extremely difficult to adapt to using two swords in a short period of time. In particular, it is theoretically impossible to master dual wielding with greatswords.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Do you mean I should give up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No, that isn’t it. It is possible to overcome it with Pagma’s power. But it will take time. First of all, don’t fret. I will try to train you so that you can use dual swords with Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid and the Overgeared members passed through the Mysterious Forest and climbed the mountain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was to search for the presence of a mine.&nbsp;</span><span style="">While they were moving, Grid discussed how to dual wield with Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi was walking ahead and he shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There is a small cabin on the slopes of the mountain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A cabin?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A person lived in a dangerous area where no one could enter because of the doppelganger?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid and the Overgeared members were curious but didn’t forget their boundaries. They knocked on the door of the cabin.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is anyone here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was no answer. There were also no sounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Should we enter?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner wasn’t sure if there was a landlord present, but he opened the old door.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the smell of mold tormented the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This house has been neglected for at least a decade.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s group started to search the house. However, there was nothing in the house except for a small bed and desk.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh? What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner discovered an old storage box.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was made of birch and locked like a treasure chest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What was inside?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Vantner was curious and tried to break the box.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the system rejected it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Nothing happened.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This... It looks like we need a key to open the box?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Leave it to me."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid came forward.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He pulled out his ‘Master Key.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Clink.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The rusty lock was opened with no resistance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a small book in the storage box.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid opened it.</span></p>
