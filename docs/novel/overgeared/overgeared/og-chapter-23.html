 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Hey, Old Man! You still haven’t decided? Will you hand this building over to us? Then won’t you be able to buy alcohol every day until you die?”</p>
 <p><span style="">The men who entered the smithy were rough looking and their physique was good. They reminded me of the employees from Mother's Heart is Happy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They took a heavy-handed attitude as they handed a sheet of paper to the elderly blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What’s this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a contract to sell this building and the land to the Mero Company.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I instinctively realized it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If I analyze this based on my recent successes and troubles, it’s likely that I’ll get involved in a stupid quest as I stand here.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That absolutely couldn’t be allowed to happen.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The urgent thing right now was to earn money by making items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There’s no time to waste on unwanted quests.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I admired my brain’s quick thinking and moved to avoid this situation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But how many things ever went according to my will?&nbsp;</span><span style="">I only managed to move a few steps before I was caught by the gangsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hey, where did this newbie come from? You trying to sneak into our business like a rat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They started to question me in an intimidating manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Did you come to steal the contents of our contract? You, are you a spy? Did the Skaner Company send you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why did I get caught up in the contents of that piece of paper? This was really some useless curiosity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I should’ve just stayed in the rear and avoided looking at them.'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I shrugged as if to say ‘Spy, me? What are you talking about? It isn’t like that, so don’t worry about me. I just want to go my own way.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But they continued to act tough.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Gulp.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Damn.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My saliva dried up and sweat beaded up on my forehead.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I remembered my low-level days in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was it due to the fearful memories of being a bread shuttle, or being threatened by teenage gangster NPCs in the back alleys? Or maybe it was because they resembled the employees from Mother's Heart is Happy Financial Services.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I reflexively shrank back from the group; I couldn’t cope with this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I should behave.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Violent NPCs didn’t fear the law. It was entirely possible to be severely injured or killed if I even so much as touched these guys.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Of course, I could report the NPCs to the guards, but their fists were closer than the law was.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">It might be possible if I was stronger or quick enough to flee from this building. However, that wasn’t the case so it was better to avoid irritating them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Judging by their appearance and atmosphere, they aren’t back alley bullies. They don’t just smoke cigarettes and use bread shuttles.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Mero Company was the second largest business company in the Eternal Kingdom. They wouldn’t give jobs to losers. These assholes were all gangsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Based on their equipment, they’re at least level 35.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Gangsters over level 35!&nbsp;</span><span style="">How many people have they hurt and frightened in order to level up? I couldn’t imagine all the sins that these people had committed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There are five of them... In contrast, I am only level 3. While my stats are superior compared to those of my level, they’re all still around level 20. Not only that I am alone as well.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">To make matters worse, I was unarmed. I would only lose if I got into a fight with them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Yes, let’s act prudently and discard my pride.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As soon as I organized my thoughts, I smiled as brightly as possible and explained,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I’m not here to spy on you. I am just a customer passing by. So you don’t have to be so vigilant. Heheh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Acting subservient to NPCs! I felt no shame.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The hand of the man holding my shoulder loosened slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Customer? At this smithy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hoh? A customer of this smithy...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The grip of the man’s hand on my shoulder strengthened again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Ouch, it hurts.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I frowned due to the pain. Curse words almost popped out of my mouth, but I remained patient. Instead of scolding him, I tried my best to maintain my smile.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why? Otherwise, I might get hit! There was an old saying that you couldn’t spit when there was a smile on the other person’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The gangsters eyed me with suspicion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The street operated by the Mero Company has a large number of weapons stores, so why would you come to a smithy like this? Isn’t this strange?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There might be many weapons stores, but this is the only smithy. I don’t want to buy a weapon, but instead find a blacksmith for production-related work. Therefore, it was inevitable that I came here. Hehe, I had no idea this smithy was troubled since I am new to Winston.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I could debut as a lead actor right away and would be the perfect candidate for the New Actor Award at the end of year ceremonies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">My appearance and tone were subservient.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I continued to smile and the suspicious gangster released me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I somehow feel like hitting you, but you’re a blacksmith as well? Umm, indeed. You’re so weak that you can’t be a spy... Okay, get out of here. Don’t think about coming here again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Did he want to hit me? Did I look poor and weak? These scum thought they could make fun of me just because of how I looked?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The fury in my heart boiled over.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, be patient.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hehe, thank you for believing in me. I’ll be going now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was able to keep the smile until the last minute as I quickly headed out of the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the old blacksmith’s angry voice was heard behind me,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Yes... there’s nothing to be gained from dragging this dirty work out too long. It is better to avoid such things. I’m too tired now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As I paused for a moment, the old man blinked his bloodshot eyes. It was to stop the tears from falling down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Give me that contract. I’ll sign it as you wish.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Eh? R-Really?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh! Good thinking Old Man!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It took a long time, but you have finally made a wise decision.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The gangsters cheered at the old man’s words. It was like a festival.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The one who seemed to be the leader handed the contract to the old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“All you have to do is sign. Then you can take it easy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The old man gazed at the contract and hesitated for a moment before reaching towards the contract with trembling hands.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that moment, tears fell from the old man’s eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Ahh! This is the end of my seven generation family business! I won’t be able to face my ancestors after death!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The sight of the sad and depressed old man was unbearable.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the gangsters mocked him instead of comforting him,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You abruptly stopped blacksmithing, so isn’t it natural for the customers to turn away? And Old Man, didn’t you have a child? Your only son died, so you turned to the bottles? You don’t have a successor, so once you die, your family line will naturally be cut off. You were defending something that had no value. Didn’t your debts just increase? Pathetic, truly pathetic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You! Don’t mention my son with that vulgar mouth!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why the hell are you so loud? Do you want to be scolded like last time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The gangster called ‘Johnson’ threatened to hit the old man.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was angry when I saw Johnson.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Isn’t that an old man? Not only did he speak rudely to the old man, but threatening to beat him up...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that moment, a gangster called ‘Um’ spoke,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Look, the contract should be completed today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then the one called ‘Praga’ jumped in like an excited foal,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“No, I’m mad. Didn’t we have to wait a few months for the old man to acceptwhile that old man refused? Think about how much we suffered because of him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The gangster called ‘Neil’ continued,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I agree... Fuck, we couldn’t even properly handle an old man. We received less pay on the scheduled date because of this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then the silent leader, ‘Veil’ smiled coldly and said,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“That’s right, you must compensate us for the damages we received.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Veil slapped the old man’s cheek and said,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Hey Old Man, once you receive the money for selling this smithy, half of it will be used to pay off your debt, while the other half will be handed to us. Isn’t it obvious to compensate us for the damages you caused?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You dog bastards!”&nbsp;</span><span style="">The old man, Khan, angrily replied to Veil.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hey, you don’t have a wife or son to feed, so why do you need a large amount of money? You should help the poor, young people like me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My insides were boiling with anger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I don’t respect senior citizens much, but...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">When I used public transportation such as the bus or subway, I never yielded my seat to the elderly.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I paid the same taxes, so I also had the right to enjoy the seat! No matter how burdensome their gazes were, I never gave way.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘But...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I didn’t insult or tease the elderly, unlike these gangsters.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I was really angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Young pups treating grandmothers and grandfathers like this... it is terrible.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">So?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Should I help the old man, despite my low level?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">NO~ NO~ I don’t have a sense of justice. Why should I help others? I couldn’t think of any benefits.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In my childhood, I was disgusted by superheroes instead of admiring them like everyone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why are they getting hurt trying to save others? Are they crazy?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I couldn’t understand the heroes who sacrificed themselves to defeat the villain. My young self cringed as I watched their unconditional sacrifice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">So when the neighborhood kids played as heroes, I acted as the villain. Once I became the villain, I enjoyed the pleasure I got from harassing my friends who played the role of heroes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I showed sense by pretending to die at the end of the game, meaning the other children didn’t feel any resentment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘When I think about it, I have been like this since childhood. Yes, from the beginning, I closed my eyes whenever I saw injustice.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">So I turned away from the old man who was being humiliated and about to lose the business that had been in his family for seven generations.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Sure, some regrets remained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The situation has become like this, so it is impossible to make items in this smithy. If I want to move villages, I have to pay for that scamming expensive carriage again? Do I really have to move villages once more? No, there is no need to. I will just hunt and raise my level until the new owner of this smithy starts work.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Wait?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Don’t I need equipment to hunt? This damn thing! I stored my sword and armor in the warehouse. My 50 silver!’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My stress levels weren’t a joke. My stomach hurt when I thought about all the money that was flying away.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why was my life so twisted? Uhh... I’m getting a stomach ache. I should leave here as soon as possible.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But strangely, my feet didn’t move.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘That old man... is this okay?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ah! Really! Fuck!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Maybe it was because I witnessed the dirty work.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No matter how much I dreamed about a life that was far from good, I still had the basic fundamentals of a human. It was too much for my conscience to ignore the old man surrounded by gangsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No, why risk myself for someone else? Am I stupid?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was fully aware that I should turn a blind eye to this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">So why was I hesitating?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘When did I become nosy? This behavior isn’t like me. I’ve always closed my eyes to injustice.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment I braced myself to leave the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your anger levels are at their peak after witnessing gangsters commit wrongdoings towards a blacksmith.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The quest ‘Blacksmith’s Rage’ has been created.]</span></p>
