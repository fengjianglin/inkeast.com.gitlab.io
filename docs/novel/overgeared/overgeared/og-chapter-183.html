 <p><span style="">Chapter 183</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Dragons created creatures that vaguely resembled them for fun.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Those creatures were the drakes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Drakes had much lower intelligence and physical abilities than the dragons.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Compared to dragons that were dozens of meters long, a drake was small, and their bodies were only 3m long, excluding the tail.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But they couldn’t be ignored.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The blood of a dragon flowed through them, so drakes were the strongest monsters.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had a minimum level of 260 and were two times faster and stronger than griffons. Their maximum speed was up to 120km and they could even shoot out breaths.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Drakes were considered as the best pets.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had no faults at all, except that they were very difficult to tame.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Drakes had different personalities depending on their attributes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The hundreds of millions of viewers were looking forward to seeing how many different types of drakes they could see through this pet marathon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They paid particular attention to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid, perhaps he tamed a dark drake?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"A dark attribute drake? Was there something like that? This is the first time I’ve heard of it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m not surprised. There are less than 100 users in Satisfy who’ve tamed drakes as pets, so there are only one or two who tamed dark drakes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What is good about drakes with the dark attribute?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Like bone dragons, their body is made of bone. To be precise, they are undead. Their stamina is infinite.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow... Does that mean they don’t get tired? Isn’t it a scam? Can’t you travel anywhere on the continent with a dark drake?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That doesn’t mean there are no restrictions. The bones in the body must be replaced from time to time because their durability is worn down. And they have a chronic weakness. They are significantly less intelligent than other drakes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dark drakes were so dumb that they couldn’t carry out complex orders. So in terms of battle, they were weak.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the amazing thing was that their stamina was infinite.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This pet marathon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a simple contest about who would reach the goal first.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">No matter how stupid a dark drake was, they could participate in the simple pet marathon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...He might have a dark drake.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">People had high expectations.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The target processing and PvP.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had showed shocking appearances since he first emerged in the National Competition, so it wouldn’t be strange for him to tame a dark drake.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The creature that Grid summoned wasn’t the strongest pet, but a small cat.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“No, what...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The expressions of the spectators and viewers instantly became disappointed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But that only lasted for a short time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">People started laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Gwiyeopda.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Cute...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kawaii~”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Mignon!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Niedlich~”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Carino!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Lindo...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Bellus~”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Korean, English, Japanese, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Latin and so on.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The word for cute in different languages simultaneously emerged.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even people who weren’t usually interested in cats were excited.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, the children and girls who loved cute things started to flock.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Mother! Buy me that!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Honey~ let’s raise a cat. Yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The cat that Grid summoned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It had the typical appearance of a Persian cat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Together with the color of its fur, it was very unique and attractive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Only the paws were white, while the rest of the cat was completely black.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If they saw it in the middle of the night, it would look like four white paws floating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Furthermore, it had little devil wings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It flapped its wings and flew around Grid, looking very mysterious. It was like something from a fairy tale.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The commentators were captivated by the cute appearance for a while before asking the pet experts.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 What is that winged cat? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 ... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">None of the four famous pet experts could open their mouths.&nbsp;</span><span style="">All of them were unfamiliar with the winged cat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But they were able to be sure of one thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 That cat will become the prey of the drakes. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was something that no one could deny.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A cat couldn’t go against the strongest monster, a drake.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was a huge difference in size.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A drake was 3m long, while the cat was only 40cm.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The drakes would eat this cat! Swallow it in one gulp! It was edible enough to be swallowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That cute cat is so pitiful...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">People felt sad.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Meanwhile, the pet marathon participants were laughing at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cat? Haha! I thought a legendary class would have the best pet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pet taming isn’t an easy thing to do. He must have no talent, no talent. Kilkil.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"How good would it be if he could create an item to assist with pet taming? Right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"But it’s too much. That cat is too much. I know that South Korea is a country without any drakes, but... No matter what, he intends to enter with a cat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right. Shouldn’t it at least be a griffon? Griffons are called the prey of drakes. But at least a griffon would be better against the drakes than a cat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Originally, South Korea was a country that should’ve come last in the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But thanks to Grid, they became ranked third.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The foreign players wanted to relieve their grudge, so they sneered at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid snorted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Enjoy your babbling while you can.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A memphis wasn’t a cat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His appearance was incredibly cute, but in fact, he was fearsome.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He even had the ‘strongest in hell’ attached to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“These ridiculous things.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid laughed at the participants before glancing at Noe.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Noe was a little strange.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The brave cat he saw the other day was currently shaking for some reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid detected Noe’s anxiety and checked the status window.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Name: Noe</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Species: Memphis</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level: 1 (0/200)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Affinity: 5/100</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Health: 5,000/5,000</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Physical Attack Power: 60 &nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Attack Power: 30</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Defense: 50 &nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Resistance: 80</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Attribute: Dark</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Status: Fearful</span></p>
 <p><span style="">(What is this, nyang? Why are there so many dragons, nyang? Kyak! Crazy Master is trying to feed me to dragons! Nyang! Save me, nyang!)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A memphis was cleverer and stronger than many demonkin, making it beloved by the great demons.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Indeed, there were no shortage of demonic beasts in hell.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had high pride and it was rare for them to be intimidated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But the story was different when it came to dragons.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dragons were the strongest creature in all of hell and on the earth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were the only things a memphis was afraid of.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"D-Dragons are scary! Nyang!”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Noe mistook the smell of the drakes for the dragons, so he jumped into Grid’s arms. Then Noe shook his head with closed eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“This evil master! Are you going to throw me towards dragon as food? Nyang! You will go to hell when you die! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe grumbled with resentment.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was baffled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is hell’s strongest demonic beast. Yet he’s afraid of drakes?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was completely disappointing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid clicked his tongue and grabbed Noe. However, Noe immediately struggled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Save Noe! Save me! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe cried out loudly with a protruding stomach!&nbsp;</span><span style="">His short legs were moving and it was tearful at the frightening thought that Grid would thrown him to the dragons.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a pathetic appearance, but Grid was indifferent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If you want to live, fly hard and avoid the drakes. You will be safe once you arrive at your destination.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the strongest demonic beast in hell.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid trusted Noe. This guy was still a baby, but Grid was sure that he was better than the drakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Go!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid forcefully pushed Noe at the enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This evil bastard! Remove your hand! Nyang! Save Noe! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">People were indignant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because the appearance of Grid and Noe was caught on screen for all to see.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Oh my... That cat is really terrified. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 It is amazing that a cat has wings. Then calling it Slave... Is Slave the name of the cat? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 This is a truly sad sight! It isn’t enough that Grid treats his pet as a slave, but now he is abusing it when the whole world is watching? This is too much! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">『 Even if this is virtual reality, it is too much to abuse an animal. It’s clear that the animal protection groups will be in an uproar. In particular, this is a scene that will adversely affect young children’s emotional development. Any parents should cover their children’s eyes at this moment. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The crowd was booing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid, you bastard! Don’t bother the cat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Making such a cute cat participate in the pet marathon, he’s a sick man!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“We can’t show our daughter the sight of a cat being eaten by the drakes! The competition’s committee members should have Grid leave immediately!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Treating a small animal as a slave! What a demon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The frightened cat is so pitiful... Sob sob...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Mother, that cat, is it going to be eaten by the drakes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ahhh! Scary!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The young children even started to cry. In their eyes, Grid looked like a demon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was great confusion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The committee members were worried about whether they should really leave Grid alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the players logged into Satisfy had no idea of the circumstances.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Tatang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The commentator confirmed the time and fired a magic bullet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Regardless of the outside situation, the pet marathon started.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Nyang?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe had mistaken the smell of a drake for a dragon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As he was being troubled by Grid, he heard the sound of the magic bullet and his spirit cleared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then his emerald eyes looked at the drakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...You aren’t a dragon, nyang?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Noe regained his mind.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“These lizard bastards tricked me! Kyaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Noe wasn’t nervous anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His status changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Status: Angry</span></p>
 <p><span style="">(What are these lizards? Nyang! I thought they were dragons, but they are actually food! Nyang! Daring to deceive a great demonic beast of hell! Nyang! I won’t forgive them! Nyang nyang!)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The great demon Hell Gao compared the speed of the pavranium to a memphis.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But to be precise, a memphis was much faster than the pavranium.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the fastest creature in hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kyaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The moment the pet marathon started, an amazing sight unfolded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Noe’s small mouth opened to a gigantic size and swallowed the body of a drake.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“U-Uhh...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The master of the swallowed drake was frightened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then an absurd notification window appeared in his vision.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your drake Johnson’s movement speed has dropped by 50%.] &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Numerous notification windows popped up in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your memphis Noe’s movement speed has increased by 50%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Soul Ingestion Lv. 1]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Has the ability to take away half of the target’s highest stats and transfer it to your master.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: Your own decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the moment when the effect of ‘transferring to your master’ from Soul Ingestion was activated.</span></p>
