 <p><i><span style="">Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[A fire stone has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">While Grid was struggling with Hao Gao, Peak Sword successfully managed to mine the fire stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I did it!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The red stone that clung deeply to the ground emerged, causing Peak Sword to feel a tremendous joy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was like managing to pull out a fat lump accumulated in his nose for many years! Was it like pulling out the roots? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes! Success! I gathered a fire stone!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He played Satisfy for a year and a half, endured all types of trials, gained experience and earned the 16th rank on the unified rankings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was able to raise his level through hunting, raiding a powerful boss or fighting against hostile forces. Now his eyes were opened to a new way of enjoying the game.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I felt so much pleasure the moment I extracted a mineral. Should I learn the mining skill?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword felt a serious sense of accomplishment and waved the fire stone at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“How about it? Didn’t I do well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid raised his thumb from where he was confronting Hell Gao.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Well done.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was amazing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He felt good about receiving praise from that guy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword was laughing when he suddenly frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No? What am I doing right now?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was 16th in the unified rankings and the master of the Silver Knights Guild, yet he was wagging his tail like a dog for someone at least 10 years younger than him?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Wake up.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He became more excited than necessary after realizing that the first legendary class, Pagma’s Descendant, was a Korean.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword calmed his heart and watched Grid and Hell Gao.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid looked relatively fine, while Hell Gao was wounded. He even had both hands cut off.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Amazing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The monster who slaughtered 200 Silver Knights members with an average level of 140 was being pushed back?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The dignity of a legendary class...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He recalled the battle of Bairan, which caused an uproar in the world four months ago.&nbsp;</span><span style="">One of the most powerful groups in Satisfy, the Tzedakah Guild, had been pushed on the defensive by the Yatan Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the time, Peak Sword and his guild members gathered in a pub and predicted that the Tzedakah Guild would be wiped out.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Yatan servants Neberius and Balak were overwhelmingly strong, and were also superior in numbers, so the Tzedakah Guild seemed to have no hope.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then a man suddenly appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He overturned the balance by throwing armor to Vantner, a weapon to Toon, and using the skill ‘ Pagma’s Swordsmanship’ against Neberius.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword felt his blood boil and the people filling the pub cheered in unison.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that the whole world was buzzing at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After the battle was over.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pagma’s Descendant might be armed with powerful items, but the public mocked him for having weak control. However, Peak Sword through differently.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pagma might be an excellent swordsman, but he was fundamentally a blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was right that Pagma’s Descendant took advantage of his class traits to arm himself with excellent items. He expressed his strength in a manner appropriate for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">And now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Pagma’s Descendant that he met was making good use of his class characteristics.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His armor and weapon were estimated to have a legendary rating, there were the fraudulent seven blades that moved on their own, and the ring that seemed to have a recovery skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His control skills were still bad, but thanks to the power of his items, he was strong enough to be compared to a ranker.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Hell Gao’s strength was endless.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He lost both hands, but he continued his onslaught against Grid. Peak Sword hurriedly swung his pickaxe again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Hurry. I still need to collect two fire stones.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was the new hope for South Korea, a country weak in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword wanted to help Grid in this raid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid grew so fast, that one day he would enthrall the Korean people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he still a lot of mountains to cross to reach that point.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Begin the mining!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kaaang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword found a new fire stone and swung his pickaxe.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that moment, he was Peak Pickaxe, not Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m worried... Worried.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Bairan Village Castle’s resting room.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Tzedakah Guild’s chief of staff, Toban, was anxious.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The guild members who returned after hunting or work frowned at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What happened? You have no spirit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban, who was grabbing his head, carefully opened his mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Grid went to mine fire stones...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What about Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...He told me to believe him twice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The first time was before leaving for Cork Island. Then there was one time after arriving at Cork Island.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He clearly said it two times.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaduduk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban broke his nail from worry.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And the guild members were in great shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“He said to believe in him, twice?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Huh, that’s the worst.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was after the Yatan’s massive raid was prevented.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid spend most of the four months afterwards making items, and produced a total of 142 items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Out of those 142 items, 25 were normal rated, 84 were rare, 30 were epic and 3 were unique.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was it simply bad luck, or the operator’s agenda as Grid claimed?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the early days of joining the guild, Grid had a relatively high probability of making high rated items and even produced two legendary items. However, he had been in a slump for the last four months.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The items he produced had a 20% higher performance than normal items, so even the rare rated items were good, but the guild members couldn’t help feeling disappointed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, the guild members who received normal items shed tears of blood.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A legendary blacksmith ended up creating normal rated items? Their disappointment couldn’t be expressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then they noticed something that Grid said every time he produced a normal rated item.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was ‘Believe in me.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid said it every time he believed he would produce a legendary item.&nbsp;</span><span style="">So when the guild members heard the words ‘Believe in me,’ they assumed the worst. In fact, it always produced the worst result whenever he said it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But he said it again this time...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Believe in me...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Three fire stones were needed to produce the Fire Shield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Could Grid really collect three fire stones?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It seemed like it might not happen.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Toban was sad. His ominous feelings almost always came true.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The other guild members also expressed disappointment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“If he fails to make the Fire Shield... Should the Phoenix Raid be delayed for the next time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That’s probably the case. It is unlikely for the raid to succeed if the main tanker can’t hold on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a solemn atmosphere.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After being armed with Grid’s equipment, they were strong enough to easily raid the Awakened Guardian of the Forest. Now it was possible to raid higher level boss monsters.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The 4th floor of Cork Island’s dungeon.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jeurereuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a steady stream of blood from Hell Gao’s severed wrists.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chiik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">There was smoke and an unpleasant smell as the blood touched the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid blocked his nose and suggested,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Why is a bad smell coming from your blood?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Shut up!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hell Gao’s body was suddenly full of wounds. The body of an advanced demonkin was weaker than Hell Gao thought.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In addition, the second fire stone was taken, so Hell Gao’s magic power was weakening. More than half of the black flames that symbolized his power had turned to jade.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was bad.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I am going to suffer a disgraceful loss to a human again...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He thought that only Sword Saint Muller was special.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Muller had died over 100 years ago, and now a special human had appeared again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As other demons said, the potential of the human species couldn’t be ignored.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will be ridiculed in hell if I lose to humans again.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He couldn’t give up yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will surely kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hell Gao shouted and wielded his arms.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then he covered Grid with the blood pouring from his severed wrists.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 1,850 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 1,790 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Damage is inflicted just from a drop of blood? This damn monster!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The confused Grid flinched while Hell Gao burned his wounds with his blood. Then he made an expression of enormous hatred.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will take your soul to hell and make you my slave forever!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Hell Gao changed the way he fought.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He used his staff as his primary weapon when he had both hands, and hellfire as a secondary attack. Now that he lost both hands, he could only fight as a magician, launching hot winds and hellfire.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid tried to avoid the flames.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wasn’t able to easily approach Hell Gao. Hell Gao thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Yes, he’s a swordsman, so I have the advantage when fighting at a distance.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hell Gao was two times weaker than when he first appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But by human standards, his magic power was still infinite.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He kept generating hellfire at 0.3 second intervals and fired continuously, looking like a laser gun that ran on solar energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Come and burn to ashes!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Three rays of fire that flew in a straight line!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was constrained by his air being obstructed and hurriedly tried to avoid it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the pavranium moved.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chwachwachwachwachwachwa!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The seven blades gathered in front of Grid and took the shape of a triangular shield.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The golden shield collided with the flames.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The shield stiffened and fell to the ground, while the hot winds hit the body behind it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hell Gao aimed at the heart of the floundering Grid and declared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You shall soon die.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 3,900 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 4,150 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have been hit by a lethal blow!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered 8,870 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ohh!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Flop!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid lying on the ground was hit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was very confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I was sure the 2nd round would be a KO win after I cut off his hands. Rather, he was more comfortable to deal with when swinging his staff.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hell Gao had certainly weakened since Peak Sword took the fire stone. The damage from hellfire had noticeably fallen.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he was still strong.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His strength couldn’t be measured.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have to narrow the distance...’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He could use Transcend to attack from a distance. But unfortunately, Transcend only lasted for 30 seconds. He had to save this means of attack as a trump card, so it was better to approach and attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, Hell Gao controlled the hot wind while simultaneously launching the hellfire, so a method to narrow the distance didn’t easily appear.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Hwaruruk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The wounded Grid was unable to properly control his body and fire spheres appeared around Hell Gao.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hell Gao completed 30 spheres in &nbsp;flash and burst out laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kuahahaha! This is the end!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The 30 spheres simultaneously attacked from different orbits.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was practically impossible to defend against all the fire spheres with only seven blades.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I have to take some damage.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid judged and threw three darts from his belt.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A fog spread out in the spot where Grid was standing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the 30 spheres hit the fog and exploded in unison.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Pickaxe who was swinging his pickaxe in the corner... No, Peak Sword, fell down.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because a huge explosion shook the dungeon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Peak Sword turned in the direction of Grid and his expression hardened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The fog cleared and revealed the point of explosion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid couldn’t be seen at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It can’t be...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Had he turned into a grey light after suffering from that attack?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This can’t be...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Peak Sword was frustrated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hell Gao was delighted and laughed like crazy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuahahaha! That cockroach like man has finally been turned into ashes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Human flesh was weak, and couldn’t be unharmed after being bombarded with 30 hellfire spheres.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was armed with excellent armor and received the protection of the golden blades, but there was a limit.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hell Gao was convinced that Grid had died.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...What!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The laughing Hell Gao suddenly looked back.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The center of the dungeon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hell Gao was the only one standing there after Grid became ashes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid pulled down the zip of his Hooded Zip Up and slowly appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hatred and killing intent towards Hell Gao, one of the 33 great demons of hell, circled around the blue greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puoook!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A large wound was carved on Hell Gao’s false body.</span></p>
