 <p><span>Chapter 402</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <hr>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>Two months ago, the Overgeared members had difficulty hunting in the vampire cities.&nbsp;</span><span>But this was old news.&nbsp;</span><span>The Overgeared members had overcome various trials in the Behen Archipelago and made remarkable progress. &nbsp;</span><span>No vampire except for Beriache’s direct descendants could threaten them.</span></p>
 <p><span>A vampire city.</span></p>
 <p><span>The members of Overgeared, who became stronger in the Behen Archipelago, were massacring the vampires.</span></p>
 <p><span>-</span><em><span>Kyaack!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>-</span><em><span>H-Hiik!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span>The expression ‘the monsters have dried up’ seemed to be used in this case.&nbsp;</span><span>Lauel frowned after seeing the disappearing vampires and expressed his doubts.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Everybody, didn’t you buy a East Continent Portal Scroll?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Huh? Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“After the elixirs and skill books, I used the remaining points to buy a portal scroll.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Then why are you here? Why aren’t you going to the East Continent?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Lauel was once known as the hero of the Ten Rookies.&nbsp;</span><span>If he had chosen a combat specialist class as his third advancement class, he would’ve become much stronger.&nbsp;</span><span>But Lauel sacrificed himself.</span></p>
 <p><span>Rather than enhancing his individual strength, he chose the ‘Flow Master’ class.&nbsp;</span><span>He could temporarily change the weather and terrain, but his combat power was the lowest.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I have been lagging behind for a while and can only hunt vampires, but... why are you raising your level here? I will pass this area by releasing my sealed self and causing bloodshed. You should go on a new adventure.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span>Anyway, Lauel’s tone was really annoying.&nbsp;</span><span>The Overgeared members scratched their heads like they were embarrassed by him and explained.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Didn’t we discover the presence of the Behen Archipelago because of Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span>"If it wasn’t for Grid, it would be hard to figure out how to move the East Continent.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Won’t it feel like a mutiny if we go to the East Continent before Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“It’s like pouring cold water on him.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span>Lauel’s blue eyes shook as he heard the Overgeared members’ explanation.&nbsp;</span><span>He was thrilled.</span></p>
 <p><span>“You were trying to maintain your loyalty to My Lord. Isn’t this good?”</span></p>
 <p><span>One of the basic conditions for establishing a strong force was camaraderie.&nbsp;</span><span>And the Overgeared members already had it.&nbsp;</span><span>Lauel smiled and proudly said,&nbsp;</span><span>“How wonderful. Then stop your solo play and join a party with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Eh...?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Shouldn’t you be loyal to me as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span>Party play had the advantage of hunting much faster than solo play, but it also had the disadvantage of sharing experience and items.&nbsp;</span><span>It was a loss to do party play in an area where the number of monsters was limited.</span></p>
 <p><span>But the Overgeared members couldn’t refuse Lauel’s request.&nbsp;</span><span>They knew better than anyone, even Grid, how hard he worked for the guild.</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p>[12&nbsp;<span id="footnote-12">stat points have been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Six points have been forcibly invested into intelligence due to the influence of the second class, Legendary Great Magician.]</span></p>
 <p><span>The 59th island.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was a hell-like space where monsters level 420 or higher popped up on a large scale.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid had to deal with at least three or four monsters that were 114 levels higher than him.&nbsp;</span><span>It was a desperate situation for anyone, but Grid could earn a lot.</span></p>
 <p><span>The 400 extra points in agility and intelligence, as well as Weapons Mastery and Magic Mastery helped a lot.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Weapons Mastery level is beginner level 6.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Magic Mastery level is beginner level 4.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[The Sword Mastery of ‘God Hand’ has increased to intermediate level 7.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Your memphis Noe has risen to level 202.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Doppelganger Randy has risen to level 161.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>‘It’s hard.’</span></p>
 <p><span>It was big.&nbsp;</span><span>The difficulty meant that Grid achieved a fast and steady growth.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘It would be nice if I had more potions.</span></p>
 <p><span>In fact, Grid couldn’t predict that the difficulty of the Behen Archipelago so much.&nbsp;</span><span>He didn’t have enough potions in the middle of his raid.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Chaeng!</span></em> <em><span>Chaaeng!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Grid felt regret as he was immersed in battle.&nbsp;</span><span>Noe and Randy kept one monster tied up, while Grid faced two monsters at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span>He faced each remaining monster one by one, as blue flames rose around it.&nbsp;</span><span>He activated Blacksmith’s Eyes, a skill that he acquired through a hidden piece like Item Combination.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Blacksmith’s Eyes (Lv. 1) has seen through the target’s item.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[You have explored the function of the armour that the Troll Lord is wearing!]</span></p>
 <p><span>[Time Worn Leather Vest]</span></p>
 <p><span>Defense: ???</span></p>
 <p><span>Option 1: ???</span></p>
 <p><span>Option 2: ???</span></p>
 <p><span>Option 3: Reduce damage of stabbing attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Ah, I got it.’</span></p>
 <p><span>He felt something was unusual when using Kill and Link.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Chaaeng!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Due to his rise in agility, he could swing Grid’s Greatsword faster than before.&nbsp;</span><span>The moment he defended against the troll lord’s axe, he used Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Pinnacle Kill.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Seokeok!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>[You have dealt 90,300 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[You have lost 4,500 health due to the influence of Pinnacle Kill.]</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kiyaaaaaah!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Trolls were monsters with high health and regenerative ability. Among them, the troll lord was at the peak.&nbsp;</span><span>But the boss was shaky in front of the destructive power of Pinnacle Kill, which completely ignored defense.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid hurriedly withdrew from the monster that lost 90,000 health at once and scattered yellow blood.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Ah, really.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid knew that he shouldn’t give a troll a chance to act.&nbsp;</span><span>However, the troll lord’s blood was highly acidic. Blood sprayed every time there was an injury, so Grid couldn’t easily link combos. He had to widen the distance.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kudu!</span></em> <em><span>Kududuk!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The troll lord quickly recovered from Grid’s wounds.&nbsp;</span><span>It sent Grid a provocative smile.&nbsp;</span><span>It was like saying ‘you can never hurt me.’&nbsp;</span><span>Grid thought it was ridiculous.</span></p>
 <p><span>"You aren’t a named boss.”</span></p>
 <p><span>What were the four God Hands doing while Grid was fighting?</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Shuuuuong!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The troll lord’s eyes widened.</span></p>
 <p><span>Flashing golden hands came out from a cave and gave a new weapon to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This is called Item Combination.”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kuoooooh-!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>It was a blue shark-shaped greatsword with red lights scattered around it like cherry blossoms.&nbsp;</span><span>It was the beautiful harmony of Iyarugt and Failure.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Linked Kill Wave.”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>“Ki...! Kieeeeeek!”</span></p>
 <p><span>So what if it was difficult to get close due to the acidic blood?&nbsp;</span><span>He would attack from a distance.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid laughed as the troll lord turned to grey ash.&nbsp;</span><span>However, he couldn’t laugh for long.&nbsp;</span><span>His skills were on cooldown and new monsters were gathering.</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>[You have entered the 60th island.]</span></p>
 <p><span>[This is a save point. Would you like to register?]</span></p>
 <p><span>[You have been registered. When you enter the Behen Archipelago later on, you will start from the 60th island.]</span></p>
 <p><span>“Heok... Heok... Wow, I thought I was going to fall behind.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid broke through the 59th island and sat on the ground.&nbsp;</span><span>He wanted to Meditate to restore health and stamina, but it wasn’t easy to enter the state.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I can’t adapt to the new skills.’</span></p>
 <p><span>The condition to activate Blacksmith’s Eyes was to watch the equipment for at least 3 seconds.&nbsp;</span><span>Was this hard?&nbsp;</span><span>Of course it was difficult during a battle.&nbsp;</span><span>His field of view narrowed and he often missed the target’s movements, exposing a gap.</span></p>
 <p><span>The problems didn’t end there.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘The information of the items covers my vision.’</span></p>
 <p><span>During a battle, the item information window seriously disturbed his view.&nbsp;</span><span>It felt like the navigation screen was hidden while he was driving.&nbsp;</span><span>Anyway, it seemed like he would take a long time to adapt.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I can gradually adapt.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid looked at his immediate problem.&nbsp;</span><span>The islands in the 60s. &nbsp;</span><span>Would he be able to progress through here?&nbsp;</span><span>The difficulty of the Behen Archipelago was amplified every 10 islands.&nbsp;</span><span>The last island in the Behen Archipelago was the 66th island.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was possible to infer that the difficulty of the islands from 60 onwards would be incomparably higher than before.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Originally, I wanted to clear this place before the National Competition.’</span></p>
 <p><span>It seemed to be an impossible task.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid sighed as he thought about it.&nbsp;</span><span>Did it read his anxiety?&nbsp;</span><span>The cooldown time of Assimilation ended and Braham’s soul woke up.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Challenge it first.]</span></p>
 <p><span>“Braham!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid had increasingly started to rely on Braham.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid welcomed Braham’s voice and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Do you mean I can win if I challenge the Behen Archipelago?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Braham scoffed.</span></p>
 <p><span>[You are too arrogant. I said that this is a playground made by Pagma. You haven’t reached Pagma’s full capacity yet and don’t have the ability to clear this place. I want you to challenge it to realize that you are still weak.]</span></p>
 <p><span>"...I wondered about this before, but what do you mean by a playground that Pagma created?”</span></p>
 <p><span>[Do you know about the original Behen Archipelago?]</span></p>
 <p><span>“I heard from Sticks. It was a Hall of Fame that celebrated the achievements of legends and a training ground for current legends.”</span></p>
 <p><span>[That’s right. It’s a shameful place for those who are hostile to legends.]</span></p>
 <p><span>"Those who are hostile to legends?”</span></p>
 <p><span>[Great demons. They saw an opportunity to destroy the Behen Archipelago, which connects legends. In order to prevent this, Pagma installed various gateways.]</span></p>
 <p><span>“A space created to prevent the great demons...”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid suddenly felt some doubts.</span></p>
 <p><span>“How did Pagma make this space?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Pagma was a legendary blacksmith, not a god.&nbsp;</span><span>He could install various devices, but it wasn’t possible to summon the monsters, reproduce past trials, or clone the contestants.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘It might be different if he was a magician.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Then Braham spoke meaningful words to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span>[It’s possible for a great demon.]</span></p>
 <p><span>“What?”</span></p>
