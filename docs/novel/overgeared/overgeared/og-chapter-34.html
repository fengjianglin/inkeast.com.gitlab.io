 <p><span style="">Chapter 34</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">11:33 p.m.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lim Cheolho, the head of Satisfy’s development team and of the S.A. Group, was working all night.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Satisfy was a game with over two billion users, so there were always countless variables.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Satisfy’s overall flow, whether small or large, depended on what each of the two billion users were doing. The system was impossible to maintain if errors kept occurring.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lim Cheolho was always enthusiastic about building a complete system.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can’t allow even a single error.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had unmatched concentration whenever he focused on his work and only heard his ringtone after 40 seconds or more.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a call from the operations team.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What’s going on?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">(Quest B408 has been triggered. Please authorize the convening of an emergency meeting).</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lim Cheolho’s mind revolved and then recalled the information about B408.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">B408.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a codename for S-grade hidden quests that needed special conditions to be fulfilled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The compensation for Quest B408 is a second class?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The user who cleared B408 would be able to obtain another class. In Satisfy, they might be the first user to have two classes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the more rewarding the quest was, the more difficult it would be.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In particular, the content of Quest B408 was very unique, as the user had to be trapped in an enclosed space for 200 hours of Satisfy time. It had a direct impact on the real world, since the user who performed the quest was at a great risk of suffering serious psychological damage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">One of the reasons why the clause ‘the S.A Group has permission to view user’s personal information’ was created was due to quests like B408.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I give permission. I will go as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lim Cheolho immediately stopped working and headed towards the conference room. He arrived in the meeting room and looked at the documents.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It contained information about the user who triggered the quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Amazing. A Mongolian person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Originally, Mongolia was the world’s 10th richest country when it came to resources but lacked the technology to find and use those resources.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But after breaking away from communism, the Mongolian government established diplomatic ties with many countries and actively attracted foreign direct investment (FDI).</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Since then, numerous governments and companies advanced into Mongolia, including both the Korean government and Korean companies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They called Mongolia the ‘land of opportunity’ and made investments. There was a huge inflow of foreign capital into Mongolia.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, once Mongolia’s regime changed in the 2010s, the FDIs started to slow down due to the rapid change in policy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After many years, the regime changed once again and the Mongolian officials tried to induce the FDIs again, but many had already lost confidence in Mongolia.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, the Mongolian government’s plans didn’t proceed as planned and Mongolia remained a developing country until the 2030s.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But now it was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Mongolia’s FDIs were revitalized as the world’s economy boomed, thanks to rapid technological development in the 2040s. The Mongolian government cooperated, and through some successful processes, the nation stepped into the ranks of the developed countries.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But despite this, the nomadic temperament of Mongolia didn’t change. The vast majority of the Mongol people couldn’t adapt to the new benefits and still wanted to wander the grasslands.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As a result, Mongolia became one of the countries with the smallest number of Satisfy members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">According to statistics, more than 60% of the total population of developed countries were Satisfy players. In addition, Satisfy-related businesses created a lot of jobs.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But in Mongolia, only 3% of the population played Satisfy. For the Mongols who loved wandering the grasslands, the act of being trapped in a small capsule was unacceptable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘3% of the population is a miracle.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 25-year-old with the name of Allunbatar, which was hard to pronounce, was a level 127 orator.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lim Cheolho was already surprised to see a level 127 orator, a class that was weak in combat, but he couldn’t believe that the user was a Mongolian.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Quest-based leveling: by utilizing the characteristics of an orator, he could obtain relatively difficult quests, an effective way to play.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As Lim Cheolho read the documents, the executives who had been sleeping at home rushed in for the emergency meeting. Some of them gave off the scent of alcohol.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lim Cheolho paid attention to Yoon Sangmin. Director Yoon Sangmin was obsessive about cleanliness, so this was the first time Lim Cheolho saw him with scruffy hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I thought you of all people would comb your hair, even in the midst of a war. Is Director Yoon’s weakness sleeping?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The other board members had the same thought and laughed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We finally found Director Yoon’s weakness!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Haha, that’s right. I was suspicious that you might’ve been a robot that wouldn’t bleed from its wounds. Fortunately, you are human.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The atmosphere lightened those few words from Lim Cheolho. The laughing executives completely woke up from their sleepy or tipsy state.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'You made me a scapegoat.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yoon Sangmin’s face reddened as he beckoned to Yoon Nahee.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It seems like all the executives are gathered. Have the Mongol branch president and officers come together?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes. I will connect to them immediately.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A 3D image appeared in the center of the huge roundtable. It was the appearance of the branch managers and executives of the S.A. Group’s Mongolian branch.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They greeted Lim Cheolho.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lim Cheolho proceeded with the meeting.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The agenda of this meeting is to secure the safety of the Mongolian user who triggered Quest B408, called Allunbatar. I will entrust this to Branch Manager Park.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">S.A Group’s Mongolian branch manager, Park Eunhyuk, had already completed the preparations as soon as he heard that the Quest B408 was triggered by a Mongolian user.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I’ve tracked the IP address of Allunbatar, who is connected to Satisfy, and have confirmed that the address in the member information matches his current residence. If a situation occurs, the Mongolian government will cooperate by dispatching medical personnel and police officers. Finally, during the quest, the security team members will observe Allunbatar in real time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quick and efficient actions. Lim Cheolho nodded with satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The branch manager, Park Eunhyuk, gave his opinion,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The Mongolian branch sees this quest as an opportunity and aims to use it as a foothold into the market here. I will leak some of the quest information to the media. This will be the first user who might have two classes in Satisfy, and the fact that it is a Mongolian user will be widely reported throughout the media around the world. This is natural PR, and the Mongolians will see one of their own becoming a global star through Satisfy, increasing their interest in the game.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Oh, that is a good idea. Once they have interest, the number of people who want to experience Satisfy will increase.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The major media companies in each country, especially the Mongolian media companies, will definitely jump on the news. If the press builds Allunbatar into a huge person, the Mongolian pride will be triggered and the PR effect will be maximized."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Most of the executives were favorable towards this idea.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, a small number of them didn’t like it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is there any guarantee that Allunbatar will succeed in the quest? What will happen if we make the whole world pay attention to this quest, only for it to fail?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yoon Sangmin, who just finished brushing his hair, shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It doesn’t matter if the quest is successful or not. Even if it fails, the fact that he is the first user to acquire an S-grade hidden quest will make Allunbatar stand out. Still, it would be preferred if the quest were successful. Unless there is a problem with Allunbatar’s personality and he logs out, it should be a success. Team Leader Yoon Nahee, have you analyzed the chances of Allunbatar’s quest succeeding?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Once Yoon Nahee replied, her team members handed the executives a new piece of paper.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Mongolian branch executives also received the document through email.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">After a while, the executives read the contents of the paper and frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this? The probability of success is only 9%?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Director Yoon Sangmin was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"W-What is this?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yoon Sangmin couldn’t accept this response.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Doesn’t Quest B408 involve being rescued by a hidden NPC? Allunbatar’s health condition is also very good. If we protect Allunbatar on the outside, it is unlikely for him to log out. If Allunbatar doesn’t log out, he will be rescued by the hidden NPC and will clear the quest. So why is the success rate so low? I’ve predicted at least an 80% success rate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Well...”&nbsp;</span><span style="">The moment that Yoon Nahee tried to explain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuhahahahaha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The silent Lim Cheolho suddenly burst out laughing?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Everyone looked at Lim Cheolho in shock.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Tsk tsk tsk. </span></i><span style="">Lim Cheolho clicked his tongue and stated,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Your nature is too frantic. Shouldn’t you read the document first before asking the question?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The executives read the document carefully at Lim Cheolho’s words and were shocked at its contents.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yoon Sangmin nervously crumbled up the piece of paper and muttered,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Again... this person...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The normal scenario for Quest B408 was like this:&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A user with high reputation would build up affinity to the maximum with the Winston residents. In the process of building affinity, the user would learn about the wickedness of Winston’s lord and the Mero Company. At this time, the user would be assimilated with the Winston residents and sincerely resent the Mero Company and the lord. The residents of Winston would detect this and give the user a quest called ‘For the Residents of Winston’.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Once the user accepted the quest, the story would begin in earnest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The user would try to meet Earl Steim, but they couldn’t go against the powers of Winston’s lord and the Mero Company. The user would be caught and eventually imprisoned in the dungeon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At this point, the quest would change from ‘For the Residents of Winston’ to ‘Wait’. If the user were to accept this quest, the ‘Mysterious Apostle of Justice’ NPC, who would be hiding in Winston due to special circumstances, would rescue the user after 200 hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In this case, the user would establish a relationship with the ‘Mysterious Apostle of Justice’ and find out their identity.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then the user would go on a journey to help the mysterious NPC. Once the user performed all the linked quests, they would receive rewards beyond imagination.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, a variable meant that the quest didn’t flow along the scheduled scenario.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The variable was that Allunbatar shared the quest information with another user.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The planned ‘Mysterious Apostle of Justice’ NPC became obsolete, and the related quests to the NPC also disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The news that Allunbatar was confined in the dungeon after failing the quest would be passed onto the user whom he shared the quest information with, not the ‘Mysterious Apostle of Justice’.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But that user turned out to be...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Exactly 12 days ago, the Korean user who obtained a legendary class by chance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Right, it was Shin Youngwoo.</span></p>
