 <p><span style="">Chapter 306</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham Eshwald.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">One of the nine direct descendants of Shizo Beriache.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was one of the cleverest in the clan, and one day he had a deep question.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘God Yatan gave us the Curse of Idleness because of our strength and ambition, but why?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">God Yatan had a destructive desire.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wished to bring destruction to all the beings blessed by the goddess of light, Rebecca.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Absolute strength and cruelty was necessary to accomplish this desire, and the right species was the vampires.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vampires were powerful and could achieve God Yatan’s wish.&nbsp;</span><span style="">So why seal their power with the Curse of Idleness?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t understand it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Furthermore.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Why wasn’t any prohibition placed on the great demons?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It stunk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Braham smelled something nasty and started to explore deeper into the gods.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then after 483 years, he discovered a fact.&nbsp;</span><span style="">God Yatan’s destructive instinct only activated in a certain cycle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Once human desires reaches the peak, chaos will come to the world.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In other words, it happened when Goddess Rebecca could no longer control the world.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Only then would God Yatan’s destructive instincts be exercised.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'God Yatan will emerge to destroy the world, then Goddess Rebecca will once again create a new world.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yatan and Rebecca.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The two opposing gods on the surface were actually cooperating with each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kukuk... We’re just playthings in the hands of the gods.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Even now, the creatures of Yatan and Rebecca were hating and slaughtering each other.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was originally designed like this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yatan and Rebecca were actually in a relationship to maintain the balance of this world?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham felt a great sense of betrayal.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His infinite reverence for Yatan vanished.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He suddenly realized the reason why Shizo Beriache, originally one of the great demons, was expelled from hell into the human world.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Mother was like me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The clever Beriache would’ve known about the reality of Yatan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She questioned him and was cursed with the Curse of Idleness, as well as being expelled from hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What about the other great demons?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Did they know the truth, or were they just obedient puppets?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No matter what.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was only one thing Braham wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will overcome the Curse of Idleness.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Shizo Beriache was a great demon of predation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The vampires who inherited her blood also had the same tendencies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Among them, Braham wanted to eat knowledge.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, due to the Curse of Idleness, he slept most of the day and it was almost impossible.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There is deep meaning in the great god’s curse.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He must’ve cursed us to restrain our appetites.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But what was the reality?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There is no god in the first place.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yatan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In other words, the omnipotent entity they thought of as a god didn’t exist.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was a passive machine that existed just for the providence of the world.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was no reason to serve it or endure the current trials.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Yatan, I will overcome the curse you laid on us and will be faithful to my instincts.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He would accumulate knowledge and become a perfect existence!&nbsp;</span><span style="">On that day, Braham pledged to explore all the disciplines and magic of the world.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Over hundreds of years, he built up his knowledge and devoted himself to magic research by using all types of species as his test subjects. Among them were his clan members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">And this was the beginning of the worst situation.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Braham! I’ll kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A vampire was crying while hugging his lover’s dead body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was Elfin Stone, the 9th child of Shizo Beriache.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Leah, you dare do to her...! Leah!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone was enraged that his lover was the victim of the research.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Braham asked him,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Brother, do you fail to understand my inquiring mind even until the end? Don’t you wonder about the source of my inquisitiveness?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I don’t understand! How can I understand your strange behavior when studying magic, to the point of even sacrificing your clan members? You’re just crazy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...You’re saying this as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He blamed the Curse of Idleness.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They didn’t question anything. They found everything annoying and only coped with the things in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“There is no value for our clan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham confirmed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Brethren, listen to me. You’re worse than the humans you treat as livestock. You have no right to grab at my ankles.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Stop talking such sophistry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Elfin Stone used Blood Field and summoned Iyarugt to attack Braham.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he wasn’t his match from the beginning.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Braham was a duke while Elfin Stone was just an earl, so the difference was clear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dammit...! Dammit! Brahammmm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Disgusting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The sight of the screaming and bleeding Elfin was sad and funny.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even as Elfin Stone was about to be killed by the enemy, he couldn’t endure the drowsiness and his eyes were closing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Braham.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A woman appeared in front of the laughing Braham.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Shizo Beriache.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Mother...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham was shaken.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Beriache had been sleeping for hundreds of years after being directly cursed by Yatan, so why was she awake at this time?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘She should’ve woken up in 50 years.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham was confused when he suddenly felt something strange from Beriache.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can’t feel her vitality.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Beriache was dying.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why? She should have eternal life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘That girl...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham belatedly noticed the girl standing next to Beriache.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a black-haired girl who looked exactly like Beriache.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is this my 10th sibling?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham’s expression distorted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The magic power coming from the girl was far beyond Beriache’s power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Mother! You gave birth to a being beyond yourself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...You broke the taboo that the clan members shouldn’t be harmed, no matter what.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Mother, that...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham tried to explain, but closed his mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He knew that his actions of sacrificing his clan members for his greed wouldn’t be forgiven.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Beriache looked at him with hatred.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I have loved you more than anyone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Tears appeared in Braham’s eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because Beriache, who should be enjoying eternal life, now had wrinkles on her neck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">All of this was due to that girl!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Braham struck at at his new sibling.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And he failed to hit the girl, Marie Rose.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Excuse me for doing this from the beginning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The power of Marie Rose was absolute.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Despite being a newborn, she defeated Braham who was the strongest of the clan.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Paduduk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ack...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham groaned angrily as he grabbed his injured wrist.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Beriache’s hate-filled gaze didn’t leave him. She was merciless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I have warned all of you that our clan has a craving for predation, so an unimaginable situation will occur if we hurt each other. You have killed many clan members while I was sleeping, and now you want to harm your sibling in front of me? I will punish you to set an example!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham’s expression twisted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Marie Rose’s little fangs bit his neck and all the blood in his system was sucked out, causing unimaginable pain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On this day, Braham lost his eternal life. He was banished from the clan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After 100 years.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham concealed himself as a human while studying magic and succeeded in overcoming the Curse of Idleness.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now he had a finite life.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He needed to regain eternal life in order to eat more knowledge.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham started to explore immortality magic, and in the process, he gained the title of great magician.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the end, he couldn’t complete the magic of eternal life.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there was no need to feel despair. It was the next best thing, but he completed the resurrection magic.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham finished recalling the past and returned to reality.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He stood in front of the human called Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[I asked you to make me the Vessel of the Soul. Then I will be resurrected. I will be able to repeat this resurrection several times in the future. But you said that you can’t create the Vessel of the Soul because you can’t receive God Yatan’s blessing?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes. It’s impossible, since I have a hostile relationship with the Yatan Church."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham begged Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[If so, please give me permission to possess your body.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Possess... What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid doubted his ears.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Possession!&nbsp;</span><span style="">It meant that a ghost would be inside his body!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wasn’t this the material of a third-rate horror movie?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What if I don’t want to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid disliked supernatural phenomena.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Braham tried to persuade him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[There is no need to worry about your body. The only thing I will do is fly to the Yatan Church to receive Yatan’s blessing.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Will it be that easy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid asked suspiciously, but Braham answered without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[I can smash the Yatan Church, even if I was occupying the body of a five year old child.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Indeed, this was the confidence of a legendary great magician who survived fighting against the dragon Trauka.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[I will give you all the pavranium I possess if you let me borrow your body for half a day. In addition, I will teach you one spell.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Why does an already dead person want to be resurrected?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham’s answer was simple and concise.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[I want to explore all the knowledge that exists in this world. I will become immortal!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then a notification window popped up in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Second Class Quest: [Great Magician’s Resurrection has been updated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Great Magician’s Resurrection]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Great Magician Braham is insatiable. He has no intention of stopping his search for knowledge.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It is part of his natural instincts, so he can’t be condemned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Conditions: Accept Braham’s soul and make a Vessel of the Soul out of the pavranium that has been blessed by God Yatan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Quest Clear Reward: Learn a magic spell. Acquire all the pavranium scattered throughout the continent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The total number of pavranium was 28.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Out of that number, Grid currently owned 11 pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I need at least 18 pieces of pavranium to perfectly reproduce Lifael’s Spear.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If he obtained all the pavranium, he would have 10 pieces remaining, even if he made Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, he didn’t need to cling to Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He should be able to create an even better item if he took advantage of all 28 pavranium.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the reward of the magic spell attracted Grid more than the pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Can I really learn magic as a blacksmith?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It might be only one spell, but it was a spell taught by a great magician.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Obviously the spell would be terrific.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The thrilled Grid accepted the changed quest without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay! I will accept your request!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[An excellent choice!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham’s soul fragment shouted and flew towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Braham is trying to enter your body. Would you like to accept?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Of course!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the same time, Grid’s body was surrounded by light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have accepted the soul of the great magician, Braham.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your class will be changed from Pagma’s Descendant to Great Magician.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[From now on, your body will move according to Braham’s will.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The party members watching the situation let out impressed sounds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because Grid’s status window was amazing after he accepted Braham’s soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid (Great Magician)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lv. 545</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Health: 858,310</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Mana: 13,965,000</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The party information window didn’t show detailed information such as attack power, magic power, defense, skills list, etc. However, they could guess it based on the level, health and mana.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The white-haired, red-eyed Grid spoke to the open mouthed party members.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I am thankful to everybody. The securing of the pavranium is now meaningless, so return to Reidan first.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s body disappeared with the light.</span></p>
