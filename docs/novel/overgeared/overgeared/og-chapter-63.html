 <p><span style="">Chapter 63</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">After finishing the deal with Grid, the administrator returned to the meeting room where Irene and the nobles were waiting to hear his report.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Nobody was shaken after hearing that the sword was purchased for 220,000 gold, as it really was worth spending that much.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Sir Phoenix, you will take this sword and punish the Yatan Church.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Everyone watched as Irene handed Phoenix the Sword of Self-transcendence.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Phoenix kneeled down and respectfully received the sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"For the glory of the north and Earl Steim, I will surely be victorious in battle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Phoenix equipped the Sword of Self-transcendence.</span></p>

 <p><span style="">Skill Mana Cost: 1,000</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 3,000 seconds&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dispatch the troops! Return with the head of one of the Seven Servants!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Upon receiving Irene’s order, Phoenix led 12 knights and 1,500 soldiers towards the Yatan Temple.&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, there were approximately 150 people at the Yatan Temple.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But no one was careless.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The minimum level of the believers was 160, while the soldiers had a minimum level of 50.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The difference in individual skill was obvious. &nbsp;And the enemy was one of the Seven Servants.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Superiority in number and strategy was essential for the win.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Phoenix confirmed the sighting of the Yatan Temple in the distance and shouted at the knights and soldiers,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t shrink back. &nbsp;I am in front of you! The north’s strongest knight, Phoenix! I will take the head of one of the Seventh Servants. &nbsp;You just have to believe and follow me! Then we will obtain victory!!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ohhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A huge shout echoed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The sound was enough to reach the Yatan Temple.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The pagans are coming! Those who don’t know how fearful God Yatan is are advancing to defile this sacred space!”&nbsp;</span><span style="">The shaken believers cried out urgently.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura stood at the edge of the temple’s roof that was on a cliff and observed the large army flying Earl Steim’s flag.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Take the high ground. &nbsp;Pour magic towards the ground, paying attention to the archers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What about Yura...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The head of the temple looked at her with worry.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura sent him a cool look and replied,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I will go down to the ground and block their advance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura was well aware that the Yatan Church was wicked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She felt skepticism while carrying out all types of malicious quests.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, the Seven Servants were evil beings that evoked hatred.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But she had already chosen. &nbsp;This was Satisfy, not reality. &nbsp;There was no going back unless she got a hidden class like Agnus or Katz did. &nbsp;She had to keep moving forward unless she wanted to give up her ranker position.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She was already accustomed to the stigma of being the Blood Witch, so she was prepared for another slaughter.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Taack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura jumped from the high cliff and landed as light as a feather in front of the enemy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Phoenix discovered Yura, stopped the army and shouted,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"A sharp energy is flowing from you! You are certainly one of the Seven Servants! Today I will end your infamous actions!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Phoenix was mistaken. &nbsp;Yura wasn’t one of the Seven Servants, but one of the candidates in line to become the Eighth Servant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">For Yura, whose power was still far below the Seven Servants, Phoenix and his great army were both frightening.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Yura had no intention of stepping back.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was a total of 143 believers isolated in this temple, and she had to save all of them to clear her quest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Only then would she be reborn as the Eighth Servant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Great god of the darkness, your humble servant calls you. Fill this place with darkness and plant fear in the enemies’ hearts, show your power to those who worship you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The whole area started to fill with darkness.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Despite the sun shining in the sky, it turned darker than night.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As the 1,500 troops fell into confusion and panic, Yura showed off her strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Dark Storm!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A huge storm of darkness descended and swallowed the army.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yura didn’t doubt that more than a quarter of them would die or be seriously injured. &nbsp;Then she stopped as she was trying to chant another attack spell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"......!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a ridiculous situation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The knight called Phoenix rushed out of the storm towards Yura, who hurriedly cast a defense spell.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Phoenix’s strike hit a diamond wall, scattering brilliant sparks every which way.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the Diamond Barrier that exerted overwhelming defense against physical attacks!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Phoenix shouted from in front of the barrier,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t even think of touching the soldiers! Your opponent is me! Perfect State of Self-transcendence!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kuwaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A purple energy rose from Phoenix’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kkikikikik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Phoenix’s sword started to cause cracks in Diamond Barrier.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was impossible. &nbsp;This was the diamond barrier that could even withstand strong physical strikes from boss monsters. &nbsp;How could a mere knight break it?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjeok.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Diamond Barrier was split in half.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Phoenix moved through Diamond Barrier and attacked with an expressionless face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hell!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura cast a spell that would cause fear in a single target.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Shaaaaaah.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A black powder covered Phoenix’ body.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He would soon be defenseless due to fear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Phoenix was fine as he attacked Yura without any hesitation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">For a limited time, his stats had doubled and the skill gave him resistance to abnormal conditions. &nbsp;This drove Yura into a crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura recalled someone else who was perfectly resistant to her magic when she looked at Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was ironic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the past, Yura had interfered with Grid’s S-grade quest and caused him to fail, and now her quest was being hampered by a sword that Grid made.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura groaned and whispered the spell that had been completed before Diamond Barrier.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Darkness."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Exactly 17 days ago, Yura achieved 100,000 faith and she heard the voice of God Yatan in her ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will give you a new power if you pray.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yura prayed to him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She asked for the strength to fight those resistant to black magic!&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a new form of power developed thanks to her experience meeting Grid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">That power was now being used.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">I disposed of all my items, including Mamon’s Greatsword and Mengel's Plate Armour that were in the warehouse. &nbsp;As a result, I had around 240,023 gold.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I registered 220,000 gold on the item trading site and sold it to users for cash.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the process, something occurred.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The item trading site took away 5% as the transaction fee.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wasn’t 5% a small amount?&nbsp;</span><span style="">How ridiculous! 5% of 264 million won was 13.2 million won!&nbsp;</span><span style="">I earned this money with my blood and sweat, only for the trading site people to sit there and snatch some away!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"There are many ways to profit off people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I honestly admired it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If I had been a little bit smarter, I would’ve been able to live like that...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Anyway, I used 10 million out of the 250,800,000 won to pay Mother's Heart is Happy Financial Services and gave my father a bankbook containing the remaining 240,800,000 won.&nbsp;</span><span style="">My parents checked the bankbook and couldn’t believe it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This... &nbsp;is it a fake account?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My mother was suspicious.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Did you do something strange?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">My father doubted me.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Oppa... &nbsp;did you sell your organs? Lift up your shirt. &nbsp;I will check if you have any surgery marks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee thought something strange!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They didn’t believe me at all. &nbsp;I inwardly boiled with anger. &nbsp;But I understood the reaction from my family.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Despite going to university, I was a 26-year-old with a debt and who was obsessed with a game.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was unrealistic that such a son would suddenly appear with a bankbook containing a lot of money.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After a while, my family acknowledge the reality and finally opened their mouths.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It is good that you can earn money doing something you like. &nbsp;Your hard work playing the game for the past year wasn’t in vain. &nbsp;Yes, a world where you can do anything you want... &nbsp;My heart is somewhat settled now that you’ve found your aptitude.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Youngwoo, I was talking to my friend and she told me about her friend’s son. &nbsp;If you earn enough money with Satisfy, you can become a huge ranker. &nbsp;Maybe you can eventually appear on TV? Yes? My son is going to appear on TV?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Oppa is actually good at something... &nbsp;Hrmm~ well, it is great. &nbsp;I know that few among the two billion users playing Satisfy earn a huge amount of money. &nbsp;Oppa proved that you are a great person among those two billion people... &nbsp;well, you are somewhat qualified to be my Oppa.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It felt like their gazes towards me had significantly changed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their previous consistently disappointed looks towards me now said ‘my son is good’ and ‘I should treat Oppa better.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I am proud... &nbsp;Huhuhut.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Sehee interrupted my excitement as she said,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Don’t laugh. &nbsp;It makes me upset.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“......”</span></p>
