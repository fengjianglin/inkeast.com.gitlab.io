 <p><span style="">Chapter 188</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">If Pagma’s Descendant was a class that relied on items, orators were a class that specialized in talking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They could get more favorable conditions for quests by talking to NPCs, or give buffs or debuffs with specific remarks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In particular, orators were absolutely necessary for nobles and lords. It was possible to boost the morale of the army through eloquence, and it was easily to appeal to the people and take control of the public opinion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But an orator wasn’t a preferred class for users.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most users were reluctant to become orators, so they were a very rare class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The problem was that it was difficult to raise their level.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The weapon they could equip was ‘books.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had only one attack skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were no defense or escape skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had lower health than a magician.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">First of all, the problem was that their weapon was a book.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A book had the option of adding to the narrative power, but it didn’t have the ability to increase magic power or store magic like orbs.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They had to charge with the weapon and swing it at the target.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But would the target be hurt if hit with a book? Not at all. The attack power was too weak.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A book exerted much less damage than a blacksmith’s hammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The only attack skill an orator possessed was Spiteful Tongue.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was also a problem.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t practical at all, because there was a 80 second cooldown and it only dealt 200% damage to a single target.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was practically impossible for an orator to hunt solo. They had to rely on hunting in parties.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, it was difficult for an orator to find a party.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was due to the lack of viability.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What did the great buffs and debuffs matter?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was obvious when an orator participated in battle. Their constants words were tiring. The party members also had to keep on eye on the orator to make sure they didn’t die.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most users didn’t like having orators in their party. Apart from the orator class, there were clerics, black magicians, dancers, linkers, etc. to give buff skills, so there was no need to add an unstable orator to the party.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As a result, it was very difficult for an orator to level up through hunting. They weren’t able to level up through production like production classes, so they had to rely on leveling up through quests.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In other words, the level of difficulty for an orator was the highest among all classes in Satisfy, and most users avoided the orator class due to this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was despite the fact that orators were a class that nobles and lords all over the continent would pay expensive money for!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was truly lucky to obtain the 1st ranked orator as his subordinate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'...Does Grid know such facts?’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel questioned as he looked at Grid, who always made Huroi run errands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">At the same time, in the outskirts of Winston.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Sword?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The ‘unique’ Huroi who obtained a second class in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Shay’s party was frowning at the horrifying debuff that was placed on them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now the orator was armed with a sword?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Moreover, the sword had a sinister appearance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Didn’t it resemble the greatsword that Grid used to smash them in the past?&nbsp;</span><span style="">They felt anxious as the bad memory popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It can’t be... No?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Shay tried to calm down as he smiled awkwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“An orator armed with a sword... Isn’t he still an easy threat? Right? Are you bluffing? You, you can’t wield that. Right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi was exactly 937th on the unified rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was a similar ranking to Shay, and was high enough to be compared to Kerb and Sniffer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Nevertheless, the reason why Shay dared face Huroi was simple.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi was an orator.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Wasn’t an orator the weakest?&nbsp;</span><span style="">His level might be high, but it was thanks to Grid’s power and repeated party hunting. Huroi himself would be extremely weak.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Why was he armed with a sword?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Shay rapidly became uneasy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It seemed that he couldn’t grasp Huroi properly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Originally, I was a helpless existence.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Huroi gazed at Shay’s party and brought up an old story.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I raised my level while doing small quests. Then one day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yes, he first met his lord in Winston.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I acquired the first S-grade quest of my life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was forced to do an outrageous quest where he was trapped in a narrow dungeon for 50 hours of real time.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was unimaginably painful. It wasn’t a level he could endure with his usual mentality.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He wanted to give up and logout many times.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he endured it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He persevered in the hopes of going beyond the limits of an orator.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he kept waiting and waiting.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I didn’t think the quest would end.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A quest where he had to wait for a savior who might not appear.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Huroi had gone half crazy by the quest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t log out for more than 150 hours in game time and was trapped in a dark place.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His sense of time blurred.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wasn’t aware of what he was doing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was just hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Just before the quest’s time limit ended.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A ray of light appeared in the darkness.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the moment when Grid appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...My Lord saved me. Thanks to him, my wait wasn’t in vain and I was able to complete the quest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He got a new strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Second class: Apostle of Justice’s Partner.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* A matchless bravery.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When you are with the Apostle of Justice, all stats will increase by 20%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* The skills Unbreakable Justice and Sacrifice for Justice can be used.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Title ‘One who Overcomes Hardships.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Holds extremely high mental strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Won’t give in to any trials.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Skill ‘Strong Will’ can be used.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Master has given me new strength.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now he was strong.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He only existed for his lord!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I won’t allow anyone to harm My Lord!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Shay’s party was thrilled by Huroi’s story.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'This is a touching story...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid, this guy...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘My heart is heavy!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was truly an orator.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Huroi’s story made people listen to him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Therefore, Shay’s party couldn’t help concentrating on Huroi’s story. It was like they were the protagonists of the story.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were thrilled when Huroi got to the part when he was saved.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They couldn’t help thinking of Grid as wonderful, despite being their enemy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That was the problem. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have become fascinated by the interesting story.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You feel like the main character of the story.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Thanks to the story, you have lost all sense of reality. You are unable to grasp the situation.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You will feel confused for 3 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Originally, an orator’s weapon was their mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Giving an orator a chance to use their mouth was no different from suicide.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What is this...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shit! What is this fraudulent skill?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Shay’s group never had experience dealing with orators, so they became easily confused.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Huroi stared at them and shouted,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“You dare try to kill me? Come!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your morale has increased.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The next attack will be a critical hit!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This was the highest buff skill of an orator, that applied a buff to all allies for two seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Huroi swung his black sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Unbreakable Justice!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Unbreakable Justice Lv.5 (88.1%)]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Deals 650% of your attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Mana Cost: 500</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Skill Cooldown Time: 100 seconds</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Unbreakable Justice was an unique skill that only the Apostle of Justice and his partner could use.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It dealt damage in a wide area and the cooldown time was very short compared to its power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Grid hardly ever used Unbreakable Justice after acquiring Pagma’s Swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Compared to the legendary rated Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Unbreakable Justice had no advantages except that it was an immediate use skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">For Grid, it was more mana efficient to use Pagma’s Swordsmanship than Unbreakable Justice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Unbreakable Justice was Huroi’s main skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He relied on the skill so much that he already built up tremendous proficiency with it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was level 5. Now it dealt 650% wide area damage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Furthermore, the black sword that Huroi was currently armed with...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Mass-produced One-handed Sword (Prototype)]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 49/51 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 423</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Attack Speed: -7% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accuracy: -2%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A trial work by the legendary blacksmith G.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A one-handed sword that can be easily used by anyone, and is designed to exert high attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It’s an aggressive design made by referencing Dainsleif (Reproduction), and has succeeded in manifesting great attack power. However, it emphasizes convenience, so the overall perfection is poor, meaning additional functions such as durability are weak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If steel was used as the main material rather than black iron, the limitations of this work would be more prominent and it would be treated as a consumable item.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 230 or higher. 300 strength. Beginner Sword Mastery.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 410</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi generated the Sword Mastery passive after acquiring his second class.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He could now use a sword as a weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he was an orator and his strength stat was very low, so it was impossible for him to use a proper sword for his level.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His troubles ended after Grid made the Mass-produced One-handed Sword (Prototype) for him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The name indicated that Grid planned to earn money through mass production of it someday, but the attack power was already beyond the limits of a one-handed sword. It was comparable to the minimum attack power of Dainsleif.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Half of Grid’s intentions when producing it was successful.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 7,910 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 9,250 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have dealt 10,180 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Assassins invested their points into agility instead of stamina. Therefore, they relied on high evasion instead of defense.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But they were in a state of confusion and couldn’t avoid the attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Shay’s party was struck by the power of Unbreakable Justice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have suffered fatal damage!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You can’t regain your mental state.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The enormous damage caused them to suffer from confusion again.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the ‘confusion linkage’ that they had only heard rumors about.&nbsp;</span><span style="">An orator managing to do something like this...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘...Does this make sense?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Ah... Really, shit...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Shay was grouchy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They dreamed of getting revenge on Grid, only to be killed by his subordinate before even meeting Grid?&nbsp;</span><span style="">And the subordinate was an orator?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Damn...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">They couldn’t help cursing.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Three assassins being beaten by an orator. If this was known, they would be ridiculed everywhere they went.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were also worried about their experience and items dropping.</span></p>
