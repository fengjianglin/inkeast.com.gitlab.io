 <p><span style="">Chapter 295</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><span style=""> "...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As soon as they ran away from the area of Blood Field, a notification window popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your party member Huroi has died.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The atmosphere was heavy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shit... There is a day when I have to sacrifice my companion to live...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is the result of our lack of power. Let’s take this opportunity to work harder.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The party members no longer blamed Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They knew Grid hadn’t chosen to abandon Huroi because he wanted to.&nbsp;</span><span style="">When they looked at it calmly, Grid’s decision was right. No, maybe it was better. Thanks to Grid’s decision, the rest of the party were able to escape the crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He took the nature of the boss into consideration and created such a situation?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the day they noticed that Grid wasn’t evolving in just personality and abilities, but in intelligence as well.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The present situation wasn’t bad when they thought about it positively.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Regas was still shivering.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It would’ve been better for all of us to die, rather than sacrificing someone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Originally, Regas was a sympathetic person who valued righteousness above all else.&nbsp;</span><span style="">When Grid was still immature.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Regas was the only one who respected and trusted Grid, who was ignored by everyone else.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Thus, Grid could understand Regas’ anger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But understanding didn’t mean he could accept it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“If you have time to grumble, kill more monsters. We now have to clear four buildings in 23 hours.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s group took an average of 10 hours to clear a building.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was a lot. The first two days, it took them at least 12 hours to finish a building.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There were many strong vampires in each building. In particular, those with more than two True Blood vampires were particularly dangerous. There were times when Vantner needed to use his invincible skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now Grid declared that the strategy was to spend six hours per building. In particular, the number of people had decreased by one.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In a way, it proved that Grid was the most enraged person about Huroi’s sacrifice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Look. We’ll be wiped out if we hurry. It will be unlucky if we encounter a party with more than three True Blood vampires, and if there is no rest...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Vantner is correct. We should maintain our previous pace. Don’t you know that we can get more hurt if we’re too hasty? Grid, I understand your feelings, but don’t be too irritated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon persuaded.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Jishuka and Peak Sword’s thoughts were different.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No, we have to do as Grid says. Elfin Stone will come to us again tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If Grid doesn’t reach level 300 by then, this situation will happen again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The goal was set.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“More haste and more speed. We have to hurry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid entered the new building and immediately aimed Transcend at the ceiling.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kurururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a loud sound as the ceiling collapsed and dust covered the place.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Bump!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kung!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">There were piles of stones.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The coffins in the part of the hall with the collapsed ceiling opened simultaneously.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Hundreds of vampires escaped and gazed around angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Who dares to awaken us from our sleep!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"These human scum want to die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"No, I want to kill you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid held Failure and the Doppelganger’s Greatsword with a cold expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I am angry.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">His party members were here to help him with his quest.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was shaken by his helplessness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid led the way.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was no stopping.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The red light of the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch shone in the darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I! I'm going to become stronger!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Yes, he would become strong enough not to experience this dirty feeling twice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The best!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid finally had a goal to play this game.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What was the one thing he needed?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Numerous combat experience, level and senses. As well as the power of items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ohhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid entered the middle of hundreds of vampires!&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the darkness, Failure and Grid’s Boots became more powerful.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Now he was able to fight better than before he arrived in the vampire city.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had struggled with a large number of enemies all day long and grew more proficient.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he should remain calm at all times.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kek! Ugh! H-Hik! Save me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid moved like a madman among the vampires and quickly became ragged.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The party members had to struggle to clean up his mess.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Reidan Castle’s resurrection point.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi appeared with a burst of light.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He looked fine considering that his body had been torn apart by Elfin Stone a while ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pant... Pant...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi’s breathing was rough. His body was trembling like crazy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had a strong mentality, but he hadn’t experienced his body being hacked apart before.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He breathed out as he shook off the shock and opened the status window.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">He checked his experience gauge.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘10%....’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The drop in experience was a huge 29.3%.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From level 200 onwards, the loss of experience after death was in proportion to the level.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Fortunately, no items dropped.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t comforting.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The durability of all of his items had dropped by at least 100 points.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If Huroi was an ordinary user without Grid, he would’ve had to spend a lot of money on repairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huroi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel ran over to Huroi.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was the busiest person in the guild. Lauel was tired.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He knew of only two ways to escape from a vampire city.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was to kill the boss or die.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was only one reason for one member of the party to return.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...You, did you die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Huroi nodded at Lauel’s question.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The boss is too strong."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Please tell me the story.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was no reason to hide it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Huroi told Lauel all the details of what happened in the vampire city.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel’s reaction to the story was surprisingly bright.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid used such a method? Haha! Incredible! Grid’s brain wasn’t just a decoration!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel was truly jubilant about Grid’s growth. But this choice of words was inappropriate, so Huroi couldn’t help glaring.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid’s expedition of the 13th expedition will end in failure. Maybe this time tomorrow, Grid’s party will appear at the resurrection point.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The meeting room in Reidan Castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel convened the former members of the Tzedakah Guild and delivered the news of Grid’s party to them.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Overgeared members murmured at the desperate story.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban gritted his teeth,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I should’ve gone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban was a paladin with divine power. He was the antithesis of vampires.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he didn’t take part in the expedition because he was in charge of the yellow mithril mine.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were few people in Overgeared who could manage the workers, so Toban was an invaluable presence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel waited until the atmosphere calmed and opened his mouth again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“As you know, pavranium is indispensable for Grid. The more pavranium that Grid obtains, the stronger he will become. So I will send an additional two people to support Grid’s party.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Reidan, Bairan, Cork Island.&nbsp;</span><span style="">These three territories must be managed so more support was impossible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Just sending two people as support was hard for Lauel. If only two people were missing, Lauel would have to reduce his sleeping time and managing the territory would become more difficult.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban declared,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“I am going to join.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Nope. Not you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ik...! Think about it! I will be the biggest help to Grid’s party right now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I’m aware of that. But now that the number of miners is over 100 people, you can’t leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Then what about me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the human beast, Toon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel shook his head again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Not you either. If you leave the guild while the main force is absent, the guild’s attack power will drop to a dangerous level.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Then who are you going to send?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hrmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel examined the Overgeared members.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Including Huroi, there were a total of three people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Who could be a big help to Grid without taking away too much from the territory management?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel struggled before pointing out one person.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ibellin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The flamberge master, Ibellin!&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was delighted at being called.&nbsp;</span><span style="">For the past few days, he had just been hunting the monsters near the mine.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The second one... Hah.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Lauel sighed at the thought.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"No matter how I look, there isn’t another useless person like Ibellin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel and Ibellin were still rivals from their days in the Ten Rookies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As the two people were fighting, somebody knocked on the door of the meeting room.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Come in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel called out and a soldier opened the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A guest has come.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Guest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What guest would come to the guild?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“T-This is ridiculous...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Overgeared members were surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was because they confirmed the identity of the guest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Nice to meet you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Even the voice was beautiful.&nbsp;</span><span style="">White skin and black hair.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A slender figure and neat impression that radiated charm.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was her, Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel smiled widely.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pant pant... Shit, I’m going to die now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The bloodstained Vantner cursed and screamed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The situation was desperate.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were over 100 vampires surrounding Grid’s current party, and there were also three True Blood vampires.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">On the other hand, the eight people of Grid’s group were now ragged.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their health and mana was at the bottom and even their stamina was low, so it was difficult to raise a finger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the aftermath of hunting without any rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It’s too much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I wanted to slam my fist into that bastard Elfin Stone’s face. It’s too bad I’ll die before that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The party assumed the worst.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even Jishuka, who always encouraged the group, was silent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid stared at her chest that moved with every hard breath she took and tightened his grip on Failure.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kwajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">He squeezed out all his strength and aimed at the skull of a vampire.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The vampires’ aggro fell on him and they simultaneously stared at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Crazy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hey! How can the leader die first? We should be the first ones to die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The terrified party members moved towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pant... Pant...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t say anything.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He kept panting as he wielded his sword towards the vampires.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The only good thing was that Lifael’s Spear wasn’t affected by his tiredness and hovered beside him. Grid would’ve died sooner if it wasn’t for Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Sigh, one last rampage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner was stimulated by Grid and grabbed his shield.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had already consumed his invincible skill and couldn’t even use basic defense skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Potion? He took them every time the cooldown ended.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The other members were the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Die!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The vampires unleashed an onslaught.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The three True Blood vampires were at the center.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Vantner wanted to block their attacks with his shield, but he was forced down.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The other party members also killed two or three vampires before reaching their limits. They allowed attacks and their health quickly sank to the bottom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Jishuka!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The enemies penetrated through the collapsed front line and aimed at Jishuka.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Zednos squeezed out the last of his mana, but the wind failed to be of any help to Jishuka.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hah... Hah...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The party members could only await death.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Just as the vampires were about to take away the last of their health.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">There was a splendid pillar of light. It was the signal that someone had levelled up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That someone was naturally...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You’ve been waiting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Congratulations!]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have reached level 300 and achieved the third stats awakening!]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[For every point of stamina, health will increase by 25 and defense will increase by 0.9.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[For every point of strength, health will increase by 7 and attack will increase by 0.6.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[For every point of intelligence...]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[One of Pagma’s Descendant’s hidden pieces ‘Sealed Ability’ has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The skill ‘Item Combination’ has been acquired.]</span></p>
