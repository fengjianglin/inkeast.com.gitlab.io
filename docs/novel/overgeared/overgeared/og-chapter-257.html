 <p><span style="">Chapter 257</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">The task of the Yatan Church was to create chaos in the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was to create an environment where dark magic was activated by drawing out the pain and despair in people’s hearts, then bringing the 33 great demons to the earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the will of God Yatan.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Three years ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Emperor Juander recruited top healers and priests from all over the continent.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was to save Empress Aria, who was on her deathbed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But nobody could heal Aria. The healers and priests said it was impossible unless the legendary Saintess appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The gold piled up like a mountain and the imperial treasures didn’t help.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Aria, the mother of the imperial princes and princesses. Juander had to watch as his dear wife died.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After Aria died.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Juander truly loved her, so he fell into a deep sorrow.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He neglected the affairs of the empire, drank every night, and became ill. It was his 2nd Empress, Marie, who comforted him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was the mother of the 4th Imperial Prince and had an intense beauty.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to her devotion, Juander managed to overcome his grief.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From then on, Marie’s world opened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Juander overcame his sense of loss thanks to Marie. Therefore, he favored Marie and her power skyrocketed into the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the prelude to a common story.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Marie did all types of things in order to make her son the next in line.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Using her beauty, power, and the black magicians under her, she did all types of wicked things, including dissolving the Red Knights and nobles who supported the 1st Imperial Prince.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now three years had passed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Marie had an incomparably strong support base compared to the past. Numerous nobles supported her and the 4th Prince, while the reorganized Red Knights were loyal to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Marie was satisfied. She had no doubt that her son would be the next emperor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the one who laughed at her was her closest black magician, Dive. </span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A black magician who served Marie’s family before she became an empress.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In fact, he had died in the past.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was at the hand of the 7th Servant, Dark Bus.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dark Bus was currently pretending to be Dive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was the best at curses in the Yatan Church, and his mission was to confuse the Saharan Empire.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“It won’t be long now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Once the 4th Prince, who lacked adaptability, became their heir, the forces supporting the 1st Prince wouldn’t be able to endure it and a bloody battle would take place in the empire.&nbsp;</span><span style="">What would happen if the empire fell into chaos?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Many people would feel despair or die, and the black magic would come to life.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It would be enough magic power to call up a great demon!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will soon be compensated for my hard work over the last three years.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a really hard three years.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The empire’s magicians and sages were powerful, so he had to pay extra attention to avoid being noticed. He could never relax.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But now the hardships were over.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kulkulkul...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the moment when the old man’s laughter echoed in the dark room...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The extensive ward that he installed around Asmophel’s mansion was destroyed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dark Bus perceived this and panicked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Intruder?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Asmophel was a useful tool.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was once praised for being a pillar of the empire, and his emotional despair was very strong after setting up Piaro as a traitor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dark Bus was obliged to maintain Asmophel’s brainwashing. Therefore, he stayed in Asmophel’s mansion to watch and protect him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">For the past several years, he had been careful to prevent any outsider from stepping foot into Asmophel’s mansion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But at this moment, his amulet was destroyed and an intruder was allowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘My wards were broken so easily?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was rare for someone to have this power on the continent. The person would certainly be a great force.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">But his magic power detected only one intruder. He didn’t have to be too nervous.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dark Bus recovered his composure. He went to the living room and found the knights.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Red Knights had finished their shift and had swapped with the Black Knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Great!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a crisis so Dark Bus needed those he could trust.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dark Bus found it hard to direct the Red Knights. They were too proud.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dark Bus was accompanied by only the Black Knights and left the mansion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Attention!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soldiers standing on the edge of the gardens found Dark Bus’ group and saluted. The soldiers weren’t yet aware of the presence of an intruder.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'It’s a covert intrusion...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But it was useless in front of Dark Bus. He could detect the enemy’s position with his magic power.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ssik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Dark Bus smiled and shouted to the Black Knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Intruder! Gather your power and take a defensive posture!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Once the command was received, the soldiers rushed to the entrance of the mansion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were 120 elite soldiers, two Black Knights and Dark Bus; it was a truly spectacular sight.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Paruru.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Dark Bus used his powerful magic power to detect the intruder.&nbsp;</span><span style="">200 meters ahead.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Reveal yourself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dark Bus shouted and released his magic power, causing the intruder to be revealed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a man wearing a bizarre type of robe and a mask covered his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Who?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Black hair and red eyes shining in the darkness. A person he had never seen before.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The intruder, Grid, answered Dark Bus’ question.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“What else? An enemy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t speak for long.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It took him three weeks to get here, so he didn’t want to waste time when he had reached the quest’s end point.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Tadat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid gradually narrowed the 200m distance to the soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The elite soldiers of the empire were calm. They pulled out their swords and took the posture of the Imperial Swordsmanship. The soldiers in the rear of the mansion shot fire arrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Fairly good.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid admired. The soldiers seemed to have a very high level compared to those he had previously seen.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘But so what?’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaeeeeeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">He used the Divine Shield to defend against the arrows, then he swapped the shield with Failure.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jjeejeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ku...heok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Five soldiers groaned and were thrown into the air as the blue-white Failure moved.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s strength transcended an ogre, and was at a level that the soldiers couldn’t afford to go against.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wahhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The other soldiers moved forward, trampling on their colleagues.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Grid used a skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Blacksmith's Rage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Blacksmith’s Rage Lv. 4 increased Grid’s attack power by 25% and his attack speed by 40%.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was also Failure’s option that ‘increased attack power by 20% in the dark.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Seokeok!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kwajijik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Under the moonlight, the sword sliced through the armour and shields, damaging the bodies of the soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was an overwhelming dance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The fatalities would keep increasing if they attacked in ones or twos. There was no chance of victory.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The soldiers surrounded Grid and exchanged signals to attack from all sides.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid laughed as the soldiers prepared a circular formation to isolate him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can break through with power.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The concept of tactics was different in the face of a clear difference in power. He could kill more than half of them if he used Transcended Link.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid knew it was a foolish thing to waste skills against these minor opponents. But he also didn’t want to waste stamina fighting them one by one.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Let’s take it easy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">During the past three weeks, Grid’s experience had increased from constant hunting and levelling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s vision expanded and he now looked at the entire battlefield. There were flower beds, trees and fountains all over the garden. Grid moved towards the most complex terrain, in order to make it difficult for the opponent to pass.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The formation of the soldiers following him slowly collapsed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The two or three soldiers chasing after him? They died from the greatsword before they could approach Grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kyaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soldiers were unable to take advantage of their superior numbers as Grid ran through the garden.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The soldiers shrank back as the flesh and blood of their colleagues scattered.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They no longer tried to chase Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Black Knights determined the flow and asked Dark Bus.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Sir Dive, please use curse magic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dark Bus replied and quickly drew a red magic circle. It was the appearance of a magic circle that dramatically increased black magic casting speed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dark Bus completed the magic circle and started successively casting curses.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Amplify Damage! Lower Resist! Lower Blessing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the moment when curse magic that had tremendous power, such as increasing the damage received, reducing resistance and reducing stats all hit Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Black Knights moved.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were confident that they could destroy the weakened intruder in 10 seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dark Bus hurriedly exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-Wait a minute...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The curse magic didn’t work!&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, he had no time to say this.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Black Knights who transcended human physical abilities were already close to Grid. Grid faced them and sent them a disturbing smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Restraint.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An unknown fear dominated the Black Knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Black Knights were confused and backed away.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid stepped away from the fountain and narrowed the distance to them using the footwork of Kill.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Black Knight pierced by the blue greatsword couldn’t even scream.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A large amount of blood spilled out as the black knight flopped down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Crazy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The other Black Knight cried out as he saw his colleague hit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">He barely escaped from the influence of Restraint.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You! What type of black magic did you use?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Black magic?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid contemplated the Black Knights.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Vital Spot Detection of the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch was activated, and the red light became darker.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This is a technique, not black magic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Seven golden blades appeared behind Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Puuoooook!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">It was a perfect accuracy and speed that was hard to respond to.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The golden blades persistently aimed at the seams of the Black Knight’s armor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The movements of the Black Knight slowed down as blades were inserted in the joints, then Grid used Link.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The Black Knight tried his best.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He swung the sword in his hand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Resistance was hopeless.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Link was currently level 5.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The ability of the level 255 Black Knight couldn’t resist it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">10, 15, 20, 25, 30 times.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dozens of energy blades sliced apart the body of the Black Knight in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cough...!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Plop!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The ragged Black Knight stumbled and fell into the fountain.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The soldiers were at a loss for words as they saw the blood spreading.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Two of the Black Knights that represented the empire had died in the blink of an eye? Was it an impossible dream?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The soldiers thought they were having a nightmare.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Dark Bus had been baffled that his curse magic didn’t work. Now he belatedly noticed Grid’s identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Resisting curses, that blue greatsword and the golden blades...! Yes! He’s the one Balak told me about!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Fifth Servant of the Yatan Church, Balak.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He invaded Bairan along with the Fourth Servant, Neberius, and was defeated.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that time, Balak had said.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In Bairan, there is a monster that users a blue greatsword and golden artifact.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He killed Malacus and Neberius.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He called himself...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Templar...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Overgeared!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Why was this person here?&nbsp;</span><span style="">He should be in the Eternal Kingdom, so why did he come to the empire to interfere with Dark Bus?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Do you intend to waste my three years of hard work?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Dark Bus was frustrated. He wondered if God Yatan had abandoned him.</span></p>
