 <p><span style="">Chapter 39</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">One-sided cheering!&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid actually became more excited.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A weed would grow stronger once it was trampled on.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I will win! Then I will make all of you shut up!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid completed the smelting and started the process of making the dagger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina became nervous as he started to tap the steel with his hammer. It was because she hadn’t finished smelting yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Fast! The difference in our skills is too large.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was inevitable.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the first place, was Euphemina a blacksmith?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I shouldn’t be hasty. It isn’t good to be too urgent.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina calmly focused on the process of smelting. Grid had repeated the quenching and forging process several times by the time she finished smelting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then she pulled out a hammer from her inventory.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She had bought this hammer for a lot of money, in order for this quest to be successful.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Blessed Blacksmith Hammer]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 299/300 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 50~70 &nbsp;&nbsp;Odds of Making a Rare Rated Item: +15% &nbsp;&nbsp;Odds of Making an Epic Rated Item: +5%</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A hammer user by a prestigious blacksmith. It will assist the user in creating higher rated items.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 150 or higher. More than 100 strength. Intermediate blacksmith skill.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You can’t equip it because you don’t meet the item usage conditions.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina had enough strength and her level was high enough to &nbsp;use the ‘Blessed Blacksmith Hammer.’ But she wasn’t a blacksmith, so she didn’t have the intermediate blacksmith skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, that story would change once she duplicated Grid’s blacksmith skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina faced Grid who was concentrating on making a dagger and used Skill Observation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina smiled with satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If we both have the same blacksmith skill, it is likely that the person with a better production tool will win.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The hammer Grid was using was old and shabby, much worse than Euphemina’s hammer.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina was confident of her victory.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But the moment she thought that! She was shocked as she saw the notification window that popped up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The level of Skill Observation is too low.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You can’t analyze the skill of the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Currently, Euphemina’s Skill Observation was level 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her skill wouldn’t fail, even if she observed a third advancement NPC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Above all, her skill was only level 5 when she analyzed and copied the skill of an advanced level blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, Grid’s blacksmith skill was impossible to observe with the level 7 Skill Observation?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Surely Grid’s blacksmith skill wasn’t at the advanced level?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...It can’t be. Skill Observation! Skill Observation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The level of Skill Observation is too low.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You can’t analyze the skill of the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The level of Skill Observation is too low.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You can’t analyze the skill of the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No matter how many times she used Skill Observation, the same notification windows repeatedly appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This must be a bug. Skill Observation!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The level of Skill Observation is too low.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You can’t analyze the skill of the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She used the skill until her mana was low, but her face was pale as she failed to complete the analysis.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Unbelievable..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina had to admit it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This stupid man actually had the skills of an advanced blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Is he a craftsman? That absolutely can’t be!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The 1st ranked person on the blacksmith rankings was only at the intermediate level. Yet Grid, who she’d never heard of, had skills beyond a ranker. It was impossible.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Craftsmen were rare even among NPC blacksmiths.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Yes, he is a blacksmith, not a craftsman. But why would my skill fail to analyze if he is a blacksmith? D-Don’t tell me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina made a hypothesis.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid wasn’t an ordinary blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She couldn’t rule out the possibility that this stupid man might have a hidden class like herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I don’t want to believe it, but it is reasonable.’ Otherwise, I can’t explain why Skill Observation can’t analyze this man’s skill.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In addition to blacksmiths, the rankings of all production classes were currently at the intermediate level.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even the most famous NPCs only had advanced level skills, and craftsman NPCs were extremely rare.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If Grid was an ordinary user, it was impossible for him to master the craftsmanship skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina was forced to believe that Grid wasn’t an ordinary blacksmith. Rather, he had a blacksmith-related class above the epic rating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It isn’t a rare class. I can replicate the skills of a rare class since I have an epic class. The minimum must be an epic class. But except for me, the only other epic classes are Agnus and Katz... Surely that guy doesn’t have an unique class? When did a unique class emerge?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was really the worst case scenario.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She had been thinking too lightly when she accepted a quest with an unknown level of difficulty.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Completely outrageous. I never expected to compete with a unique class!’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina fell into a confused state.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What should I do? I can’t do anything like this and will fail the quest.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She couldn’t even start making an item because she didn’t have the blacksmith skill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">She knew how to make it, but the end result would be absolutely rubbish without the assistance of the blacksmith skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Should I give up? Again?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She faced a situation where she had to give up another quest after ‘Agent of Revenge.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina thought this was truly the worst.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid belatedly discovered that she wasn’t doing anything and mocked her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“What? Are you completely frozen? Are you jealous of my skills, Kid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ohh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Anger formed on Euphemina’s face again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I can’t be defeated by a lowly man like this!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If things continued like this, Grid would win.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She needed to find a blacksmith and duplicate their blacksmith skills.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘But where can I find a blacksmith...? Ah!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina had a good idea and suddenly glanced at the audience.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rabbit was aware of the strange turn of events and approached her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is there a problem?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina whispered into Rabbit’s ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Who is Grid’s mentor? Call that person up on stage as well. Then make him help Grid with the dagger production.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was an absurd demand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rabbit’s eyes narrowed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Why? I can’t understand your intentions."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina explained with an embarrassed expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I can’t say anymore because it is a personal matter, but please listen to my request. It will increase my chances of winning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hrmm...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It would increase her chances of winning?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Rabbit wasn’t easily convinced. But what could he do? The game had already begun. There would be a lot of accusations if he tried to change the competition now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘In the first place, I have no substitute.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the end, Rabbit was forced to listen to Euphemina’s demands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will try.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rabbit spoke to the host who yelled towards the audience.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Mr. Khan! Come up on stage! Erina stated that she wants you to add your strength to Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A truly shocking proclamation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Confusion appeared on Grid’s face as there was an uproar.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? Erina wants to compete 2 against 1?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That guy called Grid must be very bad. Therefore, Erina felt pity and called Grid’s mentor to the stage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is she saying that they have to join forces for this to be a proper competition?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow, that is truly great confidence. She’s a wonderful woman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The crowd misunderstood and became more firmly entrenched on Euphemina’s side.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">She was worshipped as a benevolent and confident queen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">On the other hand, Grid’s pride was dented and his hostility towards Euphemina became stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This chick dares do this...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan walked over to the agitated Grid and said,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Calm down. This is a great opportunity for us. Let’s fight her together as she demanded.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid puffed up.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"What? Do you really think I will lose to her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“How can that be? I believe that you can win over anyone. Aren’t you Pagma’s Descendant?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Then why are you following her demands?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I respect you as a blacksmith. I would like to have the honor to work with you. In addition, my blacksmith’s heart wants to help instead of just watching. Grid, this is a request. I won’t hold you back, so please give me this opportunity to protect my smithy with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid couldn’t refuse after hearing Khan’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...As long as we’re together, we will succeed. Let’s crush that girl in front of all these people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The two people teamed up. In particular, Khan was overjoyed at being able to work with Grid in front of so many people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will demonstrate the best skills as your assistant! Give me a command.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was definitely a blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As Khan prepared to help Grid, Euphemina activated Skill Observation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have successfully analyzed ‘Advanced Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship’ Lv.2.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was as planned.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina smiled as an analysis of Khan’s blacksmith skill appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Skill Duplication!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have successfully duplicated ‘Advanced Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship’ Lv.2.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The skill ‘Advanced Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship’ Lv. 2 is available to use once. You can keep it permanently until it is used.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In the first place, the result of the blacksmith game depended on chance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even if Grid had superior blacksmith skills, it didn’t mean he would unconditionally make a high rated item.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In addition, Euphemina had the Blessed Blacksmith Hammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘There is still a chance.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina became engrossed in the production of the dagger.</span></p>
