 <p><span style="">Chapter 38</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Winston’s Central Square!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was originally crowded, but even more people were gathered today.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The item making game between blacksmiths would occur here.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I hope that Grid can win and protect Khan’s smithy. That smithy is the last pride that we have left.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"That's right. If the smithy falls into the hands of the Mero Company, our place in Winston will completely disappear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid, have strength! You absolutely can’t lose.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The hearts of the Winston residents gathered together. They prayed that Grid would win the game.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, the users’ attitudes were different. The result of the game had nothing to do with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“An item production game? There isn’t anything else interesting, so why don’t we watch for a while?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I don’t have anything else to do. &nbsp;If it isn’t fun, then we can just go. Somebody win~. The winner will be on this side~.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">As a result, most users just thought of the game as slightly interesting.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Hey, isn’t it funny when you think about it? Blacksmiths making items, why are so many people going to watch it?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes. It’s tedious to watch a blacksmith make items, not interesting. The item created will be epic at the most, so I’m not even interested in the result.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Where is an epic rated item? It’s good if they could even make a rare rated item. I heard rumors that no famous blacksmiths are participating.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? Then what is the goal? Why should we care about the results? Hey, this is a waste of time, so let’s just go hunting. Anyway, who cares about who owns the smithy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The users mocked the game as trivial and turned away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Once the participants of the game were revealed, the male users no longer thought of leaving.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Now! Let me introduce the main characters of this match. From the Mero Company, Erina! And Khan’s successor, Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ohhhhhhh!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The eyes of the male users widened as they saw the blonde girl climbing onto the stage and they started cheering.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow. Really pretty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is this love at first sight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“My ideal type...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The blonde girl was wearing a hat. However, she showed off a beauty that couldn’t be hidden, even with her face not completely exposed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her mouth was especially attractive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The male users, who weren’t interested in the result of the game originally, became her avid supporters the moment they saw her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Erina. I will cheer for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Erina, please win~.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Erina! Erina! Erina!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The male fan club formed in an instant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Erina, or Euphemina, shrugged as she watched their sky-piercing cheers and waved her hand gracefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Thank you for your support.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ohhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She smiled softly, making her seem like a goddess to the men.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was reminiscent of the reaction of soldiers towards the visit of girl group idols.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid sucked in a deep breath at the sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is it my turn next?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The male users were rooting for the female contestant. Then it was natural for the female users to support and cheer on the male contestant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid smiled and followed Euphemina’s actions by waving towards the female users in the audience.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid expected the cheers of female users.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But their reaction was much different than expected.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What is that guy doing? Uhh, I feel bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The bread that I ate a while ago feels like it’s coming back up...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"He looks really horrible...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The reactions from the female users were the worst!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'This dirty society that only cares about looks! You would support me properly if I was handsome.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">None of the women supported him, but the residents of Winston shouted towards the frustrated Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid! You have us. We are cheering for you. We believe in you! Be sure to win.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Khan’s successor, show off your skills.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid’s victory! Grid’s victory! Grid’s victory!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘If you are supporting me, why are your gazes directed towards her...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">NPC males were wolves as well.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Among the residents of Winston, the men forgot that the blonde girl was an enemy and couldn’t keep their eyes off her.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Even Khan!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘These bastards, I am now aware of your real state.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A blonde girl who was so seductive that she even attracted elderly NPCs.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid felt resentful towards her, as he turned into a squid just from standing next to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You. I will surely win. Then I’ll enjoy seeing that pretty face distort!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina was amazed by Grid’s declaration.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was a man she was meeting as an enemy, but how could he ignore her beauty?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Unless the person is gay or blind, isn’t it natural for all men to support my beauty?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina had a proud nature.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Taste my beauty properly.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina lifted the brim of the hat she used to hide her identity. Her beautiful face was clearly revealed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was forced to admire it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Looking at her like this, she is really pretty. Isn’t she comparable to that wicked witch, Yura?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If Yura was an elegant and mature woman, Euphemina was a youthful and refreshing girl.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Their atmosphere was quite different, but they were similar in that both of them had a transcendent beauty.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Is she a human or a doll?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid made a stupid expression and was unable to keep his eyes off of Euphemina.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina saw it and thought.&nbsp;</span><span style="">‘Yes, that’s right. Once you see my face, you will fall at first sight. Now you will follow me like a dog, just like the other men.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">There was no man in the world who could go against her beauty!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina had huge pride in her looks. She continued to speak to Grid in order to perfectly capture her victory.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Grid? There is no need to be hostile towards me. Haven’t we just met? Perhaps we will see each other again. In the future, we might develop a good relationship? So don’t be upset and let’s get along.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">She had half moon eyes and a slyly flirting voice.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There was no man who wouldn’t be into her when she acted like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Grid just snorted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“What? Develop a good relationship? Don’t say such horrible things, Kid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina’s face turned red.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"H-Horrible? Why wouldn’t you develop a good relationship with me? In addition, kid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes! I don’t want to develop a good relationship with a fox like you! Kid! Have you even graduated from high school? I have no interest in a little person like you. I’m not a lolicon! Shit. Do you think that I am such a slimy bastard? It might be your intention to keep me from concentrating on the game, but I won’t fall for it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was firm.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had an ideal type. Her height should be at least 168cm and her chest should be a D cup!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina was definitely pretty but she was far from Grid’s ideal type.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Her natural height was 160cm. Her chest was only a B cup.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No matter how good her face was, there was no reason for Grid to fall for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Kid? Fox? What is with this person?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina stared blankly as she listened to Grid’s ridicule, before suddenly shaking.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The sense of shame she never experienced before made her extremely angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘More than anything else, I am 20 years old!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right. Euphemina wasn’t a young girl. She looked younger than her age, but she was already an adult.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Being called a kid was touching on Euphemia’s sore spot, since she had a complex about her height.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I will disgrace you in front of all these people!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina decided as she was filled with anger.&nbsp;</span><span style="">She smiled coldly. Then she glanced at Grid and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Since you don’t realize my charm, are you gay? Okay. I will make you feel bitter about Mother Nature making you gay. Let’s see who will make the better item. But I’m going to win.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-What? Gay? I am gay? What the hell are you saying? This unlucky brat! I’m not gay!”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid shouted indignantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Euphemina heard another shock as she heard the word ‘unlucky.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">She never imagined the day would come when she would hear this from a man.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“U-Unlucky? Me? A trash-like man will never be able to match me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid was the one who insulted her first. From Euphemina’s point of view, Grid seemed like a madman.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina couldn’t cope with the shame and tearfully shouted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"I want to say goodbye to you as quickly as possible! Start the game now!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Okay, let's get started. I don’t care about this one-sided cheering. I will make you fail today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The host didn’t announce the start of the game but Grid already placed iron ore inside the burning furnace.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Euphemina experienced making items in the past so she also started smelting the metal.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Hwaruruk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">A huge momentum rose from the two angry people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The temperature of the furnace rose rapidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The host shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The two people have started the game. I will notify the crowd! This time, the theme is to make a dagger. The one who produces the better quality dagger within the time limit will be the victor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Daggers were items that could be made relatively quickly. It was good to spend a long time to create a real masterpiece, but skilled blacksmiths could complete a good dagger in two hours.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The time limit of this game was three hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Erina, fight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The number of users continued to increase as they heard the turmoil, causing Euphemina’s fans to multiply as rapidly as a cancer cell.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The cheers of the Winston residents were completely buried by their shouts, so Grid seemed to be fighting alone behind enemy lines.&nbsp;</span></p>
