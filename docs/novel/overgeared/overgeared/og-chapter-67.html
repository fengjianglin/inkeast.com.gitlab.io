 <p><span style="">Chapter 67</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">10 days before Grid left for Kesan Canyon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Kesan Canyon... Kesan Canyon... hrmm...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Kesan Canyon!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was one of the five forbidden zones of the Eternal Kingdom, a place where the monsters were terrible and monstrous. It was infamous even among high-level users because they could lose their lives without even knowing it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The level 80 warrior who visited Kesan Canyon to perform Earl Ashur’s quest was more aware of the dangers of Kesan Canyon than anyone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Going to Kesan Canyon with my current level is suicide. However, it will take too much time to raise my level by hunting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid missed the fun of hunting monsters and obtaining items and experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">But he had to raise money for his family that was in debt. He could sell one more item during the time he was hunting.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Should I just postpone the quest? Isn’t it better to make money than to do the quest? No, I can’t do that. This isn’t a regular quest that I can put off... if I postpone it, I will keep delaying it so it is wiser to solve it when I am determined. Hrmm, what is a good way to complete the quest within a short period of time?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid thought of an idea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Item creation...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A smiled appeared on Grid’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"This is the right time to use the Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation skill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation was a skill that allowed Pagma’s Descendant to design exclusive items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It meant that Grid could create a new item that didn’t exist in Satisfy yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What item will be useful in Kesan Canyon? I can’t go around Kesan Canyon with my current level.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid recalled the features of Kesan Canyon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">First of all, it was a deep canyon with rough winds and a steep slope that quickly wore down the traveler’s stamina. As a warrior, Grid couldn’t move for long and quickly fell into a critical state from exhaustion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">But Grid didn’t consider this part a big problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The current level 45 blacksmith Grid had a much higher stamina than the level 80 warrior Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘With my current strength and stamina, I won’t be easily tired in Kesan Canyon’s environment. The problem is the monsters.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The monsters of Kesan Canyon had a minimum level of 160. Monsters with fearful levels were hiding in caves all over the canyon and immediately exposed themselves at the discovery of travelers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Even if Grid had superior stats compared to his level, he couldn’t be safe from the monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I will be helpless in front of the canyon monsters, even with the Ideal Dagger. I need further weapons and armor. Yes, at the minimum, I need something like the Sword of Self-transcendence.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If he was equipped with a sword like Sword of Self-transcendence and armor, he could face the monsters in the canyon, even at level 45.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But was it easy to create something like the Sword of Self-transcendence?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘No, wait.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid changed his concept.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? If I think about it, do I have to fight the monsters in the canyon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That’s right. Grid was heading to Kesan Canyon to find Pagma’s swordsmanship, not hunt monsters. Rather, it was wiser to minimize his encounter with monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes! I need to create an item that helps me escape from monsters, not fight them! Something like an invisibility cloak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The invisibility cloak was a typical stealth item portrayed in games, cartoons, and movies. Of course, invisibility cloaks existed in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Around 200 years ago, the legendary tailor Kruger made five invisibility cloaks, two of which still reportedly existed. The person who wore the cloak could completely hide his or her appearance, so the value was naturally astronomical.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This is a really amazing idea! If I can create an invisibility cloak, Kesan Canyon won’t be a problem and I can earn a huge amount of money!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The terrace of the smithy’s second floor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had been resting there for a while and he suddenly got up. Then he rushed towards Khan who was working hard on the first floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Are there any materials suitable for making a stealth item?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan stopped hammering the iron, wiped his sweat and thought for a moment before answering.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“A material suitable for making a stealth item... I can only think about the silver dragon scales.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Silver dragon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Unlike other dragons, the silver dragons act cautiously and stealthily. The silver scales have a protective coloration and are famous for being invisible to human eyes. If you make an item with the scales, you will complete a great stealth item.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“But how can the scales be found if they can’t be seen with human eyes? No, in the first place, aren’t dragons the most powerful beings in the world? Isn’t it practically impossible to obtain a dragon’s scales.?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“That’s right. It is doubtful for a human to be able to find dragon scales. But isn’t it possible for Pagma’s Descendant? Haha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid thought for a moment before changing his question.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“What type of materials did the tailor Kruger use to make his invisibility cloaks in the past?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“I don’t know for sure, but I think he probably used the sylphid scales.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sylphid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sylphids are small air fairies. Their scales are suitable for making stealth items, just like a silver dragon’s scales. However, a dragon’s scales are harder than anything else in the world, so it isn’t strange to classify it as a mineral. However, the sylphid scales are thin and closer to cloth. In other words, the sylphid scales should be more for a tailor than a blacksmith.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Cloth...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Certainly, a blacksmith specialized in smelting minerals or making leather goods, not cloth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But Grid was Pagma’s Descendant, not a conventional blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Won’t it be possible for me? Let’s check it once. Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation Skill]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">You can create three equipment item production methods every time the skill level of the ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill’ goes up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Number of items that can be created at present: 5/6.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* When items are produced using this skill, the name of the creator is automatically placed on the item.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[What item do you want to create?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had sealed the Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation for a while after creating ‘Failure.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid took a deep breath before answering the notification window’s question.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“A cloak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Have you decided?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[What materials would you like to use?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Sylphid scales.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">If Pagma’s Descendant was unable to make cloth-based items, a notification window would pop up saying something like ‘You can’t make an item using the sylphid scales as a material.’&nbsp;</span><span style="">Fortunately, such warning messages didn’t pop up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Have you decided?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid replied with delight,</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Okay!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Please design the item.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Good!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A blank blueprint appeared in front of him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid already experienced this once, so he calmly drew the picture.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I don’t like a simple cloak because it is too bland. Should I put a hood on the cloak? Ugh, no. A cloak with a hood reminds me of the archaic garb of priests. Hmm, what if it isn’t a cloak but a hoodie? Won’t it be comfortable and look good? I prefer a zip-up hoodie.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After a few moments.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">An image of a hooded zip-up that young people in modern society would wear was completed. Thanks to the correction effect, the design was so stylish that it reminded him of a hoodie made by some famous fashion designer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It will be amazing if I wear this! Won’t women look at me for once? No, no. Isn’t this an invisibility cloak? People won’t be able to see it when I wear it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid grumbled but pressed the ‘finish’ button at the bottom of the blueprint.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Have you decided? When you complete the blueprint, the number of available creation skill will decrease by one.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Progress."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Once he replied, numbers and languages quickly covered the blueprint. The system was calculating and complementing the lacking details in Grid’s design.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After a while, an improved and completed design appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Please describe the characteristics of the item.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Finally, it was the conclusion of the item creation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Unlike before with Failure, Grid calmly and clearly explained the characteristics.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The wearer can completely hide their appearance. Nobody can see me if I wear this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Please name the item.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Transparent Zip-up Hoodie... um, this is too messy. Let’s just say Clean Hooded Zip-Up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">['Have you decided on Transparent Zip-up Hoodie um This is too Messy Let’s just say Clean Hooded Zip-Up?]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“...Just call it the Hooded Zip-Up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid didn’t respond to the game maker’s sense of humor and the system responded normally.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Have you decided on ‘Hooded Zip-Up?’]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then the stylish appearance of a white hooded zip-up emerged as a hologram and the item options were listed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Hooded Zip-Up]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Durability: 61/61 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 10</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Movement speed will increase by 30%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Wind resistance will increase by 20%.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A cloak designed by a legendary blacksmith. However, the appearance is different from the normal look of a cloak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Thanks to the sylphid scales being used as the material, affinity with wind and movement speed will increase. You can hide while wearing it, but the stealth will be turned off when an enemy is attacked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Conditions of Use: None.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Weight: 5&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Keok...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid simply wanted to design a stealth item.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In addition to the hiding function, he never expected the stunning options such as increased movement speed and wind resistance.</span></p>
