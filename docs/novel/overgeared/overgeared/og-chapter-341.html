 <p><span style="">Chapter 341</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had done his best in the duel to persuade Piaro. He took out all the cards he had and realized one thing in the process of defeat.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The suitable weapon for more advanced swordsmanship was a one-handed sword, not a greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘The relatively big and heavy greatsword’s trajectory is simple and limited.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s basic battle style was to repeatedly hit. Therefore, he preferred a greatsword with strong destructive power.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pagma's Descendant had a damage oriented skill tree, so the greatsword was very good for that.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However, Grid felt the limitations.&nbsp;</span><span style="">From Elfin Stone to Braham and Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The appearance of unmatched powerhouses meant that his previous way of fighting became ineffective.&nbsp;</span><span style="">So what about strong destructive power?&nbsp;</span><span style="">It couldn’t deal with the strong opponents!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'I need to familiarize myself with one-handed swords.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He obtained the strongest one-handed sword, Iyarugt, which wasn’t lacking in power compared to a greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style="">After the confrontation with Piaro, Grid devoted himself to training with the one-handed sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What if it was the him in the past? ‘How annoying. All I need is items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid would think that, but now it was different. He did his best to get used to one-handed swords, just like when he made items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">This change was possible because he had a desire to become stronger.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Compared to the old days, I increased my control skills and didn’t neglect training.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He was arrogant.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He learned today that against Chucksley, a knight he’d never heard of, his techniques didn’t work. Iyarugt gave him the best sword trajectory, but he could only hold on.&nbsp;</span><span style="">To be honest, it was quite frustrating for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He judged that it was hard to overcome Chucksley without the help of the God Hands.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But this place was in the middle of the enemies.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He didn’t know when other enemies would attack, so he had to place the God Hands on the defensive.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Then the situation changed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Allies arrived and the enemies had fallen into confusion.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The focus on Grid was eased.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid used that chance to deploy Magic Missile that he’d saved as a trump card and managed to shake off Chucksley.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He pursued Chucksley’s ally and this became the bait.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuk...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chucksley was hit by Kill and his health gauge fell to two-thirds.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid took great damage when enduring the blow to grab Chucksley’s neck, and blood was pouring from his chest. But his health gauge wasn’t reduced at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was the power of the Holy Light Armor and Doran’s Ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid sensed the power of the Rising Sword used by Chucksley and wore Doran’s Ring in advance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was the judgment ability he was able to exert due to the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">The ability to use this item perfectly would impress rankers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid smiled coolly and whispered to Chucksley.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Have you heard of being overgeared?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Overgeared?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">What did that mean?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid used such difficult terms to understand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">To Chucksley, Grid was an intellectual.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I thought he was ignorant because he was a commoner, but he uses such complicated jargon...!'</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was incredibly frustrating to listen to.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Four golden hands flew around Chucksley, who was unable to interpret the meaning of overgeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The golden hands were moving and wielding their weapons by themselves.&nbsp;</span><span style="">There were three of them?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chucksley detected the danger and shook off Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid was unable to suppress him with force and shouted without any delay.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Magic Missile!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Jiing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s magic power gathered at the tips of the four hands.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">White flashes of light flew out and hit Chucksley.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Kuaaaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chucksley felt a pain that couldn’t be ignored.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The Magic Missiles launched by the golden hands contained incredible power for low-grade magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chucksley couldn’t understand it at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why is the resistance of my White Armor being ignored!?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Lokan family that Chucksley came from had served the Eternal royal family for generations.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had countless achievements and received the praise and recognition of people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">One of the things he received was the White Armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The armor boasted good physical defense and high magic resistance, so it easily blocked variables.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chucksley was always invincible in war when wearing this armor.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He crushed the enemy’s physical attacks with his sword and resisted the enemy’s surprise magic attacks with his armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">However!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Cough! Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">This low level spell penetrated his armor and dealt a perfect blow?&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, Pagma's Descendant was a blacksmith, so how could he use magic in the first place?&nbsp;</span><span style="">The secret must be in the gold hands!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘What is the identity of those golden hands...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chucksley’s head was a mess as he coughed up blood.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He wasn’t able to figure out Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It felt like he was facing a person on a different dimension.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Yes, this was the feeling he’d had using the Reinhardt golem invasion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Why...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He had trained in swordsmanship until he vomited blood and as a result, he got the title of great swordsman.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The person who was once called the greatest swordsman, Piaro, had disappeared.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there was still such a gap between them?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This is a legend!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hadn’t Grid already become a legend?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid’s growth should already be over and he should become stagnant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Why...? Why have you become stronger?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s eyes were different from when they first met.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid no longer ignored Chucksley and respected him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He honored the strong.&nbsp;</span><span style="">That’s why he spoke honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I am still weak."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid defeated the golems who were threatening the kingdom and now overcame Chucksley!&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then what were these words?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chucksley was agitated as Grid repeated something he had heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“The world is wide and there are many strong people. You will know if you ever meet a real powerhouse one day. How incomplete I am.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Braham and Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Compared to them, he wasn’t a legend.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He had yet to achieve his full growth.&nbsp;</span><span style="">One reason was that he couldn’t complete the class quest, but Grid knew the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘It isn’t because of the class quests.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was because he didn’t have the ability to progress through the class quests.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If it was Yura or Huroi, they wouldn't have been stupid enough to be stuck for such a long time on one quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I have no talent.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">He didn’t have control skills like Regas and Faker, or the ability to raise his level like Jishuka or Pon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid didn’t have any advantages that would be his weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The reason he was able to get to his current position was his tenacity.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Without that tenacity, Grid wouldn’t have become Pagma’s Descendant and would still be ordinary. No, he would’ve still been a low level user.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Well, I mean... I will devote myself more and more. As long as I can survive here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Killing intent filled Grid’s eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Respect for the strong?&nbsp;</span><span style="">This was enough.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid had no intention of forgiving the enemy who dared to invade Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It wasn’t simply due to the threat of losing his territory.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Reidan had 20,000 people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The people had an infinite affection towards him.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The enemies in front of him were trying to harm those people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He couldn’t forgive them. No, he couldn’t tolerate their existence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Grid, everything is ready.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">The composition of the battlefield had transformed to the ideal form.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Reidan’s soldiers fired arrows without a break and reduced the number of royal soldiers, while Laden and the northern army tied up their feet.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then Lauel cast the strongest skill of a third advancement qigong master, ‘Master of Flow.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Now all that was left...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Please imprint on the world that your territory is off limits.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Y-Yes...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Lauel would take care of it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid decided to take Ferrell’s life first.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Ferrell was gasping due to his wounds and couldn’t resist the sword that pierced him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have defeated Viscount Ferrell, the best archer of the Eternal Kingdom.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Bon family will be forever hostile towards you.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[356,410,000 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[The Thunder Bow has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Your demonic power has increased by two.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ferrell!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Chucksley and Ferrell were fellows who relied on each other.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Chucksley gazed at Grid with hateful eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Grid thought this was ludicrous.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Don’t forget who caused this situation. You’re the ones who aimed your swords first. Forgetting the fact that I saved the kingdom, all of you are less than dogs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid looked arrogant and wicked.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The conditions to instill fear and regret in the enemy wasn’t just overwhelming power, but also attitude. He had been intentionally trained in this by Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“This guy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Viscount Ferrell!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Ferrel Shaiva du Bon.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The ruler of the family who ruled the Shaiva estate for generations and who had a high reputation.&nbsp;</span><span style="">His death would be enough to buy the wrath of the Shaiva estate and the royal family.&nbsp;</span><span style="">A huge 300 knights and soldiers headed towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Protect the duke!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Laden screamed and tried to move the army.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Grid raised his hand and stopped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Ohhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The isolated Grid gazed at the 300 enemies rushing towards him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Prince Ren watched the battlefield from where he was hiding among the escort knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'That guy, I will make him regret it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid started his sword dance.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was a enchanting sight as a sword dance was unfolded in the middle of a battlefield filled with blood and flesh... No, he seemed like a madman who couldn’t grasp the mood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Wave!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style="">Kurururu!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style="">Iyarugt had a higher attack speed than the greatsword. It exerted havoc in a long battle, but it was forced to fall behind a greatsword when it came to single attack skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid had swapped to Grid’s Greatsword the moment he started the sword dance. Grid’s Greatsword was a superior weapon with the best attack power, and an option effect that increased the damage of skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t possible for the 300 troops from the Shaiva estate to endure the black waves spreading all over the place.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘This monster!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Grid’s eyes gleamed with a red light and caused infinite fear inside Prince Ren.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, Prince Ren endured it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Don’t overdo it! Time is on our side!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After a while.&nbsp;</span><span style="">If they waited a little longer, the 2,000 soldiers would cross the Altes Mountains and hit Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Also!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Grid! Your wife will enter my hands soon!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Until then, they just needed to endure.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Prince Ren was confident that he would win the war with this web-like strategy.</span></p>
