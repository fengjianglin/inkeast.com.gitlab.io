 <p><span style="">Chapter 96</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style=""> [You have joined the Tzedakah Guild.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Guild Name: Tzedakah</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Level: 5 (57,630,440/100.588.127)</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Reputation: 612,140</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Master: Jishuka</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Number of Members: 18/80</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Affiliation: None</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Alliances: None</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Hostile Relationships: Rio Kingdom/ Fire Dragon Trauka/ Yatan Church/ Iron Style Group/ Helding Clan/ Couch Clan</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Inclination: Neutral</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Territory: None</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was very disappointed when I checked the guild information window that popped up when I joined the guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What is this? The number of members is small since it is a group of elites, but you don’t have any alliances or territory? And why do you have so many hostile relationships? Why is a red dragon hostile to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"We haven’t felt the need to make an alliance yet, and there are many enemies due to quests and raids. Umm, don’t worry about the red dragon. He won’t do anything unless we enter his territory.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Putting all that aside, why don’t you have a territory? As a top level guild, shouldn’t the Tzedakah Guild have a territory?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It had been one year since Satisfy opened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Some top guilds belonged to certain countries and built up their achievements, receiving territory from the kings or nobles.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were barren land, but depending on how the guild manages and develops it, the land could become a city in the future and huge taxes could be collected from it.&nbsp;</span><span style="">In other words, the acquisition of a territory was one of the ultimate goals of a guild. Therefore, it was natural to wonder why the Tzedakah Guild didn’t have a territory.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka explained.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Grid, you are mistaken. Our guild is the strongest guild, not a top guild. There are fewer guild members so there is a limit to how much we can raise our guild level, as you can see by our low guild level. The level of the top guilds is estimated to be around 7~8 right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow... A bad guild with low level and no territory... How can this guild make me rich?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It seemed like I joined the wrong guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I should leave.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A man entered the smithy when I decided to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Listen to a person’s words to the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was Pon who played an active part in the raid against Malacus.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Our guild might be low in level, but we have steadily built up a reputation as we progressed through quests and raids. Many nobles and nations know about us, and we have received countless offers of territory from them. We just refused.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I didn’t understand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"You refused the territory?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Other guilds were eager to snatch any territory they could. If they could get land, they would lick the feet of the nobles and royalty. Then why did the Tzedakah Guild refuse to accept the territory?</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I couldn’t understand it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Puhaha! You should bluff more moderately. Why would a guild say no to a territory?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Because of you.”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka pointed at me with her long fingers. Even her hand gesture was seductive.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"We had to make the entire continent our area of activity while searching for the unknown craftsman. That made it difficult to have a base and manage it. The nobles and royal families started to make suggestions about us becoming their subordinates around the time of your appearance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">In other words...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You gave up territory just to find me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Yes. But strictly speaking, we didn’t give it up. It is just on hold for a while. We can get territory in any country we want at any time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I never imagined how much the Tzedakah Guild needed me.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"But why do you want me so much? You know now that I have a hidden job, but at that time, didn’t you just know me as a blacksmith?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The reason we want you is because you're a blacksmith. Your hidden class is irrelevant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The average user level in Satisfy is 80. High-level users like us are just a fraction of the two billion users, so there is always a shortage of equipment available for high-level users. The items with the performance we want are rarely dropped through hunting or raids, so we have to rely on produced items...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Was it to welcome my new colleagues?&nbsp;</span><span style="">Khan kindly came out with refreshments.&nbsp;</span><span style="">He was an NPC, but Pon respectfully accepted the teacup given to him. Then he continued speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"A blacksmith who can produce high-level items is very rare. Among users, there are no advanced blacksmiths and even the advanced NPC blacksmiths are only available in major cities. In addition, advanced blacksmiths only have a low chance of making epic or higher rated items, so the burden of investing the materials and the commission fee is very high.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka took over.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Then epic rated arrows that not even advanced blacksmiths could make appeared. We thought that the maker had the ability to produce the items we wanted, so we earnestly searched for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Tzedakah Guild recognized my abilities first and searched for me.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I confirmed that I made the right decision in joining them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“We came looking for you. You have the ability we want.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">After that.&nbsp;</span><span style="">All 17 members of the Tzedakah Guild, including Jishuka and Pon, gathered at Khan’s smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Then they welcomed me with enthusiasm. All of them looked at me with expectant eyes, making me feel overwhelmed.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But unexpected, not one person asked about my class.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Isn’t anyone interested in my class?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka smiled gently.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It isn’t that we have no interest. Everyone, including myself, is curious about the exact class. But we won’t ask because we know that hidden classes are reluctant to disclose information about their class.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hoh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was really meticulous care.&nbsp;</span><span style="">As I started liking the guild more and more, Jishuka cut to the chase.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid, in the future, I want to commission items for the guild members. We want epic or higher rated items suitable for our level. We will buy the completed items for an appropriate price.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It is okay if you give me money. But it will take a while to obtain the materials and production methods required...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"If you tell us what you need, we will get it for you. You just have to worry about making it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">That was convenient.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Okay. But I don’t have a lot of capital, so I can’t make too many items at once.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Jishuka made a confused sound.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Capital? Why do you need capital? The guild will supply the materials and production methods. All you need is time and the technique.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“... Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Were they going to give me free materials and production methods? This sounded like a dream!&nbsp;</span><span style="">No, don’t get too excited. It was strange. It was suspicious that they were so nice from the beginning.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I couldn’t believe in people-especially women- because they might hit me in the back of the head!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I &nbsp;became wary of Jishuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“You’ll give me the materials for free and then buy the finished item from me? Why are you giving me the materials and production methods? Isn’t it just a loss for you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Hah?”&nbsp;</span><span style="">Jishuka was confused.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"What are you talking about? Aren’t you a blacksmith of our guild? It’s natural for the guild to support our blacksmith with materials and the production methods.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Regas laughed from where he was listening to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Grid, a competent blacksmith is a talent that all guilds covet. They have to give the blacksmiths the best treatment to prevent them from going to other guilds. It is obvious that a guild with a competent blacksmith will have a huge growth gap with a guild that doesn’t have one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Wow...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">A blacksmith class, wasn’t it a total honey-like class?&nbsp;</span><span style="">But this was only for competent blacksmiths!</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Blacksmiths are very difficult to grow... So the value of an exceptional blacksmith is very high. However, Pagma’s Descendant has fraudulent blacksmith skills so it honey...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I once again felt the greatness of a legendary class and appreciated it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘I want to start working.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was filled with enthusiasm and prompted Jishuka.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"So who am I making an item for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon raised his hand in a flash.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Vantner grabbed Pon’s hand. Then he raised his hand.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“No, me first!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Toban shouted.&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Of course, the master should be first! Then the chief of staff!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"What does chief of staff have to do with the sequence? Don’t abuse your authority.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">All members of the Tzedakah Guild were rankers. They all aimed at and desired to level up. Being armed with stronger items would make it faster and easier to hunt.&nbsp;</span><span style="">It was obvious that all of them wanted their item to be made first.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">No, I had to exclude Regas, who was laughing without saying anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Regas is a martial artist who trains his body, so it seems like he doesn’t care about items. That reminds me...’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I pointed to two men who couldn’t hide their uncomfortable expressions and Toban.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Toban. And you two.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The three people called became filled with anticipation. They misunderstood that I would make them items.&nbsp;</span><span style="">However, it was the opposite.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will make your items last.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“W-Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I explained to the surprised Toban,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Toban, you were nasty when I asked to join the Guardian of the Forest raid last time...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Heok? It was a few months ago, but you still remember? Strictly speaking, it was indifference, not nastiness!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Shh. And the other two...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I checked the IDs of the two people.&nbsp;</span><span style="">One was a Hispanic male with black hair called Rook, while the other was a slim, middle-aged man called Jeep.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"The two of you. Didn’t you come here before?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t long after the production making game with Euphemina.&nbsp;</span><span style="">They were the two people who entered Khan’s smithy to ask about Euphemina’s whereabouts.&nbsp;</span><span style="">At that time, they ignored me and disregarded Khan since he was an NPC.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Our relationship is like this, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I smiled and the two of them looked at each other before bowing and apologizing,&nbsp;</span><span style="">“We’re sorry for that time! We were so impatient that we were rude! We sincerely apologize!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"You need to apologize to Khan, not me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Khan was watching me and my new colleagues happily!&nbsp;</span><span style="">The two people apologized to Khan, but they didn’t really mean it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“What? Are you still ignoring NPCs? Well, regardless of whether you ignore NPCs or not, it doesn’t matter to me; however, Khan is different. Khan is my precious friend, and if you don’t respect him, I will never produce any items for you."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“... I’m sorry Khan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Please forgive us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rook and Jeep’s apologies were sincere this time, and it seemed that they realized that even an NPC could be a valuable asset to someone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘They will do well.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Well, I didn’t want to criticize them anymore because I also ignored NPCs that I didn’t need.&nbsp;</span><span style="">So the conclusion...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I want you to make a spear for Pon first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It was Jishuka’s will.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“As revealed in the Malacus raid, Pon currently has a low level weapon, so he can’t exert the maximum amount of power in a high-level raid. He is one of the pure physical damage dealers in our guild, so we have to prioritize his weapon."</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon approached.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I already have a method of making a spear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[’Gale Spear Production Method’ has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Gale Spear Production Method]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Prerequisite: Advanced Blacksmith Mastery Level 4.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">* Gale Spear: A spear made of mithril. It is very light so the more skilled the user, the more the power can be maximized. However, this lightness can be a disadvantage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">User Restriction: Level 240 or higher.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">‘Ohh!’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Following the Divine Shield, I got another free production method!&nbsp;</span><span style="">I failed to conceal my pleasure as Pon asked me carefully, </span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Is it possible?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I replied as if it was no big deal,&nbsp;</span><span style="">"Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">The Tzedakah Guild members were agitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It means he at least has Advanced Blacksmith Mastery level 4...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Isn’t the first ranked blacksmith still at the intermediate level?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"Is his excellent combat skills and mastery of blacksmith techniques because of the hidden class?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"It must be one of the best among the hidden classes...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I learned the production method in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[You have learned how to make the Gale Spear.]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">[Gale Spear]</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Rating: Rare ~ Legendary</span></p>

 <p><span style="">Weight: 200&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'Ohh, it is a good spear.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">It wasn’t inferior to the Sword of Self-transcendence that I made.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The materials required to make it...</span></p>
 <p><span style="">“Pon, in order to create one spear, I need 15kg of mithril ore, 1st tier high-grade Tipan wood and four griffin tendons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Pon made an excited sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">"I will acquire them for you now. Then while you are making the spear, I will look for the whereabouts of the Divine Shield that was stolen. So don’t worry about anything during the production.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I nodded with a much lighter heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="">“Okay. I will concentrate and make a good spear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="">I was standing on a stage.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The guild was filled with expectations for the creator of the Special Jaffa Arrows.&nbsp;</span><span style="">And I was ready to surprise them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="">'For some reason, I have a lot of confidence today.’</span></p>
 <p><span style="">Of course, there was a chance it might be ruined.&nbsp;</span><span style="">But there was no reason to be blamed if I made a rare rated item.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The result of the item produced was clearly luck.&nbsp;</span><span style="">So there was no need to be burdened.&nbsp;</span><span style="">I started to concentrate on my breathing.</span></p>
