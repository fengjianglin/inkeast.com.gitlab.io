 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Many may have noticed—the dwarven racial traits weren’t about strength and dexterity, but was instead an obsession that transcended death. It was the true power of the dwarves and the driving force behind the connection with their works. The desire for their works to be immortal masterpieces inspired them to inject their soul into their works.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was why the ego gear were the symbol of integrity. The ego gear, that only dreamed of being the best, was upright like a tall tree and led its master on the right path. At one time, the world sanctified the ego gear and their masters. Then the world soon found out—the fact that the wicked battle gear, classified as the so-called ‘Demonic Gear,’ also possessed egos.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“......!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grid was shocked. It was due to the screams of beasts that came from the deep passage after the entrance of Pandemonium was opened. It sounded creepy, sharp, and wicked. He would rather hear the screams of the great demons.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘...Is it the sound of the wind?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It happened as Grid was double-checking that it was the wind echoing in the darkness... &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The personalities of the egos were different just as humans were all different,” Antrino spoke as he watched Grid with interest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His hand touching his complicated braided beard was as delicate and beautiful as the hands of other dwarf craftsmen. In this world, it felt like the saying ‘slender and delicate hands’ existed only for the dwarves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is the mood of the creator when smelting the minerals? Depending on the purpose of the creator when tempering the mineral, upright and righteous egos, or malicious and murderous egos, can be born. We call the latter demonic gear and have sealed them here in Pandemonium.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grid was reminded of the Thorn of Deep Grievance. Originally, the Thorn of Deep Grievance was just an ordinary flamberge. Then after being abandoned by its maker, Grid, and left alone to one side of the smithy, it gradually harbored a grudge against Grid. Ibellin’s blood, filled with anger and shame, awakened the ego. The ego was filled with a grudge toward Grid and was very ferocious. The demonic gear sealed in Pandemonium would have their own story, just like the thorn.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The dwarf warriors slowly surrounded Grid. They were reluctant to expose Pandemonium, which could be called their shame, to an outsider. Surprisingly, it was King Charles who snapped at them. “Out of the way!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">King Charles’ bloodshot eyes were burning. His snow-white beard looked like it would melt. “A promise is a promise! Since he has opened the door of Pandemonium, let him enter and exit Pandemonium!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This wasn’t a favor. King Charles was plotting a reversal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Now, Pagma's Descendant.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have given you access to Pandemonium because you have promised to liberate the soul of the empress. However, if you do other things without liberating the soul of the empress, then I will properly punish you. Furthermore, regardless of your success or failure, I will be sure to take back the soul of the empress.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I kept my promise. You must keep your promise.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">King Charles sent him such a message and Grid lost his way to go back on his words. If Grid couldn’t liberate the soul of the empress, then not only would his life be in danger, an exchange with Talima would become unlikely.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘He’s pretty smart.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Like the other dwarves, King Charles had a capricious personality that didn’t observe the situation around him. However, his head worked in important moments. It was a style that would be very tiring if he left as an enemy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘...Instead, it is reassuring to be on the same side.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was a small smile on Grid’s face. In any case, the water has already been spilled. His relationship with Talima had become twisted from the moment the dwarf empress’ soul dwelled in the God Hands. However, there was now an opportunity to recover the water. It wasn’t necessary to regard the current situation negatively.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Okay, but you’ll need to make one promise.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If I liberate the empress’ soul, then apologize for all your rudeness so far.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“...Understood,” King Charles replied.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He also knew Grid’s identity. A blacksmith whose skill was acknowledged by God Hexetia...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">King Charles had clearly heard of Grid’s reputation, which made it all the way here even when they were isolated by Fire Dragon Trauka. It was right to apologize if Grid really liberated the empress’ soul and proved that he was different from Pagma.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘By the way, will the predator of Pandemonium really help him?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a monster thrown to the very end of Pandemonium—a predator that devoured all other egos and cultivated negativity. It was a clever existence who wouldn’t touch the empress’ soul which was an ego it couldn’t digest. It was only the royal lineage that could force it to bring out the empress’ soul.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It is a pity, but you have a duty to take on Pagma’s karma. Fall into hell instead of Pagma. Your death and resurrection will relieve my fellow kin’s grief.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">King Charles glanced at Pelot and Pelot explained it to Grid, “You will see a total of 10 rooms if you walk along the corridor of Pandemonium. Thousands of battle gear in every room will tempt you in various ways. Please ignore them and only look ahead. The presence at the end of the corridor will liberate the empress’ soul.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was easy. The problem was that it wasn’t something that people could easily do.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The basic passive of the dwarves was to ignore the words that entered their ears so they didn’t fall for the temptation of the battle gear. However, humans are easily swayed. Even the least greedy one wouldn’t be able to easily overcome all the temptations suggested by the thousands of egos.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I just pray that he’ll be caught by one that isn’t as vicious.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Pelot had a strong fondness for Grid and wanted to believe in him. He hoped that Grid would liberate the empress’ soul. Therefore, he gave Grid a chance, but honestly, he had no expectations of the outcome&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grid noticed Pelot’s saddened attitude and realized that Pandemonium was a place that couldn’t be underestimated. He took a deep breath. He bent down and entered Pandemonium as thousands of dwarves watched.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[The first discovery reward has increased mental resistance by 50% during the Pandemonium entry period.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[The ‘Item Weight Deletion Ticket (1 hour)’ has been acquired as the first discovery reward.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a weird compensation reward. It was very shabby compared to the usual initial compensation. However, Grid wasn’t shaken.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘There must be a reason for it.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was as expected.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: left"><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Did he walk for around 30 minutes? He didn’t know when he started feeling it, but heat washed over him. However, for the legendary blacksmith, Grid, this level of heat was just like a beginner’s sauna. Additionally...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">-Hey! You there! Don’t you want to know the island where the treasure of the Rams Pirates are buried?&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grid didn’t fall for the temptation of the ego items trapped in each room. The level of temptation presented by the ego items was too low for him. It was no wonder since Grid had wealth, power, and connections.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I don’t even need the mental resistance buff.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Honestly, he had been very nervous, but it didn’t seem to be anything big. Grid continued walking forward peacefully until he passed by the door of the 10th room. Here, he encountered a complication—one of the thousands of voices coming from the 10th room stopped Grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic"><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="775a3724">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>)*&amp;#<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f8d9b8">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a language that was completely incomprehensible, but it was somehow familiar.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘What does this mean?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grid focused his mind. He ignored the thousands of other miscellaneous voices and listened to the strange language. He remembered where he had heard this bizarre language.Grid’s eyes widened. The diary of someone who was alone. It reminded him of the Undefeated King’s Diary. That’s right—the language resembled that of Madra’s, who had spent hundreds of years alone and lost human speech.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘How can this be?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a time when Madra was forced to become a death knight and went crazy. Grid had interpreted the contents of Madra’s diary as a type of scream. Finally, he forgot human words and screamed from the pain that dominated his mind. Now he realized it was a language. The language of something other than human.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A rusty iron door—Grid was excited by the thought that the hint in the diary would no longer be undecipherable and tried to open the door. However, the locked iron door wouldn’t open. All types of ridicule was heard from the other egos.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">-This person is someone who can’t even open the door?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">-You see, didn’t I tell you that the dwarves have a big stride?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">-The one who came after so long is a useless guy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the midst of the constant ridicule, Grid pulled out a key. It was the Master Key.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">Clink!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old lock—the lock that seemed like it would never open because the keyhole was severely damaged—opened with a cheerful sound.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">-Ehhhhh! I believed in you!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">-Kiyaaaah! Grab me, human! I’ll give you the power to escape from here!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The battle gear locked up in the 10th room were rowdy with excitement. They eagerly welcomed the intruder’s visit. They treated the intruder as a host and were full of the expectation to escape from here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grid was still focusing his attention and it wasn’t long before he found the source of the language he heard—a pure white orb.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">-(%!#<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bf9bff">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>~!</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The closer he got, the clearer it became. The orb’s cry closely resembled that of the Undefeated King in his diary. This was the language. The confident Grid reached out and held the orb in his hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[’Orb Made from Galgunos’ Bones’ has been picked.]&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grid had passed all 10 rooms and, apart from this orb, there were no other items that attracted his interest. Grid took the Item Weight Deletion Ticket and used it without hesitation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I will take it to Sticks.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sticks was a great sage. He was blessed with knowledge and would be able to analyze and master the language through a conversation with this orb. Grid had no doubts and walked out of the 10th room with light steps. After a long walk, he finally reached the final place of Pandemonium.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He could see a cliff flowing with lava in front of him. Beneath the cliff was a tightly chained up helmet. It was a helmet that covered the entire face. It didn’t melt in the lava, but instead it was smiling with its mouthpiece.&nbsp;</span></p>
