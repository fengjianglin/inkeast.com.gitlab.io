 <p></p>
 <p><span style> [You have failed to observe the target’s skill.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>She tried a few more times but it was the same result.&nbsp;</span><span style>Euphemina became certain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A Saintess is a class that has at least a unique rating.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Based on what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel made a disbelieving expression, causing Euphemina to explain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A Duplicator has a clear limit as an epic class. It’s impossible for me to duplicate skills that have a higher rating than myself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In other words... You failed to duplicate Ruby’s skill?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. The only skills that I have failed to duplicate after raising my insight to a certain level belonged to Grid and Agnus... It is an experience I haven’t suffered in a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Agnus?”&nbsp;</span><span style>The 7th ranked Agnus was known to have an epic class.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was surprised by Euphemina’s words.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Agnus is an epic class, so isn’t he equivalent to you? So why did your Skill Observation fail?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He must have a growth type hidden class.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Like Hurent?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right. Growth type classes are considered to have a higher rating than epic classes, so I can’t duplicate his skills.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agnus was someone thoroughly wrapped in a veil of mystery. He never showed up in public. Traces of him could only be found in the rankings list or from NPCs.&nbsp;</span><span style>He changed his appearance every time, so there were rumors that he was an NPC instead of a user, or a game operator, or so on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Euphemina seemed to be familiar with Agnus, so this was an opportunity for Lauel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What exactly is Agnus’ class?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“At first I thought he was a necromancer type, but considering the various features, it is more appropriate to call him a lich.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lich? You mean an undead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lich were one of the strongest undead. They transcended the concept of life and death, and were known to have infinite magic power.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Agnus was a lich, it was reasonable to assume that he was stronger than Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"On the surface, he doesn’t seem to be an undead, but... It’s a bit difficult to explain. You’ll know if you meet him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel showed great interest.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Where should I go to meet him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you being very active? Are you perhaps thinking about trying to get Agnus as Grid’s subordinate? I would forget about it. Agnus is a very dangerous and abnormal figure. It isn’t possible to have a positive outcome when you get in touch with him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... I will listen to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agnus wasn’t the important thing right now. Grid’s sister had obtained a hidden class that at least had a unique rating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Did those siblings receive the blessing of the game gods?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The older brother was the first legendary class, while the younger sister received a hidden class at level 1.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was clear that Grid and his sister had saved a country in a previous life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Anyway, this is good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s power was grounded on the basis of being the best after Duplicator Euphemina and then Saintess Ruby joined.&nbsp;</span><span style>This would grow further if the Tzedakah Guild joined.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel envisioned a brilliant future, causing his mind to spin faster than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid and his sister are fighting well, but it isn’t good to drag this out.’&nbsp;</span><span style>A stamina system existed for users. Stamina would decrease the longer the battle lasted, so even Grid would face a crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>‘The golems are only concentrating on Grid. And the ancient weapons will probably explode every time they die. Then...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel shouted as he came up with a way to end this battle that lasted nearly 30 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid! Drive all the golems towards the ancient weapons!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The golems were endlessly coming towards him!&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was enjoying the battle due to Sehee’s strong support, and he saw the golems as chunks of experience. &nbsp;He turned his gaze towards Lauel and then frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t this too much? I have to deal with the ancient weapon at the same time. Do you want me to die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t understand Lauel’s intent. Unlike his sister, he was stupid, so it couldn’t be helped.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Dragon Claws.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel used an earth barrier to block the magic power heading towards Grid and shouted again.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Just do as I say! Focus on defeating the ancient weapon and run away immediately!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Satisfy, qi was a different concept of mana. For this reason, there was a separate class called the qigong master.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Anti-magic Shield wasn’t immune to skills of a qigong master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dragon’s Whispers!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The amount of damage the target will receive has increased by 30%.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kukukukung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The ancient weapon was affected by Lauel’s skill and started to twitch.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid confirmed this and reached out to Jude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Jude, let me borrow your sword for a bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll willingly do it.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Float.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid put the +8 Dainsleif in his inventory and used Fly. Sehee used Hope on him once again and Huroi cast a buff skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had full health. The strongest buff skill was nestled in his body.&nbsp;</span><span style>The best. An invincible feeling. There was nothing to fear in this world.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was just...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The kan jajang would’ve already become soggy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Won’t the food become tasteless?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was quite annoying, but he still felt good.&nbsp;</span><span style>His dear sister and companions.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now that they were enjoying Satisfy and relying on each other, Grid was truly happy.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had lived a lonely life without any friends, so this experience was truly precious to him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ssik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smiled with satisfaction and flew towards the ancient weapon that received the debuff from Lauel. He was like an eagle flying towards his prey.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kiyaaak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The old golems and soul dolls ignored the others, only chasing after Grid. Grid was annoyed by them, but recalled Lauel’s words and ignored them.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuoooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The ancient weapon remained silent as Grid approached, then launched its magic power.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was evidence that the golems were intelligent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Che!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid judged that it was too close to avoid and wore Doran’s Ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 23,900 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Healing effects will be reduced.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The options of Doran's Ring and the Holy Light Armor have been applied to restore 35,850 health.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Healing effect reduction?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>That hadn’t existed before.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid became convinced.&nbsp;</span><span style>The ancient weapons were steadily evolving during the battle. They were optimizing themselves to kill Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s great, but useless.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moon and stars were covered by a dark cloud of darkness.&nbsp;</span><span style>The ‘20% increase in damage in dark places’ effect was applied, making Failure more powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dazzling sword dance unfolded continuously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Link!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Transcend!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a storm of blue-white energy blades as the skills were connected.&nbsp;</span><span style>The power was lacking compared to Linked Kill and Transcended Link, so the ancient weapon wasn't destroyed immediately. However, it was enough to release the Anti-magic Shield.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gruruk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Then Grid swapped weapons. He used Dainsleif instead of Failure. Dainsleif gained additional attack power in proportion to the number of enemies, so it was just as good as Failure right now.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He used a skill straight after equipping it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Golden Flash!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A ray of gold crossed the night sky like the sun.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuaaaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The ancient weapon screamed as the ray penetrated through it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kiik!</span></i> <i><span style>Kiiik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The 800 golems following Grid were enraged. They watched the collapsing ancient weapon and howled like children losing their parents.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the midst of this turmoil, Euphemina yelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Exploit! Thunder Storm! Light Sword! Blizzard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a feast of A-grade magic.&nbsp;</span><span style>She didn’t go through the process of chanting the spell, so the powerful magic perfectly hit the ancient weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have destroyed an ancient weapon.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[3,342,000 experience has been distributed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Avoid it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel shouted the moment the notification window popped up, and Grid responded by disappearing at full speed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was a close call.&nbsp;</span><span style>Immediately after Grid escaped from the range of the explosion, a strong explosion occurred around the body of the ancient weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style>Most of the 800 golems following Grid were swept away by the explosion and turned to ashes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow... This was what you intended.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was full of admiration as he saw the result and recognized Lauel’s intentions. He got goosebumps.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Lauel, aren’t you really smart? The best.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel bowed gracefully towards Grid, who was looking at him with envy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are the one who is the best. I’m just your bridesmaid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘...My hands and feet are shrivelling.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was suffering from Lauel’s cheesy words when someone appeared in front of them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Euphemina had figured out the number of surviving golems.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are 43 old golems, 11 soul dolls and 9 ancient weapons remaining. This battle, let’s finish it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Good."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid handed Dainsleif back to Jude and gave a command.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The golems are only focused on me. You don’t have to protect Ruby and Sexy Schoolgirl anymore. Attack the ones after me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jude was better than Huroi and Lauel when it came to simple combat ability. He was an idiot who couldn’t be assigned important missions, but Jude was a very dependable person on the battlefield.&nbsp;</span><span style>Once his rampage started, the surviving old golems and soul dolls were overwhelmed. They were beaten and became mere pieces of stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Jude... I’ve never heard of him, but he must be a named NPC. To obtain NPCs as knights, at a minimum, an S-grade quest needs to be cleared and affinity built up... Grid is truly amazing. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the world was impressed by Jude, Grid was taking care of the remaining ancient weapons with Huroi, Lauel and Euphemina.&nbsp;</span><span style>The old golems and soul dolls were no longer obstructing them, so their speed at destroying the ancient golems was faster than before.</span></p>
