 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘This... perhaps?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, something passed through Grid’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Goddess' Essence!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Goddess' Essence was an unknown item dropped by Pope Drevigo.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had neglected it for over a year.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid pulled it out of his inventory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is unlikely that Drevigo would’ve dropped a useless item.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Drevigo wasn’t a typical boss.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was a person who had a big influence on Satisfy’s story.&nbsp;</span><span style>The man who ruined Satisfy’s first religion, the Rebecca Church.&nbsp;</span><span style>What was the probability that the liquid he dropped was simple water?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘None.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The name alone made it sound special.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid thought about it.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reason why he unsealed Lifael’s Spear. The cause of Pascal’s appearance. The cause of the elders sympathizing with Pascal’s cause...</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was all due to Drevigo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s highly likely that the item dropped by him is a solution to this.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was originally a game. The items that the final boss dropped were often clues to overcome despair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I shall check it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid decided and opened the lid of the small glass bottle. Then he placed one drop of it on Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tok.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The moment that Lifael’s Spear made of adamantium and the Goddess' Essence met.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Swaaaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A bright blue light emerged and filled the small room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah!”&nbsp;</span><span style>Isabel exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid gazed at the beautiful light before turning to her.&nbsp;</span><span style>A notification window popped up in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The information about the Goddess' Essence has been updated.]</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Five days had passed with no news from Crow.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kamiyan was forced to admit it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Crow has died.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first, Kamiyan was dubious.&nbsp;</span><span style>Crow's assassination skills were the best.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was difficult to imagine that he failed in his assassination.&nbsp;</span><span style>But on the fifth day, it was obvious that Crow had failed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Stupid, you spoke such confident words.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyway, things had become clear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid’s strength is on the same level as me. There is no doubt.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to be careful.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid hadn’t announced that there was an assassination attempt. It was like he had never received the assassination threat.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a clear sign of his willingness to remain calm until he figured out who was behind it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I thought he was ridiculous when he treated Pascal and the elders in that way, but he’s actually a fox.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A tricky bastard.&nbsp;</span><span style>To be praised by members of the church while having individual power...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Pascal’s gift attempts are failing every day. It isn’t good to drag this out longer.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan shifted his gaze out the window.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian and Huroi were still campaigning today.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were a nuisance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Especially that person called Huroi...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>His speaking ability wasn’t common. He quickly took control of the hearts of the church members. Some of the senior priests bought by Pascal now seemed to favor Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Huroi called dog feces a drug, they would believe it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will deal with it personally.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In one week.&nbsp;</span><span style>The event that took place exactly 30 days before the pope election.&nbsp;</span><span style>The pope candidates would give speeches to the priests of the Rebecca Church scattered across the continent, as well as the nobles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that time, Earl Chirita of the Saharan Empire was going to attend.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal's father was different from Pascal. He got rid of any risks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to receive his support to hit Grid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He acknowledged that Grid’s individual power was superior. However, Grid’s total power wasn’t good.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a Rebecca’s Daughter who might die today, Damian, and the orator Huroi.&nbsp;</span><span style>It would be easy to take care of him if Kamiyan joined forces with Earl Chirita.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[Goddess' Essence]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A liquid that contains the divine power of Goddess Rebecca. It is simple liquid to the general public, but it is a poison to those who possess black magic power and a miracle drug to those who serve the goddess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When mixed with minerals, it will maximize the viscosity of the minerals and improve the mineral’s unique functions. In addition, it will inject divine power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 0.1</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Maximizing the viscosity? Does it mean like clay? This would make it easier to shape the item.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The secret of the spear combination was hidden here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your understanding of Lifael’s Spear will increase by 40%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have discovered the hidden secret of the item! A great achievement!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Insight has increased by 30.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Intelligence has increased by 30.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Appraisal skill has improved. When you observe an item, the understanding of it will increase.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow. Amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was delighted.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was pleased that he had uncovered the purpose of the Goddess' Essence and the secret behind how the spear was joined. Now he also received bonuses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Even more.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid turned to stare at Isabel. Her complexion had noticeably improved.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the healing effect caused by the ripple that occurred when the Goddess’ Essence touched Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘First, save Isabel.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was imperative.&nbsp;</span><span style>Isabel needed to be healthy to be separated from Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Then I can proceed with the disassembly and assembly process.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mission was clear.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid rose from his spot. He handed the Goddess' Essence to Isabel, who admired it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Drink."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel refused,&nbsp;</span><span style>“I-I don’t want to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t receive such a precious thing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you at the crossroad of life and death? Just drink.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don't want to."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why won’t you drink it? Just drink a drop.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was 1 ml of Goddess' Essence.&nbsp;</span><span style>The volume of one drop of water was 1/20ml, so it meant there were 20 drops.&nbsp;</span><span style>Isabel’s health improved because of just one drop resonating with Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style>Isabel could be healed if she drank one drop directly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was confident.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Isabel was stubborn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I appreciate the courtesy, but I don’t want to be beholden to you anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, isn’t it just one drop?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don't want to."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The last five days.&nbsp;</span><span style>Isabel had many conversations with Grid while they were alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the process, she discovered something.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was already married.&nbsp;</span><span style>She couldn’t look at Grid in this way anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style>Isabel suppressed her feelings for Grid. In order to do so, she needed to draw a line. She didn’t want to receive Grid’s kindness anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid shrugged as she bowed her head.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Isabel, aren’t you misunderstanding me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The reason I helped you is because it benefits me. It isn’t unconditional goodness. So don’t be mistaken and drink it right now. I'm busy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel was too embarrassed to refuse after Grid’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel accepted the small glass bottle from Grid. Then she hesitantly raised it to her mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was concerned that she would accidentally drink several drops.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘She has become very timid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, Isabel was a very willful girl.&nbsp;</span><span style>But she suffered thanks to Drevigo and Pascal.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was a tool, not a human, and was going to die... She had listened to those words for a while and couldn’t help changing.&nbsp;</span><span style>She truly was a poor kid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid sighed and took the bottle from her. He placed a drop of liquid on his finger and raised it to Isabel’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lick."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Eh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel’s face reddened.&nbsp;</span><span style>A man. Furthermore, the man wanted her to lick his finger. Her mind became complicated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah really, do I have to feed it to you directly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid shoved his finger into Isabel’s lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Combined with the title effects, Grid’s dexterity was over 2,300.&nbsp;</span><span style>Isabel shivered as Grid’s finger entered his mouth. The sensations that she felt for the first time stirred her body and made her dizzy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thick and solid finger touched Isabel’s uvula...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Omitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah... Hah...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The drained Isabel collapsed on her bed.&nbsp;</span><span style>A warm blue light wrapped around her body.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Goddess' Essence was immediately effective.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her platinum hair started to shine beautifully again, while her rough skin became transparent and smooth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really pretty. Now if you can just recover your old figure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel’s faced turned redder at Grid’s compliment.&nbsp;</span><span style>She covered her face with both hands and gasped for breath, while Grid wondered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Her status is odd.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her health is recovering. But why did she look more tired?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dok.</span></i> <i><span style>Dok dok.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As Grid was feeling puzzled, a homing pigeon tapped on the window.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a homing pigeon sent by Irene.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid received the letter before taking Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You said there was a smithy here? I will go to the smithy, so you rest here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel’s eyes were wet as she peeked at Grid through the gap in her fingers. It seemed like she was eager for something.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her eyes were enough to remind him of Irene in bed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gulp.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid involuntarily swallowed his dry saliva. It was to shake off his raunchy imagination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It seems that the process of restoring her health is quite pleasant.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid thought and left the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nyang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe was sunbathing on the windowsill in the corridor.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid looked at the cat rolling around on his plump stomach like he was pathetic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Tsk tsk, I gave him a job, but he’s just sleeping.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wasn’t aware that an assassin had come after him five days ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a pity for Noe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[White Transformation is activated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You don’t have any divine power. White Transformation has failed to be activated. Side effects will occur to your body.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The notification windows kept popping up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before heading to the smithy, Grid stopped in the garden and put down Lifael’s Spear. Then he sat on a bench and opened the letter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[I can feel the movements of the child in my belly. Every day is mysterious and fun. I want to share this happiness with you soon. Dear Husband, what do you want your child to be interested in when they grow up?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Answer your wife’s question. This will affect the child’s abilities after they are born.]</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <ol>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style> I want the child to be interested in martial arts.</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style> I want the child to be interested in magic.</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style> I want the child to be interested in learning.</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style> I want the child to be interested in theology.</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style> I want the child to be interested in techniques.</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style> I just want the child to be healthy.</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ol>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don’t like number four.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had a negative opinion of religion thanks to Drevigo and Pascal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don’t want number six either. The child might turn out like Jude.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Among the remaining options, the most attractive one was...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Techniques.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid thought that his child would become the estate’s labor force when they were older, and started to write his reply.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wrote that he loved Irene and then gave his answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will go to her once I finish my work here.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid finished the letter and tied it to the leg of the homing pigeon.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaduduk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The homing pigeon flew towards the south west. It was the direction of Winston.&nbsp;</span><span style>As Grid was looking after the pigeon, someone approached.</span></p>
