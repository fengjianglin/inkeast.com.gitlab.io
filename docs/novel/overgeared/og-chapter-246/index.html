 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘Are we going to die like this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The assassins were trained to maintain their composure under any circumstances.&nbsp;</span><span style>Surveillance, assault, assassination, etc.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their tasks required secrecy and patience, so suppressing their emotions was the most basic skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now the Black Arrow assassins lost their composure. In other words, they were clearly terrified.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was evidence that their status was low.&nbsp;</span><span style>An excellent assassin would’ve kept their composure, no matter how strong their target.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Your master is a dog and you’re just at the level of a gangster.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Step, step.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The target moved closer and approached them.&nbsp;</span><span style>The assassins were good at using a dagger, so they welcomed close combat, but this situation was an exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There is no chance when facing him from the front.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their colleagues were killed in the blink of an eye.&nbsp;</span><span style>The six assassins quickly determined and spread out. Then they threw their daggers.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pa pa pa pat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dozens of daggers flooded towards Grid. It seemed like there was no room to evade.&nbsp;</span><span style>The assassins naturally thought that Grid would bleed.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had an extremely poor imagination.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A jade greatsword was calmly and quickly pulled out. Then dozens of daggers flying at Grid were sucked into the centre of a vortex.&nbsp;</span><span style>This wasn’t the end. Then the direction of the vortex changed and the daggers popped out like bullets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Revolve.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk!</span></i> <i><span style>Puuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Keook!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kkuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The effect of ‘skill damage increased by 20%’ made the daggers bombardment much more powerful than when the assassins threw them.&nbsp;</span><span style>The assassins hit by the daggers became a hedgehog.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Being hit by my own attack!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was serious.&nbsp;</span><span style>The eyes of the assassins swayed like a lamp in front of the wind.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid triggered Blacksmith’s Rage and wielded the blue greatsword like a lightning bolt.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Two colleagues lost their lives at once.&nbsp;</span><span style>The bodies and heads were separated, turning them to ash at once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He is too strong...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The assassins were well aware of the fact that the Slaughterer was strong.&nbsp;</span><span style>But they were confident that they could kill the Slaughterer if all nine assassins did a pincer attack.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the number of people who could access the basement was limited to three.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It meant that the target was a monster who had taken on the Slaughterer alone. However, the nine of them could beat the target if they fought together.&nbsp;</span><span style>But that wasn’t it.&nbsp;</span><span style>The target’s strength far exceeded the assumed range.&nbsp;</span><span style>He might even be a match for the famous&nbsp; Red Knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Black Arrows that followed Earl Zebra and committed many bad acts were wiped out on this day.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I aim at a vital spot, the chances of activating the Bisect skill is much higher... Is it? I need to experiment a bit more.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid defeated the Slaughterer and gained a lot of experience.&nbsp;</span><span style>He defeated nine Black Arrows assassins with an average level of 240, and his level rose due to the additional experience.&nbsp;</span><span style>288.&nbsp;</span><span style>Based on his level, he was now within the top 500 rankings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But that strength?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>His rank had nothing to do with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘My agility is too low.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid invested all 10 stat points into agility, but he still felt that it was lacking.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro’s strength and agility was a 1:1 ratio. Grid had used him for reference and invested all points into agility for several months, but his ratio was still a mess.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had invested most of his stat points into strength until he met Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid currently had 2,810 strength and 1,606 agility.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had to make the ratio of these two stats 1:1. If he wanted to use the ideal swordsmanship that balanced strength and speed, he needed to gain at least another 120 levels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘My vision is dark.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But did he feel desperate?&nbsp;</span><span style>No way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to concentrate on hunting every time I take a break.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, Grid didn’t care about overworking himself.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would be rewarded for all the effort he put in.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was well aware of this fact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe flew to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>"Praise the best demonic beast of hell! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Based on his expression, he had completed his task properly.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the end of Earl Zebra’s reign.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s go to Titan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now Grid didn’t need the hat.&nbsp;</span><span style>The mask and eyepatch hid his features, so his ID was automatically hidden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid moved forward without hesitation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He met monsters on the way to Titan and gradually adjusted to dual wielding and using the Vital Spot Detection skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>After the battle, he recreated the contents and sought how to overcome his weaknesses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The journey to Tital would take approximately a fortnight.&nbsp;</span><span style>Until then, Grid’s goal was to reach at least level 291.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Randy and Noe became surprisingly friendly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Noe! Cute!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kyang! Pat the best demonic beast of hell on the head! Stroke my chin as well! Kyang!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The 31st knight, Idan.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the youngest of the Red Knights.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was only 14 years old when he joined the knights and now he was 23 years old. He wasn’t from a prestigious family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But nobody could ignore him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who would make fun of him, one of the empire’s strongest knights?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hrmm~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scene where Earl Zebra was murdered.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were dozens of nobles and knights present.&nbsp;</span><span style>They stood like stone statues and watched Idan.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Idan didn’t look at them.&nbsp;</span><span style>He questioned the seven soldiers who murdered Earl Zebra, as well as the circumstances around his murder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Um~ I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Idan made an expression like he finally grasped the situation. Then at the place where Earl Zebra was killed. In other words, he sat on the throne in the great hall.&nbsp;</span><span style>Nobody pointed out that this behavior was unbecoming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Idan ordered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Destroy them and their families.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“S-Sir Idan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The seven soldiers who murdered Earl Zebra cried out.&nbsp;</span><span style>Didn’t he say that their families would live if they cooperated with the investigation?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a ruthless command!&nbsp;</span><span style>Idan smiled at those who were looking at him with eyes full of pleading and resentment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I understand the reason why you needed to kill Earl Zebra. In addition, I know that Earl Zebra deserved to die. But a crime is a crime. I need to enforce the law.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you doing this? You promised to spare our families!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That was if you cooperated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We willingly cooperated!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes~? When?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldiers realized it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Idan was an evil person. He was just as vicious as Earl Zebra. It was chilling to see him laugh as he sentenced dozens of people to death.&nbsp;</span><span style>Idan watched the soldiers who were dragged to the execution area before turning to the nobles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you say you were Baron Veradin?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Veradin was called by Idan and took one step forward.&nbsp;</span><span style>Idan observed him closely before smiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You accidentally witnessed the murder of Earl Zebra at the hands of his soldiers and arrested them... Aren’t you wonderful?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was blatantly sarcastic. The situation was excellent enough to make Veradin stand out, and Idan clearly smelt it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Veradin didn’t shake.&nbsp;</span><span style>He bowed while maintaining a calm expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I might’ve been able to save Earl Zebra if I arrived at the scene a little sooner. I am sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Idan’s eyes darkened. Veradin was a pretty tough guy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you know anything about the killer of the Slaughterer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just before Earl Zebra was murdered, someone had killed the Slaughterer by himself.&nbsp;</span><span style>Idan suspected that these things were related.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, it was a problem because Veradin, who was presumed to be in the center of the case, remained consistent until the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is all the soldiers said. He was alone, and was a black-haired man full of grace. I didn’t see him myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, I understand."</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was the end.&nbsp;</span><span style>Idan left without looking at Earl Zebra’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he looked at direction where the killer of the Slaughterer had headed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is he?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The empire’s judgment division determined that the Slaughterer was an A+ grade monster.&nbsp;</span><span style>Three black knights weren’t able to defeat it, so he was sent alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t like the fact that he was pushed to do this troublesome thing. Now he was irritated because the situation had become more complicated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A person who can handle an A+ grade monster alone isn’t ordinary... The seniors won’t like it if I return without investigating the person’s identity.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could only sigh.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this authentic information?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, now is the perfect time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zibal was second on the unified rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Snake Guild, led by him, was growing rapidly, but he couldn’t help feeling anxiety.&nbsp;</span><span style>The total number of guild members was 275 and their average level exceeded 230.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>At least 100 of them were in the top 1,000 rankers.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had recently achieved his goal of becoming an earl of the Haken Kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would be the first user to become a king.&nbsp;</span><span style>But there was a big stumbling block.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was none other than Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had become a duke at once due to the large-scale golem invasion.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was highly likely that Grid would take the title of first king.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Zibal couldn’t sit back, and instead made a plan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seven guilds had joined forces to keep Grid and Reidan in check.&nbsp;</span><span style>The leaders of the seven guilds pledged to cooperate. They would suppress Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>But there was a problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid and the Overgeared Guild were too big.&nbsp;</span><span style>How could they invade Reidan when there was a group of monsters completely dominating the 10th to 40th places in the unified rankings?&nbsp;</span><span style>If the seven guilds combined, it might be possible to kill the Overgeared members, but they would have to take huge damage. It would turn into a loss for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zibal and the leaders of the seven guilds couldn’t carelessly take action. They were worried for the past few months, but had to wait.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then a chance arrived.&nbsp;</span><span style>According to a scouting team dispatched to the western part of the Eternal KIngdom, Grid had recently disappeared and the Overgeared members had left Reidan to develop a mine.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Reidan was completely vacant.&nbsp;</span><span style>What if they invaded and destroyed the facilities?&nbsp;</span><span style>It would be a huge blow that Grid would find difficult to overcome.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Head to Reidan right now. Put on a helmet or mask to hide your identity and move as secretly and quickly as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is Grid’s city...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sight of the endless fields and walls made Damian overwhelmed.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had travelled to many big cities during his adventures, but in terms of size, Reidan was the best.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Being a duke is really great! Ruling this great city! Amazing! The population must be at least over 100,000!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian looked around at the surroundings and admired it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Were visitors unwelcome?&nbsp;</span><span style>Two farmers suddenly arrived in front of him and asked him a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who are you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
