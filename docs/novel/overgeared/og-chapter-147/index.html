 <p></p>
 <p><span style> ‘I did it!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was successful and felt greater joy than ever.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the legendary items he had made so far.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Sword of Self-transcendence, Divine Shield, and Thorn of Deep Grievance were clearly excellent, but not enough to be called the best.&nbsp;</span><span style>They weren’t a match for the unique rated Dainsleif made by Albatino.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Failure was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>The item was directly created by Grid and was an undeniably superior weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dainsleif? It was enough to throw Dainsleif to the dogs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s different.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was convinced.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Now I am the best.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had the strongest armor set and now he was holding the strongest weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style>Wasn’t he invincible?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Oh my god... Who would’ve imagined the day would come when a talent-less gamer like me would be like this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was new.&nbsp;</span><span style>Before becoming Pagma’s Descendant, he had played hard for a year and only reached level 80.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the end...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Grip.</span></i><span style> Grid formed two fists!&nbsp;</span><span style>All of the emotions he had suppressed started to emerge as he shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m a winner!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Top rankers? Game geniuses?&nbsp;</span><span style>They were all destined to be helpless in front of the power of items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahahahat! Aren’t I raising my level too quickly? The system isn’t as good as items. Pu~hahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If they found out why Grid was laughing, the rankers who were hunting would become angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blood Witch Yura? Our next encounter will be different! Now I am better than her? Puhahat! Kek! Kek! Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was laughing like crazy when he confirmed the notification windows in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have proven your potential by making five legendary items.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The explanation of the Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship said that something special would occur when five legendary rated items were made.&nbsp;</span><span style>The notification windows in front of Grid kept updating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have grown enough. You are no longer a nameless blacksmith.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[All future items you make will be engraved with your initial ‘G.’]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[It will become known all over the world that Pagma’s Descendant has been born.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your potential is blooming.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The penalty that occurs when an item’s usage conditions isn’t met is reduced by 15% per rating.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The penalty of an item’s options being reduced by 50% when an item’s usage conditions isn’t met will disappear.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The speed of item understanding will become two times faster.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was good thus far.&nbsp;</span><span style>The fact that the penalties when wearing items that he didn’t meet the usage conditions were reduced was tremendous.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid felt like he would have a heart attack from the joy.&nbsp;</span><span style>But...</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your growth has deteriorated due to the blossoming of your potential.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The amount of stats acquired when making items will drop.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You won’t acquire any additional stats in the future when making items with a rare rating.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You won’t acquire any additional stats in the future when making items with an epic rating.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[When unique rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +4.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[When legendary rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +10.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>So far, Grid was awarded +2 to all stats when making a rare rated item, +4 to all stats for an epic item, +12 to all stats for a unique item and +25 to all stats when making a legendary item.&nbsp;</span><span style>But what was this?&nbsp;</span><span style>His potential blossoming(he read it as depleted), caused the amount of additional stats obtained from making items to drop significantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dammit...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It caused damage in the long-term.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t just damage, but huge damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhhhhhh! These damn operators!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why were they making the boundaries of a legendary class so blatant?&nbsp;</span><span style>This was a balance patch for Grid, but he couldn’t help screaming.&nbsp;</span><span style>Meanwhile, the notification windows were being renewed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The class of Pagma’s Descendant will be revealed to the world. Do you want to register for the rankings and announce that you are Pagma’s Descendant?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was the Grid in the past, he would’ve said YES because he wanted to be a celebrity.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now it was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The famous people in the Tzedakah Guild, including Jishuka, suffered from huge crowds wherever they went. Grid witnessed it several times and now he had no desire to be a celebrity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In the first place, it’s more profitable to make money from items than from the broadcasting fees.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You won’t be registered in the rankings.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The information for the Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship skill has been updated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[(Witness of God’s Weapon) Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lv.3 (87.1%)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Produce equipment items that you know how to make.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You can create the production methods for a new item with the ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You can produce myth rated items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There is a high probability of producing rare~ epic rated items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There is a certain probability of creating unique rated items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There is a rare probability of creating legendary rated items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There is a very rare probability of making myth grade items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* All stats of a production items will increase by 17%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* When unique rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +4 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +150.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* When legendary rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +10 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +500.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* When myth rated items are produced, your reputation throughout the continent will rise by +1,000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Something special will occur with every five legendary items created. (Currently 5/10)</span></p>
 <p><span style>"... This is real. It really isn’t a joke...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The skill description was miserable compared to before.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid noted that special effects would occur every time he made five legendary items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Legendary items? I won’t make them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The special events seemed to be a balance patch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In fact, it isn’t quite rotten.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were advantages, such as the reduced item penalties. The next special effect might be even better.&nbsp;</span><span style>As he was trying to think positively, the final notification windows appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You currently have 11,830 reputation throughout the continent. You can use the Reputation Store when your reputation reaches over 30,000.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Reputation Store]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A special store for all users. It is possible to purchase goods with reputation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>There are many rare items, so please be sure to use it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The store’s location will periodically change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The system notified him of the existence of the reputation store only after the reputation that could be obtained from making an item dropped?&nbsp;</span><span style>Wasn’t this deliberately making fun of people?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s face turned red,&nbsp;</span><span style>“These operators @$&amp;*(!~$#@#<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="cfeeeeb18f">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>*!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>After making the strongest item.&nbsp;</span><span style>Khan watched Grid as he ran amok in joy and then anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It has been a while since I’ve seen this...'</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>S.A. Group’s headquarters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yoon Nahee and her team members were watching the monitor.&nbsp;</span><span style>They watched the moment when Grid made the legendary rated Failure.&nbsp;</span><span style>The team members let out sounds of admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, amazing. A legendary rated item popped up straight away?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He normally makes normal and rare items, so isn’t his luck good these days? He’s a late bloomer. Kilkil.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yoon Sangmin spoke from a corner.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Now that he has obtained the strongest legendary weapon, the balance will collapse rapidly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Team Leader Yoon Nahee shook her head.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Rather , the balance will be adjusted.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The monitor changed to Grid’s viewpoint. They were able to see the list of notification windows that were being updated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He now acquires less stats and reputation when making an item. Well, isn’t this too delayed?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Yoon Sangmin sneered at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The team members wondered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t you know? Satisfy’s system has already been established. Unless a new episode or event-driven quest is added, there is no need to add a patch to the existing system.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what is this? Is this skill change scheduled?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yoon Nahee nodded,&nbsp;</span><span style>"That's right. Pagma’s Descendant isn’t a pure combat class. Its combat ability is lower than other legendary classes, but it can’t grow infinitely by enjoying the stat boost effect. Well... Based on the current situation, I don’t think that his combat ability will be pushed in comparison to the other legendary classes...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The problem was that Grid was an unlucky person.&nbsp;</span><span style>According to supercomputer Morpheus’ predictions, Pagma’s Descendant should’ve made five legendary items three months ago and not gained as many stats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Grid was so unlucky that he couldn’t make legendary items. No matter how hard he tried, he only made low rated items.&nbsp;</span><span style>Therefore, Grid had a much longer stats-synergistic effect than Morpheus predicted, turning bad luck into good luck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know if he is lucky or unlucky...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>By this time, the whole word started to shake.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the aftermath of the shocking message that appeared to all users who connected to Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A successor to Pagma’s techniques and will has emerged. He is the only legend in the world who can produce legendary items.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Breaking news, breaking news, breaking news!&nbsp;</span><span style>A feast of breaking news.&nbsp;</span><span style>The media in each country made a fuss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Who is Pagma?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Pagma, a legendary blacksmith and master of the sword!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Is Pagma’s Descendant a legendary class?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[It is estimated to be a legendary thanks to the phrase ‘legendary.’]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The only legendary item maker!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The first legendary class out of two billion users has appeared!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[(Column) What is the power of a legendary class?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The 1st ranked blacksmith Panmir, ‘I am not Pagma’s Descendant.’]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The top guilds are already in action to find Pagma’s Descendant...]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Is Pagma’s Descendant the creator of the Special Jaffa Arrow?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The possessor of the third epic class, Katz. ‘Pagma’s Descendant? The legendary class is just a blacksmith. It’s nothing in front of the Blood Warrior. I’ll give him enough money to become my personal blacksmith.’ Katz’ arrogant remark!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at the level of panic.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reaction was different compared to when the epic classes were announced.&nbsp;</span><span style>The S.A. Group judged that the atmosphere was being overheated from one topic and took action.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Immediately activate the quests for the national competition in the game. It will disperse people’s attention."&nbsp;</span><span style>Lim Cheolho commanded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a new notification window appeared in front of all users in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[In two months of real time, a national competition will be held in honor of each country. Participants will be recruited. Prove your abilities by completing in-game quests.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gaze of the media started to shift.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Various event quests have been created in the game. There are special rewards just for participating in the quests?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The S.A. Group’s national competition will be hosted in South Korea!]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The national competition will include events like a boss raid, PvP, pet marathon, breaking through a labyrinth, various production games, siege, etc...]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Chairman Lim Cheolho. ‘If you are selected as a national representative, there will be tremendous rewards.’]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[(Column) The first legendary class, Pagma’s Descendant. Will he also participate in the national competition?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[What country is Pagma’s Descendant from?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The country that Pagma’s Descendant belongs to will be the national champion.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, the attention of the press and public opinion once again focused on Pagma’s Descendant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>At Khan’s smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was doing his own work, regardless of the world’s interest.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was due to Jishuka’s request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It is highly likely that there will be a war with the Yatan Church. We need your skills. I hope that you can produce items for all guild members within a month.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One month? Hey, then I won’t have time to participate in the event quests.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Omo? Do you plan to compete in the national competition? Can you cope with the storm that will happen once your identity is revealed? Pag.ma’s De.scend.ant?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...It is too annoying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The most desperate person was Vantner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid! My armor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have learned how to make the Wave Armor.]</span></p>
