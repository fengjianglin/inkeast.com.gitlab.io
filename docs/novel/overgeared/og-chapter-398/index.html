 <p><span style>Chapter 398</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘Well, I can understand Huroi to some extent.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The combat skills of the orator class were the worst, so his past ordeals were likely to have a low degree of difficulty.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t difficult for Huroi to overcome the trial, since he had grown after acquiring his second class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But Yura and Jishuka are different.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were both geniuses.&nbsp;</span><span style>The difficulty of their past trials would be beyond imagination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>So how did they get past the 31st island?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Did they never have hard times because they were so good in the first place? If so, it’s great enough to be compared to this body.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Lauel was taking these ridiculous thoughts seriously, the other Overgeared members were comparing the items they purchased on Fog Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I bought five agility elixirs and one rare skill book.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huhuhu, I bought 13 stamina elixirs. I’m becoming increasingly qualified to be called a tanker.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wow, Faker and Vantner hit the jackpot.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m envious... I found Fog Island too quickly and only bought four elixirs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I reached the 31st Island and didn’t see Fog Island at all. It’s irritating.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me too...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The system of the Fog Island in the Behen Archipelago purely depended on luck.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t easy to use the island because it appeared too soon or too late.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m worried about Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The world thought that Grid was an extremely lucky person.&nbsp;</span><span style>Wasn’t Grid the first legendary class?&nbsp;</span><span style>People appreciated Grid’s luck and assumed he was a person who saved a country in his previous life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the Overgeared members knew the truth.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was never lucky. The question was whether he had been abandoned by Lady Luck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A legendary blacksmith who has bad luck and can’t make legendary items...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if he completely clears the Behen Archipelago, what if Fog Island never appears again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members were genuinely concerned, while Lauel’s heart ached.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Even if you have bad luck as usual, keep up your mental strength, My Lord.’</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The Behen Archipelago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid frowned after entering the 56th island.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were two caves in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why two instead of one?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did he have to attack both?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The scale isn’t a joke.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the 55th island, level 400 monsters started to pop up.&nbsp;</span><span style>If there were many monsters in the huge caves in front of him, Grid wouldn’t dare to challenge it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It will take a long time to deal with those in the cave due to the level difference...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he continued further into the Behen Archipelago, the difficulty increased exponentially.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s confidence was declining when a notification window appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A mission will be created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[56th Island]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Break through the labyrinth!</span></p>
 <p><span style>First Clear Reward: 2,150 challenger points. Access to Treasure Island for 3 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Treasure Island!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid, whose shoulders were slumped, instantly brightened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Treasure Island, the name is fantastic!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A place where legendary achievements were celebrated, the Behen Archipelago.&nbsp;</span><span style>In some ways, it was the most sacred place on the whole continent.&nbsp;</span><span style>A hidden Treasure Island, wouldn’t tremendous treasures be buried there?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It will be great if I can obtain adamantium.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Holy Light Set that he used since the Pope Drevigo raid was made of the god mineral adamantium.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was convinced that he could make huge items if he had adamantium.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay... I will challenge it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid regained his motivation and neared the entrance of the two caves.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the same time, Grid’s body stiffened like a stone statue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Eh? I can’t move?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was different from a status condition.&nbsp;</span><span style>His hands were stiff and couldn’t move as a choice entered his view.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Do you want to go to the left cave or the right cave?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Ah...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the moment he entered his island, the labyrinth had already begun.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wasn’t able to move in a direction other than the two options.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There are no variables.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid turned his gaze to the rear.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to ask Sticks, ‘What should I do to clear the labyrinth?’ But he couldn’t speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It isn’t just my movements, but my mouth as well...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed to be the same for Sticks.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was standing as stiffly as Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is confusing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had no experience with labyrinths.&nbsp;</span><span style>The complex structure and traps made the difficulty of clearing labyrinths so high that he never challenged it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, Grid didn’t have the knowledge to break through labyrinths.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was dark in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In the end, I have to gamble.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid thought about it for a while before taking one step forward.&nbsp;</span><span style>The direction he chose was the right cave.&nbsp;</span><span style>The result.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is crazy!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as Grid entered the right cave, he automatically screamed.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was natural.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were six paths in front of him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I won’t be able to pass it like this.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was able to get a sense of how much time it would take to pass through this massive labyrinth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Maybe I won’t be able to pass it before the National Competition begins...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the worst. He was desperate.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid had a trump card.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Assimilation.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sururuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s hair became white and his eyes shone like rubies.&nbsp;</span><span style>Did he borrow the wisdom of a sage?&nbsp;</span><span style>No, he borrowed the wisdom of someone much higher than that.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was gradually becoming more versatile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoh, you thought about using this method to take advantage of my wisdom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham used Magic Detection (Enhanced) and walked towards the path with the most powerful and malicious aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham handled the hidden monster and appeared in front of a new crossroads. Then he taught Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The labyrinth has a habit of not wanting to miss anyone who steps in it. The closer you are to the exit, the more danger there will be. Use Magic Detection to move slowly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The duration of Assimilation was 3 minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Braham gave Grid great advice and then fell asleep.&nbsp;</span><span style>A smile appeared on Grid’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Thank you, Braham.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to him, Grid got a hint about how to break through the labyrinth and learned new magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Magic Detection (Enhanced) Lv. 1]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A magic detection developed by the legendary great magician who has completely overturned the activation formula.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Emits a large amount of mana in all directions, locating all living things in a radius of 10 meters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The higher the magic level, the wider the detection range and the more information that can be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Resource Consumption: 3,000 Mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Casting Time: 6 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: 10 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I move using Braham’s advice...’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Paaaat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Grid stood in front of eight paths and used Magic Detection that he had learned from Braham.&nbsp;</span><span style>Mana stretched out in all directions around Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I found it!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The strongest aura was felt from the end of one of the eight paths.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was sure that there was a monster there. He summoned the God Hands, Randy, and Noe and entered the battle with his full power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok... Heok...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The monster that appeared in the labyrinth had a level between 400~410.&nbsp;</span><span style>The level difference between the level 306 Grid and the monsters was so great that he didn’t do much damage, while Grid suffered from tremendous damage whenever he received a hit.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was like a boss raid every time Grid encountered a monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The problem isn’t the monsters.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reuse time of Magic Detection was 10 minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was reduced to 8 minutes if he wore Braham’s Boots, which reduced cooldown time.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a result, Grid could only move every 8 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How long will it take to break through this labyrinth?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>His eyes were dark. He was mentally very tired.&nbsp;</span><span style>But.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will continue.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Labor was a familiar area for Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s grim mentality started to shine.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The master of the Yak Guild, part of the seven guilds, was Bubat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was 53rd on the unified rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style>It couldn’t be compared to his 25th rank in the past, but nobody said that he was worse than before.&nbsp;</span><span style>He combined bold judgments and powerful CCs to be called Satisfy’s best initiator.&nbsp;</span><span style>The battlefield was always favorable to his allies when Bubat was fighting in the lead. His nickname was ‘Yak who Promises Victory.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But at the time of the last National Competition, Bubat was helpless. He didn’t live up to his reputation and disappointed people.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was it because he was in a bad condition?&nbsp;</span><span style>No.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because he met Yura and Grid in succession.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the case of Yura, his CC was destroyed by her excellent physical abilities. Grid was too bad because he resisted all CCs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bubat was frustrated because it couldn’t be helped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I won’t be the one feeling frustrated in this National Competition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After reaching level 300, Bubat obtained many hitting skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unlike the past where he relied exclusively on CC, he now had appropriate attack skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>Besides, Bubat was fundamentally a tanker!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The biggest beneficiary of the patch is me! Huhuhut!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s legendary skills?&nbsp;</span><span style>50% reduction in damage meant that Bubat could endure several blows.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would make it became a long battle and eventually break Grid with his high stamina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will repay the shame of the past while gaining a gold medal for my country, Turkey!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Waaaaaaaah!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people of Turkey cheered at Bubat’s declaration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t just Bubat. All the participants from all over the world were confident that they could handle Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>One patch made a person into a pushover.</span></p>
