 <p><span style>[Blacksmith’s Rage]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Difficulty: B</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Pagma’s descendant, you have inherited Pagma’s will as well as his techniques. You have Pagma’s humanitarian ideology of using ‘blacksmithing to benefit other people.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>You can never forgive the Mero Company and its minions, who oppress the old and powerless blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Help the blacksmith Khan, who had fallen for the tricks of the Mero Company and lost his customers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Conditions: Get rid of the Mero Company’s minions and destroy the smithy transfer contract.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clear Reward: Blacksmith Khan’s alcoholic symptoms will improve. Affinity with Khan will reach the maximum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Khan was originally an excellent blacksmith. But after his business was ruined due to the tricks of the Mero Company and he was subjected to severe stress, an alcohol dependency was created. He is currently an incompetent old man, but if he improves from his alcoholism, he will surely regain his status as a great blacksmith. At that time, he will figure out your identity and help you greatly...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Acceptance Reward: The skill ‘Blacksmith’s Rage’ is created.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Failure: A few days later, Khan will die and all quests related to him will be permanently destroyed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blacksmith’s ideology?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is this a parody of humanitarianism?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The motto of the legendary blacksmith Pagma!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Is there a &nbsp;hidden class that will appear after eating only garlic for 100 days?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, now wasn’t the time to joke around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This situation is a quest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as I expected.&nbsp;</span><span style>A ruined smithy and blacksmith. The sudden appearance of gangsters was the precursor to the beginning of a new quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Would you like to accept the quest?)</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were five enemies. Their level was estimated to be 35 or higher.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, I was alone and only level 3. I was also unharmed because I left my sword and armor in the warehouse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Should I refuse the quest? No.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I accept.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no reason for me to refuse this quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though I was level 3, my stats made me equivalent to a level 20. I also had the skill ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Patience.’ It was a tremendous skill that increased my concentration, stamina, and defense to the peak for an hour.&nbsp;</span><span style>But was that all? I had the passive skill that allowed me to become invincible for five seconds if my health was at the minimum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In fact, I’m not without a weapon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I opened my inventory. I took out one arrow that I had left behind as a souvenir.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Special Jaffa Arrow]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attack Power: 35~42</span></p>
 <p><span style>An arrow made by a craftsman with great skill and potential but lacking in experience and reputation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to the effect of combining jaffa with steel, it has extremely high penetration and ignores some of the enemy’s defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Has a certain chance of ignoring the enemy’s defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 0.1&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrows were consumables. But that was only when fired by a bow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I hold it and use it as a dagger, it won’t be a consumable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, there were many cases when arrows were retrieved and reused. It was said that most arrows could be reused except when it was too damaged by the target, but I didn’t know because I had no experience shooting the bow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I thought it was strange that arrows were so expensive so I grabbed a passerby. Thanks to that, I realized that arrows weren't always consumables. Huhut, information was power! I shouldn’t neglect the impact of &nbsp;gathering information in the future.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I smiled with satisfaction and examined the gangsters closely.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were holding threatening weapons like axes, swords, and maces while wearing leather armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'The heavens are helping me.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>It might be different if they were wearing iron armor. However, I could cause serious damage if I stabbed the leather armor several times with the Jaffa Arrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This arrow is something I made with my heart. Its value couldn’t be compared with normal arrows. I might have the attack power of a level 20 but I trust this arrow. Due to the option to ignore defense, I will be able to fill up the offensive gap. There is also the countless combat experiences I have accumulated in my days as a warrior.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>My stats that were higher than my level, a suitable weapon, a fraudulent skill and combat senses acquired from past experience.&nbsp;</span><span style>I believed that these four elements were enough to clear the quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is a very low possibility.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would I willingly accept a quest that was more likely to fail than succeed? It was obvious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>First, there was no penalty if the quest failed. The NPC Khan would die and all quests associated with him permanently destroyed, but it wasn’t something I should be afraid of since I didn’t know what the quests were.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Secondly, I was rewarded just by accepting the quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The quest has been accepted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Due to the quest acceptance, the skill ‘Blacksmith’s Rage’ has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The quest acceptance reward was different from the quest clear reward. It was a skill I received just by accepting the quest. Who would resist such a quest?&nbsp;</span><span style>I immediately opened the skills window to check the new skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Blacksmith’s Rage]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lv. 1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Increases attack power by 10% and attack speed by 30% for 20 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Mana Cost: 50</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: 60 seconds&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A-Amazing!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Production-related classes such as blacksmiths were said to not be able to learn combat skills. However, now I have learned a combat buff just by accepting a blacksmith related quest!&nbsp;</span><span style>Furthermore, its performance was enormous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Isn’t this a lot better than the combat buff skills I learned as a warrior?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The warrior buff skill that I used raised my attack power by 20% for a certain duration, and the cooldown time was three minutes. But the buff I just learn increased by attack power and attack speed, and the cooldown time was one minute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Isn’t this a windfall? Kukuk... Oh, is this the hidden quest that I’ve heard about? However, isn’t the quest difficulty too low for a hidden quest? Maybe this... it is likely to be a linked quest. The quests owned by Blacksmith Khan are probably linked quests. This is a real hit.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as I realized the importance of Blacksmith Khan, I had an obligation to do my best to clear the quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Thanks to the new skill, the possibility of clearing the quest is even higher... Good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I decided to approach the gangsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What the, this guy?”&nbsp;</span><span style>The gangsters tilted their heads as I came back instead of leaving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I pointed the arrow towards them. Then I explained to them the biggest reason why I accepted this quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You crossed the line. I am also indifferent to elderly people, but not as much as you. You don’t have to feel respect towards elderly people, but shouldn’t you maintain the minimum of courtesies? You should take care of your education, you bastards. I can’t forgive you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I wasn’t trying to imitate the apostle of justice.&nbsp;</span><span style>I just didn’t like people like these!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blame the fact that you look like Mother's Heart is Happy employees.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As I stepped closer, the gangsters started to grab their weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You bastard! This brat dares say such things to us? Eh? No, did something suddenly happen to this brat? Hey you! Do you want to go to hell? Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This bastard didn’t appreciate the fact that we let you go...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, lawless NPCs were fearsome.&nbsp;</span><span style>They instantly showed an intention to kill me. They were truly people who had committed numerous evils.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They are too formidable.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But there was no reason to avoid them due to fear.&nbsp;</span><span style>Right now, these people weren’t the objects of fear. They are targets that must be defeated to clear the quest.&nbsp;</span><span style>The ambition of a warrior was boiling inside of me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I snorted with derision towards the gangsters and raised my hand.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Stop your useless talking and come on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gangsters reacted immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This crazy bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Get him! Hold on to him for me! No, kill him! Just kill him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The red-faced gangsters rushed towards me.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were a total of five opponents.&nbsp;</span><span style>In a wide open space, I would be surrounded and die instantly.&nbsp;</span><span style>I had identified the terrain of the smithy ahead of time and headed for the stairs leading towards the second floor.&nbsp;</span><span style>The staircase was wide enough for two adult men to stand side by side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I stood in the middle of it with the arrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Anyone who wants to be stung should come up here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gangsters flinched when I took the geographical advantage, then belatedly confirmed the identity of the weapon in my hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is that? An arrow?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Puhahaha. Do you want to deal with us with that arrow? Where is your bow? Eh? Did you drop it on your mother’s skirt, Newbie?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Anyway, a blacksmith can’t use a bow. They don’t handle weapons very well. So it is no wonder he needs to swing an arrow. He is seriously young.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>These guys were belittling me!&nbsp;</span><span style>Among them, Johnson had the most vicious nature so he rushed forward first.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I will cut this blacksmith up like a bear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I faced Johnson, who had charged forward ignorantly like a wild boar, and used the skill I had just learned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blacksmith's Rage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Blacksmith’s Rage has been activated. Your attack power and attack speed will increase significantly for 20 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the top of the screen, a message with ‘20 seconds’ popped up. It was a notification window that showed the duration of the skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>I confirmed that the skill was successfully cast and quickly thrust out my arm.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Papat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was quicker than Johnson could swing his axe.&nbsp;</span><span style>My arrow pierced his chest twice.&nbsp;</span><span style>Large weapons had the advantage of high damage and durability, but they had a fatal disadvantage of slow attack speed.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, my attack was quick due to the weightless arrow. In addition, I used Blacksmith’s Rage and was able to overwhelm Johnson with speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The effect of the Special Jaffa arrow is activated, meaning the enemy’s defense is completely ignored.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ke...heok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only two attacks, but the full power was unleashed.&nbsp;</span><span style>One hit was a critical strike, while the other one ignored the defense due to the optional effect of the Special Jaffa Arrow.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this moment, I was sure that luck was following me.&nbsp;</span><span style>I never imagined that an arrow could deal damage like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"H-how...?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Johnson had a disbelieving expression on his face as the arrow pierced the leather armor. Then he coughed up blood and rolled down the stairs.&nbsp;</span><span style>He turned into a grey light and several messages popped up before my eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have defeated Winston’s outlaw, Johnson.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Reputation in Winston Village has increased by 60.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your relationship with the Winston outlaws has become hostile.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Winston outlaws will try to kill you when they find you.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[4,300 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I expected the gangster to be at least level 35.&nbsp;</span><span style>As if to prove my guess right, I gained five levels just from Johnson’s death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I defeated a level 35 enemy in just two hits?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I couldn’t believe it myself.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even if it was a critical hit and the enemy’s defense was ignored, I never expected to do it in only two hits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'These guys, do they have less health compared to their appearance?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a good explanation.&nbsp;</span><span style>Considering their aggressive tendencies, it was likely that the gangsters had focused their stats on strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Okay.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I felt more hope that I could clear this quest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Status window.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Grid&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level: 8 (125/1,400)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Class: Pagma’s Descendant</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The probability of adding additional options when making items will increase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The probably of item enhancement will increase.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>* All equipment items can be worn unconditionally. However, there is a penalty depending on the rating of the item.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: One who Became a Legend</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Abnormal conditions don’t work well on you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* You won’t die when health is at the minimum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Easily acknowledged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Health: 316/316 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana: 87/87</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strength: 24 &nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 22 &nbsp;&nbsp;Agility: 16 &nbsp;Intelligence: 29&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dexterity: 55 &nbsp;Persistence: 21</span></p>
 <p><span style>Composure: 14 &nbsp;Indomitable: 16 &nbsp;&nbsp;Dignity: 14 &nbsp;&nbsp;Insight: 14</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stat Points: 110</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 842/1,000&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>I gained five more levels, so now I had 110 stat points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is the right timing to distribute my stat points.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I didn’t hesitate to invest all my stat points in strength and agility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have invested 50 points in strength. Is this correct?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Once the points are invested, it can’t be reversed. Do you want to proceed?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have invested 60 points in agility. Is this correct?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The warning statements popped up and my strength and agility greatly increased.&nbsp;</span><span style>The other gangsters were surprised to see their companion suddenly die and couldn’t climb the stairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-W-What is that guy? How did he handle Johnson so easily?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Johnson wasn’t vigilant and allowed himself to be stabbed in the heart twice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, isn’t that bastard’s weapon just an arrow? It wasn’t shot from a bow, but a hand wielded arrow broke through leather armor and did such damage? Nonsense. It is impossible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...This blacksmith must be so strong that he doesn’t depend on weapons. Maybe he isn’t a blacksmith in the first place. He is a warrior. I’m sure of this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What does that... Maybe he just looks weak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't just pay attention to the outward appearance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gangsters watched me carefully.&nbsp;</span><span style>Blacksmith’s Rage only lasted 10 more seconds so I provoked them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing? Aren’t you attacking? Isn’t it four of you against one of me? You third-rate, hulking gangster scum.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Third-rate? What is this jerk seeing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Praga, wait!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite the calls from his companions, the gangster called Praga fell for the taunt and rushed.&nbsp;</span><span style>This time, the weapon was a huge mace.&nbsp;</span><span style>The attack speed was very slow, just like Johnson who used the axe.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwajajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He ran up the staircase and the mace aimed for my face.&nbsp;</span><span style>I avoided it as much as possible and pushed the arrow forward.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Papapat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>My increased agility was immediately effective.&nbsp;</span><span style>This time, I was able to strike the arrow three times before the enemy could attack once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Praga was stabbed three times in the chest and retreated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Dammit.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, there wasn’t a critical hit. In addition, the optional effect of the Special Jaffa Arrow wasn’t activated.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was that why?&nbsp;</span><span style>My attack power had increased thanks to the 50 points invested in strength, but Praga didn’t die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey, are you okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuoock... it isn’t enough to kill me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hmm... I guess it was just a coincidence that he took care of Johnson in two hits. The attack power seems weaker than I expected.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little by little, the gangsters started to identify my strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Veil explained to his men,&nbsp;</span><span style>"The thing we need to watch out for now is his attack speed. He is overwhelmingly faster than us because we use large weapons, so fighting one-on-one is definitely a disadvantage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What should we do? It is simple.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Veil winked and they stood as a group in front of the staircase. Then he spoke to me, who was standing alone on the staircase.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I won’t go up to grab you. You can’t stay up there forever. Won’t you eventually have to come down? Then I will kill you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heok... they were quite smart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If they were monsters, they would move without thinking.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>My plan to take advantage of the terrain was all in vain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There are four people remaining. One of them is seriously injured, but he can still fight. Damn... no matter what method I think of, it is too dangerous to deal with them all at once. How can I clear this quest?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I could be satisfied with the fact that I acquired a new skill through this quest.&nbsp;</span><span style>I was curious about the linked quests and rewards that would be received from Blacksmith Khan, but should I take the risk?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is wiser to forcibly quit the quest by running away, instead of dying. But...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>My eyes looked somewhere else.&nbsp;</span><span style>I flinched the moment I met the eyes of the old man standing in the corner, Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was it due to the expectations, hope, and gratitude in the eyes of the old man looking at me?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was like he was looking at a hero.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Don’t gaze at me with such eyes. I’m not a hero.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I tried to ignore the old man's gaze. Then I stopped just before logging out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Just accepting the quest gave me a new skill. I am 100% certain that this is a hidden quest. The rewards of the linked quests received from that old man must be beyond imagination. Isn’t it stupid to give up on a rare quest that I might not encounter again?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, I should try it.&nbsp;</span><span style>I headed down the stairs. I was immediately besieged by the gangsters waiting for me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'My defense is close to zero. My health is also small. If I allow these guys to attack, I will be killed in two or three hits, even if they aren’t fatal wounds. The important thing isn’t to fight as quickly as possible. Carefully, carefully.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I concentrated as much as possible, confirmed the cooldown time of Blacksmith’s Rage was over and used the skill again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blacksmith's Rage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Blacksmith’s Rage has been activated. Your attack power and attack speed will increase significantly for 20 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Okay. Next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Legendary Blacksmith’s Patience.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Nothing happens.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The skill didn’t activate?&nbsp;</span><span style>I was confused and hurriedly opened the skill window. Then I read the detailed explanation of the Legendary Blacksmith’s Patience skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Legendary Blacksmith’s Patience]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vitality, defense, and dexterity will rise by 200% for one hour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* This skill doesn’t consume mana.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>* This skill can’t be used intentionally. It was naturally be triggered if you continue to persevere.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Ah, you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This damn thing... A conditional activation skill?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I should’ve read the skill description... It is like not reading the fine print.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As one of the factors that I believed in disappeared, the gangsters narrowed the distance with their weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey, are you ready to go to hell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will make you pay for hurting and killing my companions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was screwed.</span></p>
