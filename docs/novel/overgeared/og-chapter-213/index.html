 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘He’s this strong?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Ashur was exposed to news about Grid’s actions in Reinhardt.&nbsp;</span><span style>The strongest golem army, that hundreds of thousands of troops couldn’t go against, was cut like carrots.&nbsp;</span><span style>But weren’t rumors always exaggerated?</span></p>
 <p><span style>During Grid’s novice adventurer days.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Ashur remembered that he had no talent and was a fool, so he had no choice but to laugh at the rumors.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid might have the ability of a legend, but it was dulled because he couldn’t use it properly. The nobles must’ve intentionally inflated the rumors in order to boost the morale of the people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But that wasn’t it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Grid was the hero in the rumors.&nbsp;</span><span style>At that moment, Earl Ashur’s memories of the beginner Grid were completely blown away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>His narrow perception disappeared and he started to perceive the current Grid correctly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Indeed, this is an absolute presence.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two eyes reminiscent of rotten fish. The mean eyes when facing the weak now shone as they contemplated the world in a much stronger face.&nbsp;</span><span style>The weak body that always shrank back. The pathetic flesh that ran away when hunting orcs and was killed by the orc captain, it was now standing firmly like a mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That disgusting face. He didn’t care about how he looked and was always jealous of others. That horrible face now emitted a dignity that charmed all the people of the kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is it possible for a person to change this way…?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You want me to beg for my life?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Ashur quietly observed Grid and the blue sword in his hand.&nbsp;</span><span style>The sword gleaming with a white light was something that could only be seen in legends.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Ashur felt a fear of death. His instincts were shouting at him to succumb to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the effect of Grid’s high dignity stat.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Earl Ashur had the highest pride as the strongest person in the Eternal Kingdom and a great magician, so he didn’t give in easily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’d rather die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hadn’t been sure Pagma’s Rare Book actually existed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Ashur decided to use Grid, who was easy to take advantage of. However, he gave reasonable compensation and didn’t put a time limit on the quest. It was a quest he seriously entrusted to Grid, because he believed in Grid’s inherent tenacity. Did he give a novice adventurer the quest in an attempt to trick him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, it was Grid who abandoned the faith first. Grid was blinded by greed after discovering Pagma’s Rare Book and broke the promise, trying to take the book for himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘That wasn’t all.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>His precious son Bland had been in love with Irene for many years.&nbsp;</span><span style>The woman who seemed likely to marry Bland had been taken away by Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was better to choose death than to submit to Grid, who wasn’t just his enemy, but his son’s enemy as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was baffled as he watched Earl Ashur tightly close his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'He really wants me to kill him?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had hated Earl Ashur since he was killed. But it</span><span style>&nbsp;was his choice to quickly find Pagma’s Rare Book without understanding the subject. He wasn’t forced by Earl Ashur. Nevertheless, whenever he suffered a trial, he blamed everything on Earl Ashur.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His habit of blaming others was the problem. Strictly speaking, there was no reason for Grid to resent Earl Ashur. If Pagma’s Rare Book hadn’t existed, Grid wouldn’t have found it or turned into Pagma’s Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a result, Earl Ashur was Grid’s benefactor.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, that was just the result, and there was no need for Grid to feel gratitude.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was through Grid’s willpower that he found Pagma’s Rare Book and became Pagma’s Descendant. It was due to Grid’s own efforts that he could grow until now, and it wasn’t thanks to Earl Ashur.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyway, this was the conclusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have overwhelmed him but... Looking at this, I don’t need to kill him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid still didn’t like Earl Ashur.&nbsp;</span><span style>In fact, he had the experience of being murdered by Earl Ashur’s knights, and he had been directly threatened with death by Earl Ashur, so it wasn’t easy to feel forgiveness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it wasn’t enough to feel the urge to murder him.&nbsp;</span><span style>His conscience didn’t allow him to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sigh, okay. Forget it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Ashur was confused as Grid sighed and took back his sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I tried to kill you. But you will spare me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Ashur’s strength transcended his title, but he was still an earl. Grid was a duke, but Earl Ashur treated him badly and even tried to kill him because of a grudge of the past.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now that he discovered that Grid was really qualified to be a duke, Earl Ashur was aware that he committed a crime. He thought it was natural to be executed, so he couldn’t accept this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is there something you will demand separately of me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Ashur eyed Grid warily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I had mercy on him, yet he’s still doubting me?’&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid's heart beat faster.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The Grid of the past would’ve been swept away by his emotions and spoken nonsense.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘It’s better to ask for something in exchange for saving him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had learned to take advantage of certain situations. He had learned it by watching Lauel for three months.&nbsp;</span><span style>What could he get from Earl Ashur?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid thought about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Money? Jewelry? Land? Items?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was greedy.&nbsp;</span><span style>As Grid was deeply troubled about what he should ask for, Lauel sent him a whisper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Grid, everyone has arrived in Reidan except for Euphemina.</span></i> <i><span style>When are you going to arrive?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I think it will take three more days.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Three days?</span></i> <i><span style>What is taking so long? </span></i><i><span style>Can’t you come quickly if you use Fly?</span></i> <i><span style>Come quickly.</span></i> <i><span style>There is a mountain of work to do.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I have a companion.</span></i> <i><span style>But my companion doesn’t want to ride a carriage, so we’re walking.</span></i> <i><span style>Just handle things for a few days.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Companion...?</span></i> <i><span style>Who are you talking about?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>You’ll see when you meet him.</span></i> <i><span style>It is good that you got in touch with me.</span></i> <i><span style>I actually...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid briefly explained to Lauel about the relationship between him and Earl Ashur, as well as the current situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-...</span><i><span style>In these circumstances, what should I ask from Earl Ashur?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Earl Ashur...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As one of the 10 great magicians on the continent, Earl Ashur was a huge celebrity. Lauel already knew about him, so he thought carefully before asking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>There is a story I’ve heard from Vantner.</span></i> <i><span style>I heard he caused a disturbance along with Earl Ashur’s son on the day of your wedding to Irene?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Really?</span></i> <i><span style>I didn’t know.</span></i> <i><span style>I couldn’t pay attention to anything else on that day.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Pay attention to him.</span></i> <i><span style>Ask Earl Ashur to give you his son.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Eh?</span></i> <i><span style>What are you saying?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel clearly predicted that Grid wouldn’t understand and added a detailed explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Earl Ashur is famous for his love for his son.</span></i> <i><span style>If you keep his son, he won’t be able to go against you again and he will have to move according to your will.</span></i> <i><span style>Earl Ashur’s mighty power will surely help one day.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘What a great guy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel looked at benefits rather than money, so Grid thought he was truly great.&nbsp;</span><span style>One day he would become smart like Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style>A wicked smile appeared on Grid’s face and Earl Ashur’s anxiety was heightened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Grid demanded,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Give me your son."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What...?”&nbsp;</span><span style>It was like a bolt out of the blue to Earl Ashur.&nbsp;</span><span style>He absolutely couldn’t accept it.&nbsp;</span><span style>“You mean to take my son hostage!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 48 year old Earl Ashur was still young and beautiful. His appearance was like the protagonist of a manhwa, and he had been very popular since childhood. When he was a young man and still active among the social circles, dozens of women clung to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Earl Ashur only loved one woman. She wasn’t beautiful, but Earl Ashur fell for her warm-heartedness.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their marriage was successful. They had two sons and lived happily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a short moment of happiness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, Earl Ashur’s wife suffered from a terminal illness and died at a young age. Earl Ashur tasted the pain of his heart breaking. However, he didn’t have time to mourn. He had an obligation to defend the kingdom and had to take care of his two young sons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Ashur was faithful to his duties and raised his sons at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style>His first son became a royal mage, and his second son became a magic swordsman because he showed talent in both magic and swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Ashur was able to fill the blank spot left by his wife with his pride for his two sons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the heavens were too harsh on Earl Ashur.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just two years ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>His first son went on a monster conquest and died.&nbsp;</span><span style>After that, Earl Ashur’s nature became somewhat strange.&nbsp;</span><span style>His gentleness disappeared. However, he still cared about his remaining son.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bland was his only blood, and Earl Ashur cherished him more than his own life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"My flesh and soul might burn, but I will never sell my son. Just kill me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Stubborn...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>What should he do?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid wasn’t smart, so the only method he could come up with was to use force. But this problem didn’t need to be resolved with force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will follow you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A blond man appeared while Grid was feeling confused.&nbsp;</span><span style>The person was Bland.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why are you...!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bland ignored the panicked Earl Ashur and bowed before Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I, Bland de Ian, son of Earl Ashur, greet Duke Grid, the great hero of this kingdom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bland and Grid had dueled once over Irene. But in the end, Bland was defeated and kicked out from the wedding.&nbsp;</span><span style>After that, he lived in pain for a while, but now he was determined.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will go to Reidan according to Duke Grid’s will.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the only way to save his father.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Ashur’s face turned white.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bland! Why are you deciding this by yourself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was the rival who deprived Bland of his beloved.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Ashur couldn’t tolerate his son being Grid’s hostage.&nbsp;</span><span style>He started to gather magic power in his pained body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will kill you and give your soul to God Yatan if you touch one hair on my son!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bland came forward before Grid could frown.&nbsp;</span><span style>He fell to his knees.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duke Grid, my father lost his temper because he cares too much about me. Please show mercy one more time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“B-Bland...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was begging to his rival because of his father!&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Ashur was shocked by causing more humiliation to his son and fell silent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Bland reassured him.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Father, I will go and study under Duke Grid. Please trust in your son and wait for me to return. Don’t skip any meals.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ugh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Ashur was frustrated.&nbsp;</span><span style>His eyes had been clouded by his grudge, and now his son was taken as a hostage.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid placed a hand on his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Earl Ashur, don’t worry. I will look after your son.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ssik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t he a demon?&nbsp;</span><span style>He could smile brightly and enjoy the pain and sorrows of others. To Earl Ashur, Grid didn’t look like a human.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid was obviously a human.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Please don’t overdo it. I won’t eat your son.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid inwardly spoke before glancing at Piaro and Bland.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a few moments.&nbsp;</span><span style>The only thing left was a disastrous scene where Earl Ashur looked completely insane and the wounded knights looked wretched.</span></p>
