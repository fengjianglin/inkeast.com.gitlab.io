 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘The more I look, the more impressive it is.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had to admit it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mumud’s Orb was truly qualified to be called the best.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition to being able to possess magic, it had a number of functions that were different from ordinary orbs, such as increasing the casting speed of magic and reducing skill cooldown time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the magic damage was somewhat plain. Of course, it was excellent compared to other orbs, but lacking compared to the other features.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why was this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid pondered. Then he realized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Balance. Magic damage was intentionally suppressed to maintain balance. If the basic performance is good along with the additional options, it will inevitably lead to higher usage conditions.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a great study for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘When I create new items in the future, I have to pay attention to the balance.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first item that Grid created, Failure, only specialized in aggression. Indeed, it showed tremendous attack power.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he was to exclude the weapons possessed by Rebecca’s Daughters, he could positively assert that Failure was currently the strongest weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But in return, Failure had ridiculously high usage conditions. It required Advanced Sword Mastery level 8 and more than 5,000 strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was estimated that users with more than 5,000 strength wouldn’t appear for at least two years, so Failure was nothing but a special item for Grid until then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Failure was a failure for a reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I designed it to be more versatile like Mumud’s Orb by lowering the attack power...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The usage conditions would’ve been lowered and it would be more usable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Then by now, I would be sitting in money.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the moment he learned how to create the best items with the right level of performance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was enlightened and felt a huge sense of accomplishment. He was filled with joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can see a way to improve the Mass-produced One-handed Sword. Okay. Then let’s get started.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smiled and started to observe the materials needed to make Mumud’s Orb.&nbsp;</span><span style>The abyss mithril, Frost Queen’s Breath and Water Clan King’s Tears were unfamiliar items.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was deeply interested.&nbsp;</span><span style>However...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s expression twisted after he checked the details of the items.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was unbelievable that he had been smiling with joy just a moment ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Frost Queen’s Breath]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The extremely low temperature climate of Heraris caused the Frost Queen’s breath to crystallize. This crystal will never melt and has the effect of amplifying magic power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 0.1</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Abyss Mithril]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deep in the ocean.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A rare mineral that is only found near the Siren Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Its harmony with magic power is three times better than normal mithril.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 15</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Water Clan King’s Tears]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Siren King sheds tears every five months, longing for his daughter who left the world before him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These tears have the mysterious function of imbuing items with magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 0.1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was happy at first.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because he easily figured out how to create magic possession items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The secret is the tears of the Water Clan. If I design an item with this as the material, I can create magic items that possess spells.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>What if S-grade magic was attached to weapons and armor?&nbsp;</span><span style>He would become incomparably stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If my armor has Counter Barrier and my weapon has Meteor, I can be a 100 man... no, a 1,000 man army?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maybe it would be enough to fight with the great demon Hell Gao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Then what about the pavranium?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>What if magic possession items were made out of pavranium?&nbsp;</span><span style>The golden discs that could drop Meteor from the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>Golden blades that fired all types of spells while flying.&nbsp;</span><span style>Golden boomerangs that could create a sea of fire.&nbsp;</span><span style>Golden needles that could emit lightning.&nbsp;</span><span style>Golden items with all types of magic attached to them would reign hell down on his opponents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From then on, a true overgeared person would be born.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am a genius.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought about the good idea for a while. The momentum lasted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But then his face distorted.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was one part that disturbed him from the beginning.&nbsp;</span><span style>How was Euphemina able to obtain the abyss mithril and Water Clan King’s Tears?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The first discoverer of the Siren Kingdom. It was Euphemina.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>How much did she gain as the first discoverer of the Siren Kingdom?&nbsp;</span><span style>The amount of money would be huge. When considering the quests and titles, he was sure that she would’ve benefited beyond imagination.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Shake shake.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuoh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>How did Grid feel about it? His stomach started cramping.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was conflicted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I want to return the favor by making a unique rated orb, but...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to Euphemina, he was able to acquire a precious production method and learned how to make magic possession items.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was so grateful that he wanted to do something for her. He might seem simple, but now he felt a huge affinity with Euphemina. He didn’t feel reluctant to see her anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But Euphemina has more luck than a lottery winner. Wouldn’t it be nice to let her experience some trials?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was blinded by jealousy.&nbsp;</span><span style>He might’ve matured compared to the past, but human nature didn’t change easily.&nbsp;</span><span style>After all, Grid was still active as keyboard warrior. In the end, he eventually started with the intention of shoddily making an orb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He poured the abyss mithril into the furnace and worked the bellows. It was silent.&nbsp;</span><span style>But then, “Sigh. I can’t do this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This rottenness wouldn’t help him in the long run.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid controlled his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he took a serious posture.&nbsp;</span><span style>He smelted the abyss mithril to the best of his ability.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He started to make the ornaments and handle part of the orb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The work had to be careful in order to properly express the old-fashioned design and make it a perfect fit.&nbsp;</span><span style>The extremely focused Grid handled the Legendary Blacksmith’s Hammer very delicately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three hours later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid finally completed the handle and started smelting the magic stones. Then according to the process described in the production method, he mixed the Frost Queen’s Breath with the Water Clan King’s Tears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Strange.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The finished crystal glistened with a blue color. As the name suggested, this was a transparent crystal.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it was as hard as steel.&nbsp;</span><span style>The magic stones, Frost Queen’s Breath and Water Clan King’s Tears combined into one and were reborn as a whole new mineral.&nbsp;</span><span style>Just as Pagma and Braham created the mineral called pavranium, Milepeu created this blue crystal mineral.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Milepeu... he was an amazing person. Then Euphemina will take this special mineral as well as being the Siren Kingdom’s first discoverer?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid couldn’t help feeling jealous of Euphemina again. Naturally, his hands became dull.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i> <i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The crystal that was supposed to have a smooth bead shape became distorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid looked at the shabby appearance caused by his jealousy and controlled his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Wake up.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid focused. He tried to get rid of his malice. He did his best to deal with the delicate modifications.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The crystal ball became increasingly beautiful and sleek.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had a hunch that at least an epic rated orb would be produced.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s stomach cramps appeared again at this thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuoh...!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why did he have to give the best gift to Euphemina, who was already the first discoverer of the Siren Kingdom?&nbsp;</span><span style>Was it fair for one person to have such a monopoly on good luck?</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Dammit! I should make it rare rated.'</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i> <i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s hammering once again became sloppy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But then,</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘...This isn’t it. Euphemina gave me a big present...’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He worked delicately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Ohh! First she has the fraudulent class of Duplicator, now she found the Siren Kingdom...’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i> <i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>More shoddy work.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Then he did his best.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i> <i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shoddy work.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t know how many times this repeated.&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to this uncontrollable behavior, Grid was like a madman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah... what am I doing now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he knew it, a whole night passed.&nbsp;</span><span style>The crystal ball was finished perfectly when seen from the outside.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Clink.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Despite the unfaithful attitude of the maker, a blue crystal ball with a beautiful shape attached to blue silver handles could be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sigh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t know how many times he sighed during this work. It must’ve been at least 100 times.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yet he didn’t stop working. Grid’s heart didn’t wander anymore as he finished the job.&nbsp;</span><span style>And along the way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Patience skill has been activated. Concentration, stamina and defense will rise to the extremes for one hour.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath has increased the effectiveness of your production items]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t know whether to be happy or sad at the notification windows that flashed in succession.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the result.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Indecisive Mumud’s Orb]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 311/311 &nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Damage: +34%</span></p>
 <p><span style>Magic Casting Speed: +23%</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number of spells that can be stored: 4</span></p>
 <p><span style>* You can permanently store one spell at or below the S-grade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* 15% reduction in skill cooldown time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a certain chance that magic damage will decrease by 50%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a certain chance that magic damage will increase by 100%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* When using the possessed magic, there is a certain chance of the effect halving or doubling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Among the items made by the great blacksmith ‘G,’ this is the third piece born with emotions.&nbsp;</span><span style>It has been affected by the indecisiveness of its creator.&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to the emotional ups and down, it might not work properly or perform better than expected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The compatibility with its creator will differ depending on its mood on the day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>User Restriction: Level 280 or higher. More than 3,000 intelligence. Advanced Orb Mastery Level 5.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 150</span></p>
 <p><span style>[An legendary rated item was produced, so all stats have permanently risen by +10 and reputation throughout the continent has risen by +500.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...This, is it okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid found it difficult to predict how Euphemina would react.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill Lv. 4 increased the basic abilities of the item by 18% and the Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath Lv. 3 increased it by 8%, so the basic performance of the orb rose sharply. However, he was uneasy because the power might be halved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How did it turn out like this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was worried about the finished orb, even if it had a legendary rating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t know.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, Euphemina acquired the title of ‘Competitor’ for winning the item production game and opened the good luck stat. After that, she was more likely to get a positive result when it came to random effects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Amazing...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina was completely thrilled by the orb.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her face brightened like the dawn and she even shed tears.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reaction was natural.&nbsp;</span><span style>The orb Grid produced far exceeded her expectations. Moreover, the random option made it seem like an exclusive item just for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina was truly impressed. It was even greater than the joy she felt at discovering the Siren Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm really grateful. Encountering you was the best luck I ever had.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The smiling Euphemina still looked pretty, despite her runny nose. This was the first time Grid truly saw her without any pretenses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, why are you crying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s jealousy had already disappeared like melted snow.&nbsp;</span><span style>On this day.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid achieved great growth as a blacksmith and overcame the ‘Believe in me’ jinx. And Euphemina became a slave to the power of items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi and Lauel really liked their new colleague.</span></p>
