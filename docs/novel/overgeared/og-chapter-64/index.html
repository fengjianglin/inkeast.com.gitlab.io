 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>My family was relieved of the immediate crisis because of the money I earned. I was able to avoid the worst situation, where our assets would’ve been seized by paying the overdue interest caused by my father’s friend running away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hum hum hum~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My mother hummed to herself with a bright expression. Sehee also felt good as she held hands with my mother.&nbsp;</span><span style>As I watched the warm sight of my mother and daughter walking together, my father spoke next to me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’m indebted to my son. I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, indebted? Why are you saying that to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Hey, this is a matter of a man’s pride.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Somehow, I felt like I could understand my father.&nbsp;</span><span style>I shut my mouth as my father placed an arm over my shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The rush is gone, so don’t worry about the future. Your mother and I will work hard and pay off the remaining debt within three years. I will also repay the 240 million won that I borrowed from you. Your mother and I are capable of at least that much. So don’t worry about it anymore, and just do what you want to do. You’re 26, one of the most important periods in your life. I will make sure that your path is clear, so do your best. If the path you decided to walk if playing a game... try to be the best there. I’m cheering you on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My father said so, but the remaining 600 million won was too much for my parents to pay back.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even if my father didn’t like it, I would be sure to help him.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was atonement for being a bad son.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But before that, I had to clarify one thing.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Father, I gave you 240,800,000 won, not 240 million. Don’t forget the 800,000 won.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sky was blue.&nbsp;</span><span style>My heart was blue.&nbsp;</span><span style>The useless son was transforming into someone dependable after obtaining a legendary class and making a legendary item.&nbsp;</span><span style>I felt fulfilled as I grew as a person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>...Although I still didn’t escape a debt.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’ll give up on going to the reunion this year.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The atmosphere in Winston was chaotic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you hear? The Yatan Temple defeated the troops again. Captain Phoenix was seriously injured..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No way? Captain Phoenix is the strongest knight! He lost, even though he led the army himself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s rumored that the opponent was one of the Seven Servants.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"W-What? Did Winston earn the wrath of the Seven Servants? What will happen to Winston in the future?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah... we barely escaped from the Mero Company, and now we have to go through something like this...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long ago, a Yatan Temple was discovered in the outskirts of Winston.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lady Irene dispatched troops three times to get rid of the temple, but all three times were a failure.&nbsp;</span><span style>The opponent was one of the Seven Servants who could make a child start crying... Honestly, I didn’t really care.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That story has nothing to do with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I left behind the anxious residents and entered Khan’s smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then I thought about my future as I touched the 20,000 gold I had left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’ll get big profits when completing an item with a high rating. On the other hand, I will receive big damage if the item has a low rating.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to the Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill and Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath, the stats of an item could increase by 19%. But I might not be able to obtain the original value if I made a level 160 normal rated item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, making an item with high usage conditions wasn’t always profitable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I should make an item that won’t cause huge damages, even if it ends up being normal rated.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a reality that when I created items, the normal rating almost always popped up.&nbsp;</span><span style>Taking this into consideration, I decided to make a level 140 item that would still earn me a profit even if it had a normal rating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I need to pay off the debt quickly.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I had to work very hard to pay off the 600 million won debt and the interest each month.&nbsp;</span><span style>I looked at my status window before starting work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Grid</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level: 45 (3,400/238,000)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Class: Pagma’s Descendant</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The probability of adding additional options when making items will increase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The probably of item enhancement will increase.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>* All equipment items can be worn unconditionally. However, there is a penalty depending on the rating of the item.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: One who Became a Legend</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Abnormal conditions don’t work well on you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* You won’t die when health is at the minimum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Easily acknowledged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: First Unique Item Maker</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Dexterity +200</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: Only Legendary Item Maker</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Dexterity +350</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: Knight Slayer</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Stamina +100.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Strength +30</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: Apostle of Justice</span></p>
 <p><span style>* All stats +10.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The Apostle of Justice’s bravery is unmatched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Health: 5,682/5,682 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana: 504/504</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strength: 393 &nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 411 &nbsp;&nbsp;Agility: 195 &nbsp;Intelligence: 168&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dexterity: 838 &nbsp;Persistence: 190</span></p>
 <p><span style>Composure: 143 &nbsp;Indomitable: 162 &nbsp;&nbsp;Dignity: 143 Insight: 143</span></p>
 <p><span style>Courage: 87</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stat Points: 0</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 842/11,660&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>All my stats had risen tremendously after creating various epic items and the one legendary item. In particular, my dexterity and persistence stat had increased significantly during the process of making items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I had surpassed the stats of a level 80 warrior a long time ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to this, I wanted to run to the hunting grounds straight away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘With these stats and the Ideal Dagger... I can easily hunt level 100 monsters after making a few pieces of armor.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was exciting to swing a sword at monsters. I could acquire items and experience, eventually leveling up.&nbsp;</span><span style>The excitement that could only be found when raising my level through hunting!&nbsp;</span><span style>It had been months since I felt that feeling!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘...Forget it. I have to earn money.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I held a hammer instead of a sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an old hammer that I had been using for many months now!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The durability is falling faster... Hrmm, should I make a new one?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I didn’t know how to make a hammer, but I could make a simple one with my capabilities.&nbsp;</span><span style>I put iron in the furnace for the sake of making a hammer.&nbsp;</span><span style>Khan asked from where he was watching on the sidelines. “What type of work are you making this time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hammer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m making a hammer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh...? Are you going to use the hammer you’re making?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I nodded and Khan spoke with confusion.&nbsp;</span><span style>“You’ve been using that hammer for the last few months, so I thought there was a special story regarding that hammer...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Story? There isn’t anything like that. This is the only hammer I have, so I just used it. There’s no special meaning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, then why didn’t you make a new hammer sooner?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, what a surprise! Why are you shouting all of a sudden?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan explained.&nbsp;</span><span style>“There are four important things when making battle gear! First! Outstanding techniques. Second! The materials. Third! Patience and devotion. Fourth! A hammer with a good performance. But you have been using that garbage like hammer for no special reason! This is really ridiculous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I brought up the details of the hammer I used.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Blacksmith’s Hammer]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 50/70 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 18~25</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hammer used by a blacksmith to make items, but it can also be used as a weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Conditions of Use: None.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 60&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>I got this hammer from Bairan Village and there were no special features. I always thought that all production hammers were the same.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Khan’s response told me differently.&nbsp;</span><span style>I tried appraising Khan’s hammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Legendary Blacksmith’s Appraisal.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The blacksmith who becomes a legend that appraises items with an excellent discerning eye. If a hidden feature exists in the target item, it will be found.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Excellent Blacksmith’s Hammer]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Rare</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 166/250 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 40~50&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Odds of Making a Rare Rated Item: +10%</span></p>
 <p><span style>A blacksmith hammer that Khan inherited from his father. It can still be used on a daily basis because he uses it carefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>User Restriction: Level 80 or higher. More than 60 strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Intermediate Blacksmith skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 80&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A hidden function doesn’t exist.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have grasped the materials that make up the Excellent Blacksmith’s Hammer, the production method and the intentions of its creator.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your understanding of the Excellent Blacksmith’s Hammer is now at 100%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have learned how to make the Excellent Blacksmith’s Hammer.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was true.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hammers also had several ratings and options.&nbsp;</span><span style>If I knew this, I would’ve thrown the crappy hammer away and made an epic rated hammer!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought that all production hammers were the same.”&nbsp;</span><span style>I shouted towards the air, before looking at Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style>“What? Why? Why didn’t you tell me that hammers were so important? How long were you going to watch while I used this old hammer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan was embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You’re Pagma’s Descendant, so I never imagined that you wouldn’t even know the basics... As I said earlier, I thought you were using the old hammer because there was a special story...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now wasn’t the time to blame Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style>I hurriedly started making a hammer.&nbsp;</span><span style>Normal rated hammers emerged, but I continued sweating and was able to make an epic rated hammer on the sixth attempt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Unknown Blacksmith’s Hammer]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 350/350 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 70~80&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Odds of Making a Rare Rated Item: +17%&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Odds of Making an Epic Rated Item: +7%</span></p>
 <p><span style>A blacksmith’s hammer made by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but his experience and reputation is somewhat lacking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This is a hammer produced by the craftsman himself, so it isn’t suitable for other blacksmiths to use.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Conditions of Use: Pagma’s Descendant</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 80&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was it because I specifically designed it?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Only Pagma’s Descendant could use it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Out of two billion Satisfy users, it was an item only I could use.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the options weren’t so great compared to the conditions of use.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If it’s only for Pagma’s Descendant, it should increase the rate of making unique and legendary items... In any case, this is a stingy game. Huh? The item description changed?’</span></p>
