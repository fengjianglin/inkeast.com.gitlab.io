 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style> “Amazing! Amazing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The directors and PDs of the broadcasting stations relaying the Reinhardt war were excited.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s companions played an active role against the golems and audience ratings were high, so it was natural to feel excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid is a genuine star!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This golem army had smashed the 700 Giant Guild members led by the 3rd ranked Chris, whose battle power was evaluated as over the Tzedakah Guild in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Indeed, Grid was a legend.&nbsp;</span><span style>Whenever he appeared in public, he overwhelmed the audience with his power, causing the audience ratings to rise every time he appeared. He created the buzzword ‘Praise God Grid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It would be nice if he summoned Noe...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, human greed was endless!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The station PDs were hoping for the appearance of Noe, who was just as popular as Grid. If the cute Noe emerged, the audience ratings would clearly rise because the hearts of the children and female viewers would be captured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the hosts’ mouths were dry from praising Grid’s group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 The orator’s buffs and debuffs are only applied once, but they are extremely effective. If they are used well, an orator can play a more active role than existing buffing classes. It’s a class that deserves to be reevaluated. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Reevaluated? Don’t you know about orators? Orators are a class that had been treated as top rankers by the nobles since the beginning. But they are difficult to find because they’re a difficult class to level up. 』&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 The advantage of an orator isn’t only the buffs and debuffs. A orator is basically a speech-giving class. They are politically useful. It is natural for the top rankers to be jealous of Grid for acquiring the 1st ranked orator. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Lauel is truly worthy of his fame. He fully understands the qigong master class. Rather than acting aggressively, he serves as a supporter and assists Grid. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 In fact, qigong masters are more suitable to be rear damage dealers rather than supporters. But since Grid is in the party, there’s enough attack power. Therefore, his role in the group is changed. Lauel’s flexible mindset is great. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Above all, the best one is the user called Euphemina. She can cast all types of spells without chanting? It’s obvious that she has a hidden class, and she might be stronger than Grid. Perhaps she is a legendary grade magician? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 If you look at the fact that she doesn’t show many S-grade magic, it’s hard to imagine her as a legendary magician. It is more likely that she’s a unique rated magician. Anyway, I am certain that she is better than Yura and Bondre. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 I’m focused on the girl called Ruby. She is a complete beginner when looking at her clothing, but isn’t she supporting her colleagues with tremendous amounts of healing? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Sometimes, there are people with unique tastes. There are many high level users who deliberately look like beginners... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Didn’t the rare class Skin Creator recently appeared? The Skin Creator can freely change the appearance of items, right? Maybe the clothes she’s wearing now are actually really dazzling. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Is that rough-looking wooden staff actually a unique-rated weapon? Hahaha, in any case, Grid is really great. He has the named NPC Jude, the 1st ranked orator, the 1st ranked qigong master as well as the best magicians and priest as his companions... It’s clear that he has a great personality. 』&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 I agree with you 100 times over. He must be charming to attract such excellent people. Grid has to be a generous, charismatic, wise, and good man. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the misunderstanding about Grid deepened, Grid’s group was defeating the sixth ancient weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style>The remaining six ancient weapons were upgraded based on the information gathered from the destroyed ancient weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[It is necessary to become tolerant to spiteful words.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Delete language comprehension feature.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is pretty hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was hard for Grid to look relaxed.&nbsp;</span><span style>The ancient weapons became noticeably stronger every time one was destroyed.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s why their combat power rose from 26,000 to 32,000. It was around the same level of the Awakened Guardian of the Forest.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s party faced difficulties the moment the sixth ancient weapon was killed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Spiteful Tongue isn’t working.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The resistance to qi has increased, so my skills aren’t being applied properly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The durability of the Anti-magic Shield has risen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid could feel the physical defense of the ancient weapons rising.&nbsp;</span><span style>He trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The golems grow as we fight. What type of freak made these monsters?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They might be able to destroy some more, but it was difficult to predict how strong the remaining ancient weapon would be.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no chance of victory. We should retreat. Didn’t we do enough?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But if we retreat, Reinhardt will eventually collapse. The kingdom contribution that we earned will become useless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A skeptical mood began to form.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s only method was to rely on Lauel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there a solution?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The solution is simple. Destroy the remaining six ancient weapons simultaneously.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an impossible task.&nbsp;</span><span style>Assuming that Grid alone could handle an ancient weapon, the rest of the group couldn’t take care of even one ancient weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was impossible to kill six ancient weapons at the same time, even if all of the 100,000 watching users joined.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Earl Steim noticed the situation and directly commanded the army.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The only solution is to destroy those large golems at the same time. Winston’s army! Everyone join forces to help my son-in-law defend this kingdom!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ohhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Steim raised the morale of the army by appealing to the fact that his son-in-law was a legendary warrior!&nbsp;</span><span style>He was a seasoned leader and reorganized the army with the strongest knights of each region at the forefront, advancing them towards the six ancient weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style>His fighting spirit caught the aggro of the ancient weapons.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jeeeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The ancient weapons concentrated their magic power rays at Earl Steim.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father-in-law!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had a quest called ‘Save Earl Steim.’&nbsp;</span><span style>The damage caused by the quest failure was a problem, but he also didn’t want to see Irene sad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn bastards!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He tried to fly at full speed to protect Earl Steim, but it was useless.&nbsp;</span><span style>The magic power rays far exceeded Grid’s speed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The six rays of magic energy struck Earl Steim and caused a powerful explosion. The soldiers near him flew away and became rags.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Steim at the center of the explosion must be reduced to ashes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father-in-law...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was shaken.&nbsp;</span><span style>She had the most beautiful smile, but he was pained at the thought of his Irene crying for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then a familiar woman’s voice was heard.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I’m sorry I’m late.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid closed his eyes because he was afraid to confirm the death of Earl Steim. He slowly opened his eyes. Then he saw it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You struggled to fight without us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>Armed with epic, unique and legendary items that had G engraved on them, Vantner and Toban protected Earl Steim while Jishuka and the others surrounded them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka spoke to the thrilled Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Please give us a command, Captain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the moment when the Tzedakah Guild expressed their intention to go under Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel shouted,&nbsp;</span><span style>“First of all, establish the guild!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A minimum of 15 people were required to establish a guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>The golem army invasion had another quest for guilds, so this was a perfect opportunity to raise the guild experience.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid grasped Lauel’s intention and acted quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Establish Guild.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[To establish a guild, you need to get approval from the association.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You can set up the guild without an approval procedure because you are a high-ranking noble.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Please decide the name of the guild.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The guild name...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel prompted Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The guild name is a very important symbol for the guild. It should be a meaningful and cool name. Personally, I recommend Darkfire Masters, Blood Ice Makers, The Blessed of the Gods, Silver Dragons, etc.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had called himself overgeared since the time of the Neberius raid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a wordplay based on the templar knights. (TL: In Korean, not English.)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid really liked the word. The word was moved around his mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style>The guild name...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Overgeared Knights is more extravagant than necessary... Let’s just stick to the simple Overgeared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-What?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel was shocked. His face turned white and anger filled his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Overgeared, are you thinking properly? It’s completely childish! Elementary school students will laugh at the name! Please be joking!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Blood Ice Makers? I think Overgeared is a lot better than that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about Blood Ice Makers? It’s cool! On the contrary, what is Overgeared? This guild name will stick with us for the rest of all lives, so it needs to be better!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was extremely opposed, but the reaction of the Tzedakah Guild members were unexpectedly positive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Overgeared... It clearly expresses the characteristics of the guild.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The names of the other guilds are too extravagant and childish. This is simple and clear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Overgeared people belong to the Overgeared Guild! Kukuk, it’s simple and entertaining!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T-These crazy people...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel felt like he was in a nightmare. He sent a look of help towards Huroi and Euphemina, but it was useless.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi only followed Grid’s will and Euphemina didn’t care about the name of the guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>['Grid’ and 27 companions have established the Overgeared Guild.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guild Name: Overgeared</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level: 1 (0/100,000)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reputation: 0</span></p>
 <p><span style>Master: Grid</span></p>
 <p><span style>Capacity: 28/30</span></p>
 <p><span style>Affiliation: The Eternal Kingdom</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alliances: North of the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hostile Relationships: None</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inclination: An unconditionally favorable relationship with Winston.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Territory: None</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T-This is ridiculous... The guild name is Overgeared...? I am an overgeared!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel seemed like he received a really big shock.&nbsp;</span><span style>In fact, the name ‘Overgeared’ was favored by the public, so Lauel was the only one who didn’t like it.&nbsp;</span><span style>A new quest window appeared in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Defense War II]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Difficulty Level: SS</span></p>
 <p><span style>The golem army was much more powerful than anyone expected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The kingdom’s strongest guilds and armies couldn’t prevent the golems from advancing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The most powerful golems called the ancient weapons have plunged the Eternal Kingdom into a crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Defend the Eternal Kingdom by defeating them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only you are the last hope of the Eternal Kingdom. The anxious King Wiesbaden can only rely on you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Conditions: Defeat the ancient weapons (0/6)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Rewards: One big city. 50,000 contribution to the kingdom. The guild level will rise by 2. Five million gold will be obtained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Failure: The likely collapse of the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clearly an opportunity.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid ordered everyone, including the frustrated Lauel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Defeat the six ancient weapons at the same time. Huroi! Toban! Buffs!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the first time that the legendary Overgeared group left their footsteps in history.</span></p>
