 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Four months ago in Satisfy time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel had spent one month with Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>He watched Piaro’s every move and they sparred together 30 times. He personally witnessed when Piaro became a legendary farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thus, Kraugel knew Piaro’s strength better than anyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The basic level difference is huge.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the time of separation, Piaro was level 380.&nbsp;</span><span style>This wasn’t mere speculation.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was calculated using all types of indicators, so Kraugel was convinced that it was accurate. He trusted his understanding of the game.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘And now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel calculated that Piaro should be level 385~386.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the conclusion he came to after studying the experience values required to level up and the growth rate of named NPCs.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, what was Kraugel’s level?</span></p>
 <p><span style>326.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There are 60 levels between us.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It meant he dealt 30% less damage and would receive 30% more damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a big penalty, considering there was such a big difference in the basic stats of normal classes and legendary classes.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Kraugel didn’t shrink back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The odds are good enough.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel had maintained the 1st ranking since Satisfy opened.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the first in all types of fields, gobbling up achievements and titles.&nbsp;</span><span style>This could cover the gap in level and class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Also.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro’s farming technique was based on the sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Plow, sickle, hand plow, flail etc.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was unusual since farming equipment were used as weapons, but it was still in the form of swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is ideal to use swordsmanship with a sword.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Using swordsmanship with farming equipment?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was meaningless and the only fatal weakness of the ‘farmer’ Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the decisive reason why Kraugel thought he had a chance of winning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I only have to be careful of the instant kill skill.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Fated to Perish, which logged Zibal out in a single blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can’t allow him to use it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The recent broadcast of ‘Polishing’ had caused a stir, but Kraugel felt more appreciation for ‘Fated to Perish.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Clink.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel took out White Fang.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the legendary sword that he acquired from one of the great demons Drasion, who was defeated by Sword Saint Muller.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Can you give me a chance to attack first?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a duel, attacking first was important. It was a means of ensuring a definite advantage for a short time.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Kraugel was asking Piaro to concede something.&nbsp;</span><span style>He weighed up all the penalties and decided that this advantage wasn’t too much to ask for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Piaro should reject.&nbsp;</span><span style>But who was Piaro?&nbsp;</span><span style>He was a person who had always been called the strongest. He showed off a confident figure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll accept.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as Kraugel expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro gave Kraugel a chance to win and Kraugel had no intention of missing it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The opponent is a legend. The difference in stamina is overwhelming, so it will become disadvantageous to me in the long run. I have to finish it quickly.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was a time when the sun was shining overhead.&nbsp;</span><span style>Under intense sunlight or moonlight, this footwork gave off a stealth function around Kraugel’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style>White Light Steps.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past, Piaro hadn’t been able to see through Kraugel’s stealth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now he was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was quick to respond to Kraugel’s movements, blocking White Fang that aimed for his left side.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>'Indeed, the gap in level is too big.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The stealth was useless.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he couldn’t lean on White Light Steps, his odds would fall by 1%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is still within the permitted range.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel was still calm.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wasn’t shaken even when faced with the worst situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the attitude of someone at the top.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Piaro blocked White Fang with a hand plow in his left hand and wielded a sickle with his right hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a diagonal attack.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was fast enough to exceed Kraugel’s predicted range.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could Piaro’s agility be far beyond the assumed level?&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel was surprised, but he responded without making a mistake.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Chaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In a 0.1 second gap, Kraugel avoided Piaro’s strike and counterattacked.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t need to go through a process of decision making to respond. He used his experience and reflexes developed from countless battles. Of course, the help of ‘Keen Senses’ was also great.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel let out a groan.&nbsp;</span><span style>He blocked the hand plow and sickle with White Fang, but was baffled by the strength behind them.&nbsp;</span><span style>A normal person would’ve felt sure of their defeat the moment they felt this gap in strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Kraugel saw an opportunity in the crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tearing the Sky.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwajak!</span></i> <i><span style>Kwajajajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>One of the ultimate skills of a White Swordsman was revealed.&nbsp;</span><span style>A beast’s claws clashed with Piaro’s equipment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There was a slight crack in the hand plow and sickle as blood flowed from Piaro’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The equipment that My Lord made...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro was startled. He couldn’t help being surprised that the farming equipment made by a legendary blacksmith was damaged by the blow.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Kraugel was even more surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There wasn’t a lot of damage?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The damage formula for Tearing the Sky was difficult to calculate because it was utilized as a counterattack and the orbit was limited, while also taking into account the user’s attack power + attack power of the enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel had predicted that Piaro would receive at least 40,000 damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the damage was only 7,000, making Kraugel realize.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Piaro must be over level 400.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was bad.&nbsp;</span><span style>The level difference was too large for the damage formula to be properly applied. The fourth stats awakening was a wall that couldn’t be overcome by the effects of different titles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How? How did Brother grow so quickly?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel didn’t know it, but this was all due to Chris, other high level players, and Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel didn’t know that Piaro was constantly turning high level rankers who visited Reidan into farmers and training them, as well as achieving rapid growth through his spar with Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a pity.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Swaeek!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel was hit by a flail while trying to regain his composure.&nbsp;</span><span style>His eyes widened as he was about to read the orbit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It isn’t swordsmanship?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro had changed from swordsmanship to farming techniques. It was an entirely new form.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the moment when the strength of ‘Sword Saint Candidate’ Kraugel to see through numerous swordsmanship techniques was neutralized.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeeeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel wasn’t able to react and was hit hard, causing his shoulders to shake. The right arm holding White Fang fell into a paralysis state.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro read this and thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Counterattacking is impossible.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel would absolutely take an evasive action. It was likely to be the footwork called White Light Steps.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro determined this and swung the flail.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Far from Kraugel avoiding it, he clung to Piaro. It was an approach that applied a footwork different to the White Light Steps.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel used brilliant footwork to come close, making it difficult for Piaro to attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the precursor of ‘Hwimori.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peok!</span></i> <i><span style>Pepeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel was able to reach the East Continent with the help of the sage, Sticks.&nbsp;</span><span style>Before he changed to a white swordsman, he explored the place that imitated the culture of the east and reproduced the fast and odd footwork of someone he met.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro felt like he was possessed by a ghost as he was kicked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s just a tickle!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro had been hit by Tearing the Sky, so the kick couldn’t do much damage to him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro accepted all of Kraugel’s kicks, but he was fine.&nbsp;</span><span style>He pushed Kraugel with his shoulder, withdrew the flail that stretched forward, while at the same time, taking out a plow with his other hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Free Farming 4th Style, Plowing the Field.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sururuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel stumbled and the ground around him was cleared in an instant.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro was about to sow seeds when he stopped.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was due to the storm caused by Hwimori.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk.</span></i> <i><span style>Puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puuoooook!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The kicks were fast and light, but were weak.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro’s body seemed to be affected by the technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro coughed out black blood.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this point, Kraugel overcame the paralysis in his right hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Storm Sword.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The light blade tore Piaro’s old clothes to shreds.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro’s health gauge was decreasing little by little as he allowed successive attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, he wasn’t upset at all. Rather, his momentum increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Fun!!!!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel had a different type of power from Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the first time in ages that an opponent made Piaro so excited.&nbsp;</span><span style>The excited Piaro dug at a vein of water.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A pillar of water shot up and crashed into Kraugel’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro linked Sowing and Rapid Growth together.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwarururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘Legendary skills...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel paled as he witnessed the thorns growing rapidly in the field.&nbsp;</span><span style>He escaped through the air with White Light Steps and restored the posture of White Fang.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the manifestation of ‘Meteor Sword.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The whole area was scorched.&nbsp;</span><span style>The meteor blades that feel from Kraugel’s sword went through the thorny vines.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the center of the field, Kraugel’s White Fang and Piaro’s hand plow collided head on.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Blocking Meteor Sword...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the composed Kraugel couldn’t stay calm. He launched a nervous onslaught, causing a thunderous sound to ring out every time it was stopped by Piaro’s farming equipment.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro was amazed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He has already penetrated through my farming techniques!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel’s vision surpassed Piaro’s.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel subsequently crushed the seven farming tools used by Piaro, increasing the number of wounds on Piaro’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was based on pure control ability and battle senses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But his level was a problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro still had more than two-thirds of his health left despite allowing successive attacks, while Kraugel avoided most attacks but his health fell to less than half. His movements were relatively high compared to Piaro, so he was consuming stamina quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘White Light Sword isn’t a match.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>After blinding the opponent, he could link his top skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Piaro was a legend and immune to status conditions. It meant that the opponent was someone he couldn’t unleash 100% of the white swordsman’s power against.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>'No, those are all excuses.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had encountered numerous opponents immune to CC and he had beaten them all. He always overcame his lacking areas with his control.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, his skills weren’t prevailing against Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment that Kraugel thought this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess I should use all my power.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro barely escaped from a nasty wound, spoke meaningful words and used Natural State.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the same time, his amplified stats overturned the situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Kraugel was the one allowing attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro’s speed and power, enhanced by Natural State, started to overwhelm Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Most of his health was lost in an instant, causing Kraugel’s eyes to flash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Super Sensitivity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Super Sensitivity has been used.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[100% of your mana has been consumed.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[For the next six seconds, all senses transcend cognition.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Agility is increased by 20% and you can 100% predict the behavior of all objects within 10 meters.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This will be exhausted in six seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel’s strength wasn’t due to skills or title effects. Kraugel himself had natural abilities.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment Super Sensitivity was used, Kraugel was reborn.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was enough to overcome Piaro’s enhanced speed and deal a deadly blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was an unfamiliar experience to Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was it because he received a deadly wound?&nbsp;</span><span style>No, this wasn’t something new.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro was always injured when he fought.&nbsp;</span><span style>The problem was his instincts.&nbsp;</span><span style>His instincts were shouting that it was dangerous. It warned him not to confront Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Does it want me to run away?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro’s fighting spirit peaked.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment he lost his dignity as the strongest person, he showed a technique that he didn’t use against Grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Free Farming Peak Style!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel entered the transcendent realm thanks to Super Sensitivity.&nbsp;</span><span style>He tried to escape the moment Piaro spoke with a serious look on his face.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because he perceived the danger that couldn’t be resisted.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, it was already too late.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Pounding Mortar!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwaaaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was a disaster.&nbsp;</span><span style>Something fell from the sky and dug into the ground, like a mortar.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the same time, Reidan shook. It was like a great earthquake.</span></p>
