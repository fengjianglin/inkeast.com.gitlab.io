 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘The two of them have good chemistry.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro was a person who liked to teach others. There was no one in the Tzedakah Guild who hadn’t been taught by Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>Royman also dreamed of reaching a higher ground, so if they stuck together, they could become a fantasy pair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Please don’t lean towards becoming a farmer.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>The unique rated Mass Production Grid set.&nbsp;</span><span style>It had a 160 level limit and had significant value. In particular, it was suitable for people who wanted to grow rapidly.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an investment, so Grid wanted Royman to achieve a growth beyond his expectations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Duke, we’ll return to the north.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The road to the castle.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Steim’s knights came and spoke to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My father-in-law?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was puzzled because he didn’t see Marquis Steim and Laden explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The lord wants to stay near the young nobleman. We have to protect him, but the north is currently slightly unstable. It can’t be left empty, so we’ll return first. I ask you to please look after My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don’t care what you say, but isn’t the situation in the north unstable? Is it okay for Father-in-law to leave his position?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We will go first so that it will be okay, even if My Lord isn’t there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Father-in-law has many good subordinates.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Okay, I understand. I will look after Father-in-law, so please go. If you’re having a hard time in the north, go to Jude in Winston. He doesn’t have any thoughts, but he has great strength, unlike a braggart like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...I will listen. I am grateful for your care.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laden and the knights respectfully said goodbye and left Reidan. It was with 1,000 soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style>500 elites were left behind to protect Marquis Steim.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Vacating his territory because of his grandchild. He had no dignity as a marquis.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid said so, but he fully understood Marquis Steim’s mind.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lord was cute, smart and pretty!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord, wait! Father is coming!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid hastened his pace.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to see his son’s face as soon as possible.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel gazed at Grid as he entered in a hurry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you know that your work efficiency has been very poor since Lord was born?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid knew.&nbsp;</span><span style>Every day, he had played with Lord for at least two hours, so he had a tendency to neglect item making and hunting.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel grinned at Grid, who couldn’t speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Well, your current look is very good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was confused since he thought he would be scolded again.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel gazed at him carefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It is right to get used to loving someone. You will learn to be generous through this.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was fundamentally a simple and narrow-minded person.&nbsp;</span><span style>What was the reason?&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel could roughly guess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is because he has been despised most of his life by others.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grd had a low self-esteem and was narrow-minded compared to his ability. He wasn’t good at interacting with others.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Lauel listened to the Tzedakah Guild, Grid was much worse in the past. He only thought about himself and was always jealous of others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Grid started changing, and at the center of this change were Irene and Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Receiving love and giving love. Grid became more mature because he experienced one of the basic principles of human relations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You will eventually rule over millions of people and receive a lifetime of taxes from them. To become a good and wise king, you must learn compassion first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Grid was a normal user, he would’ve responded incredulously.&nbsp;</span><span style>Love? Charity? Good and wise king?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Are you shooting a movie alone? This is just a game,’ was what they would say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Grid was different from a common user.&nbsp;</span><span style>Satisfy wasn’t a simple game for Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a world that was a precious as reality, where he got wealth, friends, a lover and a child.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I understand what you’re trying to say. But isn’t it better to think of the people first instead of me? We can’t even raise the taxes, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It will be fine as long as I coordinate with you. As you know, I have the qualities of a tyrant like you. The two of us complement each other.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qualities of a tyrant... Two of us...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid shivered.&nbsp;</span><span style>He struggled to shake off this feeling.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Reidan’s desert was full of heat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were powerful and wild monsters here, as Prince Ren was well aware.&nbsp;</span><span style>Nevertheless, the reason why he marched his army without any hesitation was because he had a countermeasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That way."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beyond there as well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Royal Knights Captain, Chucksley.&nbsp;</span><span style>The best archer in the palace, Ferrell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two people, known as the strongest men, were leading a handful of troops. Their mission was to eliminate the monsters on the way.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was possible because the royal monster scholars displayed the location of the desert monsters on the map.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s easy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The squads scattered in all directions around their base, defeating monsters. This allowed the base to safely advance.&nbsp;</span><span style>While this progressed smoothly, the smiling Ren gave orders to 20 assassins.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Head to Reidan first. If the war begins and there’s a gap in Reidan’s defenses, grab the duchess and bring her to me. Alternatively, you can also kill her."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The assassins moved quickly.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ren confirmed this and gained greater confidence, speeding up his march.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry! We have to arrive at Reidan tomorrow to match up with Hurent’s schedule!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ohhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldiers’ morale increased.&nbsp;</span><span style>The heat of the desert?&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t an obstacle for a person who would soon become king.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"What’s this?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The northern knight leading 1,000 soldiers across the desert.&nbsp;</span><span style>He looked up at the high sand dune and stopped the march.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tadat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Laden climbed up the sand dune. The soldiers admired his slick movements.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the sight of thousands of soldiers appeared before him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That flag is...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laden’s expression stiffened.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a silver dragon with wings.&nbsp;</span><span style>It represented the royal family of the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why are royal troops here in the west?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The royal army was advancing towards Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is it to celebrate the young lord’s birth?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the scale of the march was too big.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It can’t be!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>1st Prince Ren hated Duke Grid. No, strictly speaking, he was afraid of the duke.&nbsp;</span><span style>A rat cornered by a cat would act!&nbsp;</span><span style>Marquis Steim was concerned that Prince Ren would act against Grid after King Wiesbaden died.&nbsp;</span><span style>Therefore, he wanted to mediate between Prince Ren and Grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘My Lord’s efforts have been ruined.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that King Wiesbaden was dying.&nbsp;</span><span style>It happened when Laden was thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why are northern troops here in the west?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He heard someone’s voice behind him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Laden turned and saw 300 people on horseback.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were one of the squads hunting monsters.&nbsp;</span><span style>The elite royal cavalry, the Iron Wind.&nbsp;</span><span style>The leader of the Iron Wind, Beida, was famous for being a master of two spears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I asked why northern troops are here in the west.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beida approached and asked again.&nbsp;</span><span style>There weren’t any hostile intentions and they were from the same kingdom, so the northern soldiers didn’t bother him.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Laden was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Get down!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laden shouted to the soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style>The spear flew over the heads of the soldiers who had reflexively ducked.&nbsp;</span><span style>The spear was swung by Beida.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"H-Hik!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldiers who survived peed themselves. The few people who were unable to escape had their heads separated from their bodies, causing the entire northern army to turn white.&nbsp;</span><span style>Beida’s gaze fell on Laden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have very good eyes. What is your name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You keep asking questions. You’re like a coquettish woman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laden’s attitude that showed no fear stimulated Beida.&nbsp;</span><span style>He slowly revealed the wild nature that was hidden under his calm expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You...! I will cut off your arms and legs first before asking again. Hiyah!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beida ran forward.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a speed beyond common sense as he rushed through the desert hills.&nbsp;</span><span style>The northern troops were frightened, but Laden remained calm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The sin of killing Marquis Steim’s soldiers, I will pay it back with death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laden placed a hand on the sheathe at his waist and watched Beida.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You are still wet behind the eyes!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Beida’s spear stuck in the sand.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the place where Laden had been standing just a moment ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>Laden avoided the spear and swung his sword at Beida’s thigh.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Beida defended with his spear and declared angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You are fast but not very strong... Kuk?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beida paled as he realized it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Blood was rising from the wrist that held the spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Phoenix wasn’t the only strong one in the north?&nbsp;</span><span style>Laden knocked down the astonished Beida and commanded the northern troops.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kill all of them and return to Reidan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Until yesterday, they were serving the same king.&nbsp;</span><span style>Laden believed that Marquis Steim would be on Duke Grid’s side, rather than Prince Ren, and quickly knew what to do.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘It won’t be long now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent’s mood was heightened as he descended towards the foot of the mountain.&nbsp;</span><span style>His blood boiled as he thought of paying back the 5 second humiliation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will show you the true power of aura.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The biggest advantages of aura were the fixed damage and form changes.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the time of the National Competition, Hurent couldn’t properly make use of the form changes, but now it was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a power that made imagination become reality.&nbsp;</span><span style>With this fraudulent power, Hurent believed that he could defeat Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>No, it wasn’t just Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It included Kraugel, the top rankers, Agnus and the hidden rankers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent had no doubt that he would overwhelm all of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It happened when Hurent and the 2,000 troops had just left Altes Mountains and were about to enter the desert.&nbsp;</span><span style>Two farmers blocked their path.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent was upset and fired aura at them.&nbsp;</span><span style>The farmers’ eyes widened as they saw the aura stretching like a whip.</span></p>
