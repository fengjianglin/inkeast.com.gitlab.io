 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>What was the terrible plan that the Japanese right wing forces set up?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We will kill Damian. Let’s show him the taste of fear and despair, so that he won’t talk about Grid again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We will tame him and use him to thoroughly strengthen the forces of the Japanese guilds.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s support the rankers who will participate in the next National Competition. If there are 10 Rebecca healers per ranker, who would be able to beat them in the National Competition?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the name of patriotism, they were trying to use force to dominate someone else’s life.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a complete human rights violation and a terrifying idea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I want to step on Grid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>That thought was on their minds.&nbsp;</span><span style>The right wing Japanese forces had no intention of touching Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Seven Guilds didn’t have the power to threaten Grid, so they couldn’t even if they wanted to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were weak to the strong, and strong against the weak.&nbsp;</span><span style>Just like the mass protests against Korean and the small anti-Chinese protests, the Japanese extreme right wing forces chose the path they believed was wise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was the fundamental problem, but they turned away from him and aimed the arrow at the relatively weaker Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style>But they overlooked one thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian was never weak.&nbsp;</span><span style>He might’ve been acting as an informal ranker for nearly a year, but he was originally a high ranker. He was also the first person to obtain a unique hidden class. Now he had become the pope.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was definitely one of the strongest people.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, when compared to Grid...</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was always interested in international affairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Collecting a wide range of information while playing Satisfy was a basic skill, and knowing the issues of each country was a great help when it came to gathering information.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was early in the morning.&nbsp;</span><span style>Prior to accessing Satisfy, Lauel was looking at the overseas topics and was baffled when looking at the news from Japan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Pope Damian! He announced that he would build a Goddess Rebecca temple in Reidan!!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This person...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel’s expression twisted.&nbsp;</span><span style>Didn’t he advise him several times that the cooperative relationship between Overgeared and the Rebecca Church should proceed discreetly?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, during Damian’s campaign, Grid and Huroi had acted as carefully as possible. They tried to help Damian’s campaign while avoiding people’s attention.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the day of the pope speech candidates, they accidentally appeared on air, but there was no doubt that they were trying their best.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now Damian was turning all their hard work to naught.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Stop worshipping Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more influential religions were, the less biased they should be. They had to maintain a neutral position and treat everyone equally. It was because certain powers might collude with others to weaken the power of the religion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel immediately connected to Satisfy and whispered to Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Why are you ignoring my advice?</span></i> <i><span style>How many times have I told you that you must keep your help towards Grid and Overgeared a secret?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>It couldn’t be helped.</span></i> <i><span style>It’s hard to maintain a neutral position forever because I’m receiving too much pressure inside and outside of the game.</span></i> <i><span style>I had to make a choice.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Inside the game?</span></i> <i><span style>Apart from the Japanese extreme right wing groups, there is another force putting pressure on you?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Yes, the Saharan Empire is trying to take the Rebecca Church as a state religion.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel’s expression stiffened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Saharan Empire, based on a nationalist ideology, was trying to make the largest religion on the continent its state religion?&nbsp;</span><span style>The aftermath would be enormous. It would be prohibited to serve Goddess Rebecca unless they were part of the empire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Saharan Empire was already the greatest power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>There were a total of 17 nations on the continent, but it wasn’t an exaggeration to say that all of them were under the rule of the empire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The Saharan Empire...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They grew arrogant, as there were no enemies in the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I was going to hand the Rebecca Church over to you, I wouldn’t have made Damian the pope.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cynical Lauel laid out a map of the West Continent. Then he examined several kingdoms that bordered the Saharan Empire.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Thorny Vine Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was one of the roads connected Reidan and the Saharan Empire, and was the place where the legend of Faker, the god of death, began.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t this where the Ice Flower Guild was wiped out by Faker?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you believe that ridiculous rumour? The Ice Flower Guild is one of the strongest guilds, and part of the Seven Guilds. How could they be wiped out by Faker?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right. Bondre alone would be able to take care of Faker.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid just spread an exaggerated rumor in order to increase the reputation of Overgeared. It’s just a bluff.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Japan’s leading right wing guild, the 180 players of Sakura, were hiding in the forest.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their goal was Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their first task was to kidnap and detain the traitor who was heading for Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We can wait around here. We’ll make that traitor pay for betraying his country.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Building a temple in Grid’s damn territory, he must be a Zainichi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Whoa whoa, suppress your killing intent. We can’t kill the person who will become our puppet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sakura Guild members gritted their teeth.&nbsp;</span><span style>After a while, they witnessed a long procession entering the forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Happy-chan~ isn’t it difficult? Do you want me to do it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Your Holiness, please maintain your dignity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don’t care about my dignity if it means ignoring girls who are having a hard time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now~ Happy-chan, come on. Yes? Are you shy? You are completely cute. I want to pat your head like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kyaaak! Your Holiness! Don’t use too much strength!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sakura Guild members frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pope Damian was part of a procession with 200 young girls?&nbsp;</span><span style>They heard he was an otaku, but they didn’t know he was a lolicon as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He’s enjoying this world properly after becoming pope.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Bringing his harem girls on a journey...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is he the emperor of the Lorije Empire?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kkirik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yoshimura, the master of the Sakura Guild, pulled back his bowstring.&nbsp;</span><span style>The bow of the person who was once the 2nd ranked archer was aimed exactly at Damian’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First, eat this!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Piing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A quick shot was fired.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yoshimura might’ve fallen to 4th place on the archer rankings, but it was rare to see someone with such a good bow skill in the world.&nbsp;</span><span style>The arrow quickly broke through the gap in thorns and precisely struck at Damian’s heart...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...This is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yoshimura was astonished.&nbsp;</span><span style>The 200 beautiful girls in white clothing who were following Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style>The young girls aged from 10 to 15 years old instantly brought out spears, swords, and shields, and blocked Yoshimura’s arrow?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Reading the arrow’s position and even blocking it? An arrow shot by Yoshimura?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘These kids are freely swinging a blade bigger than their bodies?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The speed at which they take their formation is like well-trained soldiers!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sakura Guild members couldn’t believe the sight that was happening in front of them.&nbsp;</span><span style>They wondered how little girls could show such great talents and agile movements. It didn’t make sense. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deep in the quiet forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sakura members’ mouths gaped open as they hid, while the beautiful girls looked around the forest while holding weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian stood in the center and gave a meaningful smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Trying to fight the Rebecca’s Daughters candidates, how foolish.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eyes of the Sakura Guild members shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Rebecca’s Daughters candidates!’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Rebecca Church only chose girls who were born with divine ability and talents, secretly training them to be the strongest paladins who could handle the three divine artifacts.&nbsp;</span><span style>And the name of the strongest paladins were called ‘Rebecca’s Daughters.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>These girls were the candidates?</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Shit! Aren’t the candidates secretly fostered in a secret temple of the Rebecca Church? Why are they accompanying Damian?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘These young girls are unbelievably strong...!'</span></p>
 <p><span style>The confused Sakura Guild members were about to turn back after realizing the situation, when...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Goddess’ Eyes.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A golden light concentrated on Damian’s fingertips and spread out all over the place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The pope receives Goddess Rebecca’s blessing.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Goddess Rebecca detects all living things within 300m of you. Undead and the demonkin will receive great damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are exactly 180 people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian’s eyes sank coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want blood covering the fine hands of these girls. I will do it myself. Goddess’ Blessing.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pa pa pa pa pak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was truly spectacular.&nbsp;</span><span style>More than 200 green lights streaked through the dark forest, falling from the sky and hitting Damian and the girls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Goddess’ Blessing increases you and your party members’ stats by 10% for 5 minutes, negates one strike and will create a shield that absorbs 8,000 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ack...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sakura Guild watching Damian frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was due to the intensity of the green light that wrapped around Damian and the girls that made them shine.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian gazed towards the location where most of them were gathered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Goddess’ Wrath.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chiiiiiing!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Two huge magic circles, around 3m in diameter, were quickly created behind Damian’s back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What’s that?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sakura Guild couldn’t get a sense of Damian’s actions.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was natural.&nbsp;</span><span style>Among the users, only Grid would recognize the pope’s skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian’s declaration was a signal.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwaaaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was like watching an anti-tank gun.&nbsp;</span><span style>Two huge rays were fired from the magic circles created behind Damian’s back, moving in a straight line that swallowed everything in its path.&nbsp;</span><span style>Half of the forest was destroyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Party member Gigs has suffered 14,100 damage!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Party member Kinji has suffered 15,500 damage!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Party member Rokman has suffered 14,990 damage!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Party member Yoshimura has suffered 12,100 damage!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Party member Orochi has suffered 9,900 damage!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Party member...]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Party...]</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is ridiculous!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The faces of the Sakura Guild members turned white.&nbsp;</span><span style>It only took a few seconds to cast a large area skill that inflicted huge damage to dozens of guild members that were at least level 210?&nbsp;</span><span style>This was a complete scam!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How...? How can a user be so strong? This is ridiculous! It’s unbalanced!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian just laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The pope’s tenure is limited to one year, so shouldn’t I be able to exercise this much power? Your level is just too low.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eek! We would be able to win if you weren’t the pope!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I know that I’m the pope, but you’re stupid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t know a pope was so strong! Shit! Damn! If you were weak, we would be able to easily take care of you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Truly unscrupulous guys.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian sighed and pulled out a sword. Then he threw off his white clothing, revealing golden armor.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘I love Isabel-chan, Rin-chan and Luna-chan’ was beautifully engraved on the armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don’t need to use the pope’s power on you.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Damian rushed towards Yoshimura, the master of the Sakura Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yoshimura calmly fired an arrow, despite being surprised at the paladin’s speed.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a strong blow, but the arrow was offset by the shield of light around Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s just this much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Great skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian showed a high level of swordsmanship that Yoshimura couldn’t escape with his agility, leaving him wounded.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was far beyond the range that the Yoshimura Guild estimated for the first unique hidden class and the pope.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian might look silly because he was an otaku, but his ability was actually really great.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, when compared with Grid...</span></p>
