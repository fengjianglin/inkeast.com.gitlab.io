 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The sanctum of the Judar Church wasn’t far from the Dominion Church. If a shortcut was used, they could arrive within three days.&nbsp;</span><span style>But few people used the shortcut. Almost everyone used the main road, even if it took double the amount of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason was simple. The habitat of the griffons existed on the shortest route. A moment of distraction meant a person could be surrounded by dozens of griffons.&nbsp;</span><span style>Nearby lords adopted the punishment of leaving convicted criminals in the griffon habitat, and those who visited such a dangerous place were extremely rare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But right now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>A young Asian man and a black person were walking into the griffon habitat, like moths flying into a fire.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were Grid and Toban.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Toban, what are you doing? I’m bored.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban, who was tensely spying on the griffon’s habitat, blocked the mouth of the yawning Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He started sweating as he said,&nbsp;</span><span style>“How many times do I have to tell you? Do you want to die after being discovered by the griffons because of your loud noises?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The griffons were level 260.&nbsp;</span><span style>With strong wings and high stamina, they were able to strike from the sky and capture their prey. Due to this, they were one of the top predators amongst the field monsters.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even high level rankers wouldn’t be able to fight back when ambushed by a group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s why Toban was cautious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Please be quiet and follow me. I've used this path dozens of times. If you act as I say, we can safely pass through this canyon without seeing any griffons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Minimize the sound of your breathing as much as possible and move in a crawl. Okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban confidently lay on the ground and took a crawling position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid watched him silently before frowning,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Isn’t your tone too annoying? Are you trying to teach me? Huh? A slave doesn’t fear his master?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban realized his mistake and clarified.&nbsp;</span><span style>“A-Ah, Grid. Don’t be angry. I just wanted to advise you...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How annoying. I’m not listening to you. Crawling? Are you crazy? Didn’t I do it enough as a soldier?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>South Korea had yet to unify with North Korea. It was well over 100 years of truce, but North Korea’s provocations still continued. In order to defend the country from North Korea, the strong young males of South Korea had compulsory military service, and it was the same for Grid as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you been to the military? Do you know crawling?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The military...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban was born in the United States. He had no interest in military service, so he didn’t have many experiences meeting a soldier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid clicked his tongue.&nbsp;</span><span style>“A guy who never entered the military is talking about crawling... Hey, you civilian. I was part of the South Korean army and I’m still a reservist. Do you know how much I suffered while crawling during training? I still tremble when thinking of that time. But now I have to crawl in a game? Furthermore, it is with someone who doesn’t even know how to crawl?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban was overwhelmed by Grid’s words and couldn’t refute them. How could he know that the act of crawling would upset a soldier? He stood there blankly after realizing it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A person with no concept of crawling...”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid grumbled before pulling something out of his inventory. It was a scruffy looking cloak.&nbsp;</span><span style>Malacus’ Cloak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban panicked,&nbsp;</span><span style>“H-Hey, Grid! Are you crazy? Why are you bringing that out? I told you a few times to keep it in your inventory!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban was one of the members who participated in the Malacus raid. He was well aware of the option that Malacus’ Cloak had.&nbsp;</span><span style>The bloody smell from the cloak was enough to stimulate the hundreds of griffons inhabiting the high cliffs!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re committing suicide!”&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban imagined the scene of griffons flocking after smelling the blood and paled.&nbsp;</span><span style>“What? Quickly put the cloak back in your inventory!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid looked at the panicked Toban and ridiculed,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Why do you think I selected the shortcut? Was it just to shorten the time? No, that wasn’t it. In the first place, my purpose is to hunt griffons. I can’t overlook the griffon habitat here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Griffon bones, leather and tendons were used extensively in item production.&nbsp;</span><span style>Weren’t griffon tendons one of the main ingredients in the Gale Spear?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had decided to hunt griffons, since Pon said that he paid a large amount of money to purchase the griffon tendons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now it was the right opportunity.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were no areas with griffons in the vicinity of Winston.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t let go of the griffon habitat that was here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will get everything from the griffons today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Crazy bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? What did you just say?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid glared at Toban angrily. But Toban didn’t shrink back. The griffons were scarier than Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I now know that Grid is incredibly strong! Your abilities can be compared with the top 10 users!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, is it that much?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was happy about the praise, but he also scratched his nose from embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The agitated Toban made closer to Grid and spat in his face as he shouted,&nbsp;</span><span style>“But that isn’t enough! The number of griffons here are immeasurable! Making a disturbance will make us be surrounded by hundreds of griffons. Even the 1st ranked Kraugel wouldn’t be able to kill all the griffons by himself! But you want to hunt the griffons while wearing Malacus’ Cloak? Put it away now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“U-Umm...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Certainly, the griffons were hard monsters to hunt. Weren’t they level 260?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid used the benefit of hindsight and placed Malacus’ Cloak in the inventory.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he said to Toban.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Okay, I understand. I’ll give up on group hunting. Instead, let’s defeat as many as possible. We will go and hunt the griffons one by one. Understood?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was determined to hunt griffons.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thus, Toban was forced to give in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, if it’s one at a time... It will take some time, but it’s good enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, Toban also wanted the experience and loot that came from hunting griffons.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment that Toban decided to hunt griffons with Grid...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kieeeeek!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A little while ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The problem was Toban’s agitated shouting.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dozens of griffons were gathering after hearing his voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keok...”&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban found the crowd of griffons in the sky and flopped down.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Damn...! It is over! We will die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid snorted,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Stop talking nonsense. How can I die in a place like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In no time, Grid was equipped with shining white armor, gloves and a silver crown. There was also a black greatsword in his right hand.&nbsp;</span><span style>The spectacular and dignified figure gave hope to Toban.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘That's right... Grid is strong!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had singlehandedly defeated Asuka, Black Teddy, Box and Toban in a fight.&nbsp;</span><span style>His level might be low but he was one of the strongest users due to his legendary class. Toban believed that it might be possible to win against the griffons with Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid! Give me a command!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had already agreed to be a slave and he would do his duty as a slave!&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban was fully prepared to take Grid’s directions.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid threw Malacus’ Cloak at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First of all, put that on. Then run away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban couldn’t figure out Grid’s intentions.&nbsp;</span><span style>Run away with Malacus’ Cloak?&nbsp;</span><span style>If he put on Malacus’ Cloak, wouldn’t he become the target of the griffons? Why would he wear Malacus’ Cloak when he was trying to run away?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid cried out with frustration,&nbsp;</span><span style>“You still don’t understand? You are bait!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Bait?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban doubted his ears.&nbsp;</span><span style>A human, a species that had the best intellect on the planet, was being used as bait for a monster?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you serious?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid replied impatiently to Toban,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Do I sound like I’m joking? This is a command.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No way! Acting as a bait for monsters, it is against human rights! It is not ethical!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What does ethics have to do with this? What right does a slave have to talk about civil rights? We can get rid of this crisis if you act as bait, while I handle them one by one from the rear!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was true. Fighting with dozens of griffons meant it was likely both of them would die.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban felt like crying.&nbsp;</span><span style>A few days ago, he had been glad about receiving a SS-grade quest for the first time, but it was different now. This wasn’t a quest from a god, it was a curse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jeurereuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Recently, the number of times Toban wanted to cry had increased significantly. He eventually equipped Malacus’ Cloak. The bloody smell spread in every direction and the griffons’ attention concentrated on Toban.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kyaooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The griffons who were just as violent as orcs. They were excited by this delicious smell. The sharp beaks aimed exactly at Toban’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hiik!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban defended with his shield.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There was a big impact and Toban’s body was pushed back a few steps. In this gap, a griffon flapped its huge wings, creating wind pressure, and wielded heavy paws.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh? Ehhhh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban stumbled from the wind pressure. The griffon’s paw aimed for his chest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to the wind pressure, Toban couldn’t even adjust his shield. It meant he was hit by the griffon’s paw and couldn’t avoid a serious injury.&nbsp;</span><span style>No, why was this griffon so strong?&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban felt some doubts and checked the griffon’s name. Then he cursed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dammit! This bastard is a field boss?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right. The griffon leading 22 griffons was a level 290 field boss name ‘Griffon Captain.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why has God forsaken me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban screamed. But after the unavoidable blow, he immediately drank a &nbsp;health potion and used buff magic that concentrated on defense. Then he closed his eyes and prepared for the pain.&nbsp;</span><span style>At that moment, Grid appeared behind the Griffon Captain and aimed Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Kill at the perfect gap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Holy Light Gloves option effect is activated, causing you to attack the target five times.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The damage of level 1 kill was 1500% of his attack power, while the level 2 damage was 1800%.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid also invested the 200 points earned from the pope into strength as always. In addition, the pavranium was blessed by God Dominion and had a damage enhancement effect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>That wasn’t all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, 23 griffons were recognized by Dainsleif as enemies. The additional 345 attack power from this, as well as the effect of Blacksmith’s Rage and the 1800% damage was sufficient to threaten the boss monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then there was a critical and the option from the Holy Light Gloves.&nbsp;</span><span style>The amount of damage applied transcended common sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 284,000 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Didn’t the pope only have around 300,000 health?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was surprised to see the notification window.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kyaooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A single blow.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Griffon Captain suffered tremendous damage from one blow and dropped heavily. It collapsed. It fell into a critical condition.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban’s mouth gaped open as he asked Grid,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Grid... What is this tremendous attack power? Don’t tell me you didn’t exert all your skills in the fight against Box’s group?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maybe a legendary class was greater than he expected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid calmly replied to Toban.&nbsp;</span><span style>"It's not like that. This is pure luck.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was even more surprised than Toban.</span></p>
