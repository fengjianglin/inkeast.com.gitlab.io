 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>At the time of the pope candidates episode.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid got a great chance to study Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style>He repeatedly disassembled and reassembled a myth rated item and raised his understanding to 100%. This was valuable research that couldn’t be converted into money.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a dream that other blacksmiths couldn’t even hope for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Cry, Yakult."</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t difficult for Grid to raise his understanding of Iyarugt, which was still only unique rated. It was very easy compared to understanding Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was now able to control Iyarugt without resorting to Blackening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the renaming failed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Iyarugt is the best sword of hell! You, don’t replace my noble name just because you find it hard to pronounce!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iyarugt had tremendous pride in his name.&nbsp;</span><span style>He followed Grid, but he couldn’t accept a new name. He didn’t know what it meant, but he felt an instinctive rejection towards Yakult.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t care.&nbsp;</span><span style>The sword would obey his command, no matter what name he called it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Iyarugt has used Blood Cry.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[All targets within a 30m radius will lose their sense of balance for 1.5 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kiiing...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood Cry didn’t distinguish between friend or foe.&nbsp;</span><span style>The northern troops and royal army around Grid all groaned with pain and stumbled.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the same for Prince Ren and his escort knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Making me fall to my knees!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Ren was the heir of the Eternal Kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style>As the 1st Prince, he had never bowed to anyone except the king.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid used a skill to make him kneel for a while.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was really terrible. His ego was shattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amazement appeared on Prince Ren’s face as he looked up.&nbsp;</span><span style>He looked around and saw that knights and soldiers on both sides were all kneeling together. Even Chucksley seemed on the brink of collapse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person who was standing in this spot?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was only Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an absurd appearance where he overpowered everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is the strength of a legend...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He truly was a fearful enemy. If possible, he never wanted to go against Grid. However, he was a mountain that must be overcome if Ren wanted to become king.&nbsp;</span><span style>While Prince Ren was shivering, Grid was baffled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You endured it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood Cry consumed a lot of mana and had a long cooldown time. It was also dangerous because it didn’t distinguish between enemies.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a great way to exert his power, but Chucksley was relatively stable.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had resistance comparable to a boss monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I won’t fall from something like this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chucksley demonstrated an extreme mental strength as he overcame Blood Cry and defended against Grid’s attack, then he fought back.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a simple trajectory.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to the Iyarugt, Grid was able to respond without much difficulty.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Chucksley and Iyarugt collided in an impressive manner and dust flew all over the place.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an ignorant attack.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid and Chucksley exchanged looks through the dust.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unlike the composed Chucksley, Grid didn’t look very good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was confused because the opponent was exceedingly stronger than he expected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is this guy?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had high status resistance and his swordsmanship was odd.&nbsp;</span><span style>His technique seemed simple, but it was strong when actually facing it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is the first time.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s surroundings were filled with geniuses. Except for Grid, even Jude could be considered a genius in certain areas.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, there were the sword geniuses, Piaro and Ibellin.&nbsp;</span><span style>What did they have in common?</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were the masters of anomalies.&nbsp;</span><span style>They used unconventional swordsmanship to confuse and overwhelm their opponent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then what about Chucksley?&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t show any gaps, because he was faithful to the basics and excluded variables.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This style of swordsmanship was bad for Grid, who was still lacking.&nbsp;</span><span style>All of Grid’s techniques were blocked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Chaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘Hey, this...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more Grid competed with the sword, the more he understood Chucksley’s strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had the advantage in speed, but he couldn’t use it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I want to see his status window.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted to swap to the Great Lord's Sword and view Chucksley’s information.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chucksley was probably a named NPC.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he couldn’t afford to do it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjeejeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The extremely honest, but fast and powerful sword, put pressure on Grid. Grid was forced to focus on defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay! You’re doing well, Sir Chucksley!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Ren cheered after standing up.&nbsp;</span><span style>He gained confidence after seeing Chucksley overpower Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid! This is the result of your pride and self-righteousness!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could he confront 5,000 soldiers alone?&nbsp;</span><span style>The royal army was helped by Grid’s stupidity.&nbsp;</span><span style>Prince Ren was sure that he would win this war.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill him! Kill Grid and go straight to Reidan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Ren shouted while Bunny Bunny cursed in the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Dammit!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The protagonist of Bunny Bunny’s video was originally Hurent.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Hurent was dominated in an instant by a farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he tried turning the main character into Grid, but...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid is losing to Chucksley!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny didn’t want this result.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted Grid to defeat the strong enemies. However, the current situation looked helpless.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bunny Bunny was feeling resentful when a voice entered his ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The majority of the northern army seems to have survived. We made good time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny was a second advancement assassin.&nbsp;</span><span style>A person could get close to him without him noticing?&nbsp;</span><span style>They could only be a top ranker.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, the owner of the voice next to Bunny Bunny wasn’t ordinary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny turned around and was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the master of beauty, Lauel of the silver hair.&nbsp;</span><span style>One of the 10 Rookies who played for the US team in the National Competition, and someone who was now one of Grid’s top aides.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny’s eyes shone at meeting a celebrity and Lauel grinned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s interesting to see Bunny Bunny, who I’ve only seen on TV before. Are you live?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T-That’s impossible. I need to solve the problem of image rights, so I’m taking a recording.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah, it’s a relief that you aren’t stupid. Please contact me before you start the broadcast. We have to talk about the distribution of revenue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, yes. I will keep that in mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel’s profile stated that he was 20 years old. Bunny Bunny was seven years older. But he couldn’t feel comfortable around Lauel. The only thing that mattered in society was power and wealth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Earl Lauel, the soldiers are ready.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A blond man appeared behind Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was an NPC called Asmophel.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were 1,000 soldiers gathered behind him with excellent military discipline. Every soldier had killing intent in their eyes and they were orderly.&nbsp;</span><span style>Compared to them, the royal army that was considered the best in the Eternal Kingdom was like a child.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny admired it.&nbsp;</span><span style>He never imagined that Grid could train an army to this degree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid is even great at nurturing an army!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more he discovered, the greater he thought Grid was.&nbsp;</span><span style>But what was this?&nbsp;</span><span style>Why was he on the verge of dying alone in enemy territory?&nbsp;</span><span style>Bunny Bunny directed his gaze back to the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was still dueling Chucksley. He didn’t have any wounds, but it was the same for Chucksley.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chucksley overpowered Grid with his swordsmanship, while Grid made up for what he was lacking with speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The problem was that there were 5,000 soldiers behind Chucksley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The moment those 5,000 soldiers move...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The balance would collapse and Grid would die.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bunny Bunny felt nervous and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lauel, shouldn’t you help Grid?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was relaxed.&nbsp;</span><span style>As he watched the battle of Grid and Chucksley through the dust, he made a meaningful remark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You don’t know Grid’s abilities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the first place, Grid’s strength wasn’t swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know why he’s playing around with swordsmanship with that person, but I don’t need to worry. Knight Chucksley, he might be strong, but he isn’t comparable to the people that Grid has faced so far. Isn’t that right? Sir Asmophel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The opponent’s skill is still insufficient.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Playing around? A great swordsman is lacking?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny doubted his ears.&nbsp;</span><span style>He thought that Lauel and Asmophel were speaking unreasonably.&nbsp;</span><span style>At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaack!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>A terrible scream shot into the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>It must be Grid!&nbsp;</span><span style>Bunny Bunny freaked out and zoomed in on the direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is impossible!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny was at a loss for words.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The great swordsman Chucksley, who had been dominating the whole time, was now bleeding from the chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel instructed Asmophel, who shouted towards the soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aim your bows!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reidan’s soldiers moved in a sleek manner.&nbsp;</span><span style>They quickly stabilized their feet in the sand, took out a bow and pulled back the bowstring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What are they thinking?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny wondered.&nbsp;</span><span style>The distance from here to Grid was approximately 300m.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was too far to hit the mark. Even if there was a lucky shot, it was obvious that the person wouldn’t suffer a great impact because the power would be greatly reduced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Reidan’s soldiers had a hidden secret.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the power of items.&nbsp;</span><span style>Reidan’s soldiers were equipped with items produced by Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style>The power and accuracy were completely different from typical bows.&nbsp;</span><span style>What if the power of qigong master Lauel was added?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wind Dragon’s Roar.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuoooooh!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A westerly wind started to sweep through the desert.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fire!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Papat!</span></i> <i><span style>Pa pa pa pat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>1,000 arrows were simultaneously shot.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the battlefield, the royal army watching Grid was forced to accept the baptism of arrows pouring down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the first time he saw the scene of 1,000 soldiers being wrapped in a pillar of light, symbolizing they had levelled up at the same time.</span></p>
