 <p><span style>Chapter 151</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>"Hrmm.”</p>
 <p><span style>The inner sanctum of the castle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas yawned with a relaxed expression.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had a lot of work to do, so he shut off all contact for a fortnight.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was sitting at his desk and looking at his accounts book when he heard that the enemy invaded and ran out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no inspiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s fine without me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Yatan believers weren’t even suitable to be training opponents.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was about to head towards the castle when his gaze suddenly shifted towards the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>Two last rays of light were dropping from the slowly closing teleport gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are they strong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas’ eyes shone as he climbed up the stairs then onto the walls.&nbsp;</span><span style>He jumped into the gap between Laella and Zednos, who had been watching the battlefield and supporting the guild members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Many people are suffering.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laella’s shoulders were shaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Magicians had the ability to detect magic power.&nbsp;</span><span style>Laella and Zednos were able to detect the danger before Regas and they replied at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Monster.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A monster.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Two rays fell into the middle of the battlefield.&nbsp;</span><span style>A notification window popped up in front of all users in Bairan Village, including the Tzedakah Guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Fourth Servant of the Yatan Church, Neberius has appeared.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The sound of the flute that contains dark magic flows into your ears.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[There is a loss of balance and loss of concentration.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Evasion rate has fallen to 0%. Accuracy has fallen by 60%. Magic casting speed is two times slower.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[These effects will last until the sound of the flute stops.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Fifth Servant of the Yatan Church, Balak has appeared.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[He is a demonkin who controls fire. If you enter within 1m of Balak, you will receive 500 fire damage per second.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The flames of a demonkin are like God Yatan’s breath. Yatan has blessed all believers, increasing the stats of the Yatan believers by 50%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Whoa.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas’s eyes sharpened as he made an admiring sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is time to show the result of my training.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several months ago, the Tzedakah Guild couldn’t deal with even one servant.&nbsp;</span><span style>But that was the past.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Tzedakah Guild grew faster than others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Now two enemies stronger than Malacus appeared simultaneously, but they didn’t shrink back.&nbsp;</span><span style>Regas was confident, but Zednos, the number one wind magician, was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We should give up on Bairan. It’s better to go to Winston and borrow troops from Lady Irene to recapture it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The grey-haired Neberius playing the flute was very frustrating for Zednos.&nbsp;</span><span style>He noticed that there was no chance of winning with the debuffs, which acted as a counter to all physical attack classes as well as magicians.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laella rebuked him,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Recapture? Zednos, do you think they came to take over this place? No. They simply came to destroy. The moment we abandon this place, it will be turned to ashes. We can’t back down. We must fight and win.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It will waste money and time, but can’t we restore the village at any time? Isn’t it better than dying and losing experience and items?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is that the only problem? If we lose, all the NPCs will die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to rebuild the village, the power of the NPCs (residents) was essential.&nbsp;</span><span style>The buildings could be restored with time and money, but what if there were no residents? It would just be a ghost town.&nbsp;</span><span style>And in the first place, didn’t they learn from Grid that NPCs were no different from humans?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Zednos agreed,&nbsp;</span><span style>“I understand. We will fight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the guild chat window, Jishuka’s command appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Everyone converge. Go towards the middle of the village while saving the NPCs.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rooftop of a three-storey building.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka delivered the command to the chat window and glanced at Vantner. He acted as her escort as she headed for the narrow alley area.&nbsp;</span><span style>She planned to avoid the enemy’s gaze as much as possible while heading towards her destination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But they were already Neberius’ targets.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment they entered the alley, Neberius showed up and blocked the way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The power of our church rapidly weakened due to you murdering Malacus. You need to take responsibility for that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man with grey hair constantly played the flute. Nevertheless, he still spoke with clear pronunciation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Malacus can’t be compared to him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka and Vantner shrank back from the pressure emanating from the old man who wasn’t even 150cm tall.&nbsp;</span><span style>The guild members ran into the alley to protect the two of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Leave this place to us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Vantner, please look after Master!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Thank you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As an archer, Jishuka couldn’t exert her power when she was close to the enemy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thus, the Tzedakah Guild always used tactics to protect her.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were doing so even now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let's go!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guild members blocked Neberius’ way while Vantner and Jishuka entered the opposite alley.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then they were disappointed.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the end of the foggy alleyway, ten high ranking believers were waiting for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you don’t want to die, get lost!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner needed to protect his master, so he couldn’t be stopped by the poison fog.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner advanced through the poison fog and threatened the believers with his twin axes.&nbsp;</span><span style>The believers flinched and were pushed back by his momentum. Vantner used that change to lead Jishuka elsewhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They needed to reach their destination. The place where Jishuka could shoot most effectively was on the walls.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner was determined to escort Jishuka there, even if he needed to sacrifice his life.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the followers weren’t just watching in silence.&nbsp;</span><span style>They rushed forward as Jishuka left the alleyway.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Due to Balak’s passive power, the elders couldn’t be ignored.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black knights were mixed in between the black magicians and they pulled out swords hidden in their robes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner defended, but his complexion wasn’t good. He was a guardian knight, but he had the worst defense because he invested all his stat points into strength, and his armor wasn’t that good.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he didn’t back down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit...! This is me! I am a tank destroyer, you scum!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner used a guardian skill to increase his defense, fighting back against the black knights.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeok!</span></i> <i><span style>Peeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Huge strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The axes battered at the knights’ swords. However, there were 10 black knights.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner was soon surrounded and became bloody.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuoh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black magicians hid among the knights and constantly used curse magic.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner wobbled and could barely stand upright. He was frustrated as he confirmed that his health was at the bottom.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Protect Jishuka!’&nbsp;</span><span style>He vowed once again as his courage soared into the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>But courage alone couldn’t overcome the crisis.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘I am the worst.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka fired an arrow every time Vantner’s weak point was struck, but her expression eventually twisted.&nbsp;</span><span style>She wasn’t able to exert her strength properly due to the constant attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style>Meanwhile, the guild members confronting Neberius in the narrow alley after sending Jishuka and Vantner away were also in a crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Neberius used powerful black magic and they quickly died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“K-Kuack...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Dirty old...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Tzedakah Guild was a group where all members were part of the top 200 unified rankings. Every member was a monster.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it wasn’t enough to threaten the Fourth Servant, Neberius.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is with the strength of this dark magic? It has excellent compatibility with all magic power attributes. Some attributes are even enhanced by the dark magic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Neberius kindly explained it and summoned a lightning bolt.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The alley was no longer an alley.&nbsp;</span><span style>The nearby buildings simultaneously collapsed.&nbsp;</span><span style>The lightning bolt wrecked havoc.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Neberius discovered that the enemies who should’ve died were still alive and his eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then a cold voice was heard from the dust.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will kill you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The number one assassin appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>He rescued the guild members, then he moved behind Neberius and wielded his dagger.&nbsp;</span><span style>A magician had weak physical abilities and Neberius didn’t possess any defensive skills like Malacus, so he was completely vulnerable to the attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he avoided a fatal wound.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the sound of the flute.&nbsp;</span><span style>Faker’s accuracy was lowered by 60% so it was slightly off target.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hrmm...”&nbsp;</span><span style>Neberius didn’t look relaxed anymore. He touched the wound on his neck and frowned for the first time.&nbsp;</span><span style>"You are quite good?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are good as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The colleagues behind Faker were his constant companions.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past, they had been helplessly defeated by the monster girl Euphemina and trained even harder after their loss. They were also known as Faker’s group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faker communicated the situation through the guild chat window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Faker’s group, we are facing Neberius. His magic will be sealed when we draw his attention.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk... It’s hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The number one paladin, Toban, was struggling.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was trying to tie up Balak’s feet as much as possible.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, there were limits due to the continuous fire damage. Balak was also strong with the sword and Toban had already allowed several attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style>He boasted the strongest defense and highest health in the guild, but he couldn’t help speaking weakly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{This is Toban. Balak is so strong that I can’t last much longer. Where is the support from Regas and Pon?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laella checked Toban’s words and made a frustrated expression.&nbsp;</span><span style>Regas jumped off the wall to join the battle and Pon had joined after wiping out the followers at the west gate.&nbsp;</span><span style>She could see their situation from the wall and it wasn’t that good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laella explained the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{The elders are focusing on Pon and Regas. I am supporting them with magic, but it seems hard for them to leave.}&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban trembled.&nbsp;</span><span style>How good would it be if Grid was here right now? But there was no point in wishful thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Ah... How rotten. Being Jishuka’s protector is very arduous. If only Grid made my armor... Damn.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner started to grumble as he reached his limit.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a total crisis.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the strength of the Tzedakah Guild was very scary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’ve taken care of all the followers here. How about it? Should we help you? Kyaaack~ spit! How strong is a demonkin? Kukuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three new people who joined the guild, including Toon, assisted Toban with Balak.&nbsp;</span><span style>Faker could also take a breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I came!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Ibellin. The guild was scattered so he added his strength to Faker’s group. Neberius was repeatedly unable to use magic.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the good atmosphere didn’t last long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pant pant...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit... It won’t work.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’ve never see a demonkin before.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Balak is Balak, but Neberius is the problem. The debuff is too extensive and effective. I can’t attack properly due to the lowered accuracy."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The evasion rate of 0% is deadly for assassins...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the battle continued, the faces of the Tzedakah Guild became darker.&nbsp;</span><span style>Neberius and Balak were both strong, but Neberius was particularly problematic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The top priority was stopping his flute. Everyone had the same thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『The Tzedakah Guild have struggled well, but there is a limit. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The battle of Bairan Village was being broadcasted by all the media around the world.&nbsp;</span><span style>The users in Bairan Village recorded the situation and uploaded them to the Internet in real time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 The situation might improve if Regas and Pon could join the battle, but... There are 60~70 people affected by Balak’s passive skill thoroughly marking the two of them, so it can’t be helped.』&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>『In the first place, Malacus was the weakest of the Yatan Servants. The Tzedakah Guild may have defeated Malacus, but it’s still a far cry from dealing with two stronger servants. It’s obvious that the Tzedakah Guild will be wiped out without the help of the users in the top 10 of the unified rankings. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『It’s odd to see the Tzedakah Guild collapsing.』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 But it’s incredible that they lasted so long. I don’t think that anyone watching this broadcast can argue with the fact that the Tzedakah Guild is the strongest. They are fighting so well, even in the worst situation... It is great. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『Personally, Faker and Vantner seem the most impressive. Aren’t they doing a good job?』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『Vantner? Are you deceived by the splendid appearance of his swinging axes? Vantner is still immature. He didn’t pay attention to defense as a guardian knight and is paying for it. Right now, the best people fighting are Faker, Ibellin, Pon and Regas. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『Are you ignoring Laella and Zednos?』</span></p>
 <p><span style>It happened the moment when the experts were giving negative opinions about the battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『Eh? Wait a moment. Who is that person?』</span></p>
 <p><span style>A man whose face and ID were completely concealed was caught on screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『He is using Fly magic. A magician.』</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right. The person was flying in the air. Then he reached into the air (his inventory).&nbsp;</span><span style>He pulled out black armor and threw it towards Vantner, who was isolated with Jishuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner shouted something towards the man in the sky. His expression was clearly angry. But then he received the armor and smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style>At that moment, an amazing thing happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner wore the armor and his color suddenly improved?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He seemed alive again as he started to fight fiercely against the elders.&nbsp;</span><span style>The anchors and experts were stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『That armor...?』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mysterious man suddenly came and gave Vantner armor.&nbsp;</span><span style>What was the relationship between Vantner and the man, and what was the identity of the armor?&nbsp;</span><span style>The videos focused on him as anchors, experts and viewers around the world started to wonder about the man’s identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the meantime, the man once again reached into the air. This time, he pulled out a black greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man shouted at the Tzedakah Guild members.&nbsp;</span><span style>One of the guild members on the ground held up hand.&nbsp;</span><span style>The man threw him the black greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then another surprise occurred.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Tzedakah Guild member grabbed the greatsword and became stronger than before, as he started to attack Balak with a terrifying momentum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the experts had a flash of inspiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『Ah...! I know that greatsword! Isn’t it the weapon used by the butcher who slaughtered the Giant Guild members in Winston in the past?』</span></p>
 <p><span style>An anchor chimed in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『Yes! I thought it looked familiar! It really is that greatsword! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 No, then that person...? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man in the sky!&nbsp;</span><span style>People’s curiosity about his identity was amplified.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man started to arm himself.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wore beautiful white armor with gold thread embroidered on it. After that, he placed an ordinary cloak over it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Neberius, Balak and all the Yatan believers turned their gaze towards the man in unison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『Eh...? What is this phenomenon? Are they focusing on the butcher?』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Does that cloak have a taunting effect? But he’s alone, so how can he deal with all of them...? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The anchors, expert, Tzedakah Guild members and all users in the area. The attention of viewers all over the world was only focused on one man.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Saaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Did he know that hundreds of millions of people were watching him?&nbsp;</span><span style>The man put his hand into the air. Then there was a blue light as he started to pull something out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『Shark?』</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a shark-like appearance.&nbsp;</span><span style>The man pulled out a blue shark-shaped greatsword from his inventory.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he spoke the shocking name of a skill while the world was watching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Transcended Link.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>『Pagma?!』</span></p>
 <p><span style>It felt like the entire world was shaking.&nbsp;</span><span style>As the anchors and experts were shaking with astonishment, a blue-black light filled the screen.</span></p>
