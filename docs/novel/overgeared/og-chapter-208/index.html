 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you remember Rabbit?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a dear name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina met Grid due to Rabbit’s quest.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rabbit asked Euphemina to participate in the item making game against Grid, then he asked her to rescue Grid from prison.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had a smarter, more flexible mindset than most humans, so she couldn’t forget him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I remember. He was the brains of the Mero Company.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You remembered pretty quickly. What do you think about inviting him to the guild?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did Grid really share his affection with Irene?&nbsp;</span><span style>He was soaked with sweat.&nbsp;</span><span style>His upper body was somewhat revealed by the robe he loosely wore, revealing a masculine appearance. It was appropriate to call him sexy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the effect of the charm stat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s charm had sharply rising after becoming the first duke, so most people would feel favorable towards him. It was the reason why Euphemina was enchanted. But Grid wasn’t yet aware of this fact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Euphemina?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina regained her spirit and asked,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Ah, what did you say just now?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid repeated.&nbsp;</span><span style>“What do you think about inviting Rabbit to the guild?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina's opinion was positive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to invite him. Wasn’t he the one who drove the Mero Company to the top in the north? If you take into consideration his outstanding brain and experiences, his talent as a merchant and his ability to discern your value, he must be a named-grade NPC.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their encounter with Rabbit was short, but intense.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a common feeling for both Grid and Euphemina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is probably a named NPC... I agree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The current Grid was sure that Rabbit was an NPC with a much higher rating than Jude or Minor. He would be a great help if he was invited.&nbsp;</span><span style>But there was one problem.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rabbit was the hero who helped Grid and Euphemina save the people of Winston, but it couldn’t be denied that he was the number two of the Mero Company. Thanks to that, Marquis Steim sentenced him to 10 years in prison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t Rabbit still trapped in Frontier’s prison? Can you invite a prisoner to the guild? I can’t figure out how to get him out of prison."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why can’t I get him out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid opened his inventory. Then he pulled out an item he got along with Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Great Lord’s Sword]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 220/220 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 220</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Dignity +150</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Insight +150</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Leadership +150</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Skill 'Character Observation’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Skill ‘Talent Search’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A rare sword only given to the best lords.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You can observe the soldiers and residents more closely and efficiently command them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 200</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an upgraded version of the Ruler's Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid handed it to Euphemina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am a duke. With my authority, I can pardon a sinner sentenced by a marquis. Probably.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Probably.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid shrugged at Euphemina’s questioning gaze.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Will he refuse the request of his son-in-law who’s a duke? He became a marquis thanks to me, so he should listen to this small request. Isn't that right?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah, that's right. I understand. I will go to Frontier and invite Rabbit to the guild. But I don’t need this sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We don’t know. Don’t you want to examine Rabbit with the sword first in order to determine if he is worth it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Character Observation skill was created on its own once my insight reached 1,600. So I don’t need that item’s help.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“1,600...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid currently only had 1,100 insight, even if the effect of Kingdom's Hero was applied.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Euphemina was a Duplicator and her main stat was insight, so it exceeded 1,600 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m envious.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Character Observation was a skill to check the NPC’s stat information, skills information and potential.&nbsp;</span><span style>It would be much more comfortable if he could use this useful skill without relying on an item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina asked Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Should I come back to Winston with Rabbit?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid shook his head.&nbsp;</span><span style>“No, go to Reidan. We will be departing for Reidan soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina said goodbye and left the office.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was left alone and he started thinking as he looked at the Great Lord’s Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is there a hidden talent in Winston?’&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid wanted to take care of everything before leaving Winston.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘I should explore with Talent Search.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was about to head into the city with the Great Lord’s Sword when he suddenly stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That reminds me of Kesan Canyon...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It happened when Grid entered Kesan Canyon to acquire Pagma’s Swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style>The NPC who called himself the captain of the Saharan Empire’s knights had tried to give him a quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Was his name Piero? He was incredibly strong.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had never seen such a strong NPC since Doran. Who was stronger between him and Jude? Jude wasn’t a match, even armed with the +8 Dainsleif.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to invite him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid worried for a while before quickly making a decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will attempt it once.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had nothing to lose if the invitation failed.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was because the NPC had a quest related to the Saharan Empire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Reidan is near the border of Saharan, so that’s a plus.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid determined his goal and gathered the guild members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Take Khan and head to Reidan first. Join forces and organize the place until I arrive. Oh, don’t forget to take Minor along as well. I’m worried that he’ll escape if he isn’t under someone’s eyes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner was puzzled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You aren’t coming with us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I have a place I need to stop by first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel had just taken the items away from Shay’s party and he admonished Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>"You’re the leader of the guild. When you are doing your personal activities, you are obliged to explain the situation to the guild members in more detail. So that we don’t worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid briefly explained.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I am going to pick up a treasure before heading to Reidan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Treasure?&nbsp;</span><span style>The guild members were expectant after seeing Grid’s attitude. Then they left for Reindan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Reidan was located to the west of the kingdom, so it would be a long journey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’m going.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid separated from the guild, had a gratifying farewell with Irene, and ended up alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>He opened Braham’s Message as he flew towards Kesan Canyon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Are you sure you want to open Braham’s Message?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[There is unidentified magic power. You need to be careful.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid flinched.&nbsp;</span><span style>He recalled the time when he opened Braham’s treasure box in the Golem’s Labyrinth.&nbsp;</span><span style>He only opened the message after he fully armed himself with items and the pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The unidentified magic power has formed someone’s voice.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham’s voice was directly transmitted to his brain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Pagma’s Descendant, the fact that you received this message means that you’ve defeated my golem army? This is a simple warning. Gain the four blessings of the gods and make the Vessel of the Soul! Then resurrect my body! If you keep delaying, then you will suffer a disaster!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He invaded the kingdom just to intimidate me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This crazy bastard.&nbsp;</span><span style>He killed thousands of people just for that reason?</span></p>
 <p><span style>'He is beyond selfish.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid called up the information of the quest he had been postponing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Great Magician’s Resurrection]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Second Class Quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The legendary great magician Braham was a genius. He reigned as the best magician ever since he started learning magic. There was a myth that he survived against the fire dragon Trauka without dying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he grew old, he started mourning the fact that he was a mortal. Mentally and physically, he had already transcended humanity. Therefore, he wanted to become immortal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After much research, he designed the ‘Vessel of the Soul’ that will regenerate his mortal soul into an immortal soul.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the Vessel of the Soul is an object that doesn’t exist in this world and is impossible to create.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He searched for an entirely new mineral that could be used as a material for the Vessel of the Soul and learned that his old friend Pagma was trying to create a mineral that wasn’t part of this world. He went to Pagma and assisted in the work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two combined their power and created the mineral called pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham had no doubts that pavranium could be used to make the Vessel of the Soul.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the only blacksmith who could smelt pavranium was Pagma, who unfortunately died of old age.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Braham didn’t achieve his wish!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked forward to the day that Pagma’s Descendant would be born to create the Vessel of the Soul, creating 28 mines and setting up mazes all over the place before he died.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Each labyrinth is full of minerals, and he believed that it would be enough to lure Pagma's Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now 300 years have passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Out of 28 pieces of Braham’s soul that were sealed in 28 labyrinths, one has finally encountered you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham wants you to make the Vessel of the Soul. Through the Vessel of the Soul, he will be resurrected with the soul and body of an immortal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Second Class Quest Clear Condition: Create the Vessel of the Soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Second Class Quest Clear Reward: A large amount of pavranium.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to create the Vessel of the Soul, the pavranium needed to obtain four blessings.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid had a hostile relationship with the Yatan Church, so it was close to impossible to receive their blessing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No matter how much Braham threatens, it’s currently an impossible quest. There’s something strange.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Legend had it that Pagma died 100 years ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>But when reading the details of this quest, Braham’s time of death was 300 years ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>From this perspective, Braham’s story about the pavranium seemed to be full of mistakes.&nbsp;</span><span style>The past Grid wasn’t cautious and didn’t recognize this mistake, but now he was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'There’s something fishy about Braham.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, he could obtain the quest rewards with just Minor.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hadn’t Grid already found seven pieces of pavranium in the north thanks to Minor?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Magician’s Resurrection? Damn, I can’t complete this quest. If you want to warn me, then warn me. I don’t like this attitude. Damn bastard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Obviously, he had an obligation to complete the class quest. He had to clear the class quest in order to fully understand the story about Pagma and to complete his class.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid wasn’t nervous.&nbsp;</span><span style>If all of the pavranium was recovered, it was assumed that the story would develop without Braham’s help.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a wisdom he naturally acquired while clearing various types of difficult quests.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Braham’s Message has been destroyed.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid removed the ridiculous message and his flight speed increased. Then after two hours, he arrived at Kesan Canyon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It was around this place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Loran Falls was one of the most sacred places for the people of the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid shouted,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Come out! Piero!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His powerful voice echoed through the canyon.&nbsp;</span><span style>After a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"My name is Piaro, not Piero.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The middle-aged man showed up in front of Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was completely different from the past, so Piaro didn’t recognize him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who are you? Were you sent by Asmophel?”&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past, Piaro thought highly of Grid’s development. However, the current Piaro recognized Grid as strong and was very alert.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Based on your skills... It seems like you can handle the current Asmophel?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>An endless sense of dignity could be seen.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the current Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro was extremely nervous while Grid cut to the chase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You, won’t you become my knight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid observed Piaro’s details using the Great Lord’s Sword and was more stimulated than when he made a legendary item.</span></p>
