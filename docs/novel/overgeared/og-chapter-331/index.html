 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Irene's bedroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Father!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My daughter!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene and Marquis Steim hugged tightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been nine months since they had seen each other, so they couldn’t control their emotions. They checked each other’s health and shed tears of joy. In particular, Marquis Steim sniffed with a runny nose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene used to follow her father around everywhere.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now his daughter was going to be a mother, so he felt strange and lonely.&nbsp;</span><span style>Marquis Steim confirmed her appearance and shifted his gaze towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I hope you will always love and cherish my daughter like you do now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid answered with a genuine heart, without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will love her more than I do now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The child in the belly has felt the true love of the couple, increasing all stats by 1.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid whispered words of love to Irene every day, but there had been no response from the baby in the last few days.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was five days left before she gave birth.&nbsp;</span><span style>Perhaps today would be the last prenatal education.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was chatting with Irene and Marquis Steim.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Outside Irene’s bedroom, the knights of both families were standing side by side.&nbsp;</span><span style>The eyes of a young man suddenly sharpened.&nbsp;</span><span style>His name was Laden.&nbsp;</span><span style>After Phoenix, he was the best talent in the north.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There are four people, not three in the bedroom. Does Duke Grid have a shadow?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Four people?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro and Asmophel were confused at Laden’s question.&nbsp;</span><span style>They could only feel three people in Irene’s bedroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Duke Grid, Irene and Marquis Steim.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Does this young man want to show off his skills?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A knight of the marquis.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was making something simple, bigger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you say you are Sir Laden? Are you certain enough to interrupt the duchess?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene needed absolute stability.&nbsp;</span><span style>Taking the risk to go into Irene’s bedroom and making a disturbance? What if there was no third person?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was obvious that Duke Grid and Marquis Steim would be furious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro warned Laden that he would be held responsible.&nbsp;</span><span style>Laden understood and nodded,&nbsp;</span><span style>“I will take responsibility.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If so, there was no need to delay.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro knocked on Irene’s bedroom door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro and Laden confirmed Grid’s response. Then the knights of both families entered Irene’s bedroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene became upset at the crowd entering, so Grid frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is it so loud?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laden took a step forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is a rodent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rodent?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was feeling confused while Laden pulled out a sword at his waist.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he kept stabbing his sword at the ceiling?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Gone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the worst.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro hit his forehead and Grid’s expression distorted.&nbsp;</span><span style>Laden explained,&nbsp;</span><span style>"A little while ago, I felt someone hiding on the ceiling. But now they have disappeared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was dumbfounded.&nbsp;</span><span style>His insight was a huge 1,550.&nbsp;</span><span style>Faker couldn’t even secretly approach within 3m without Grid noticing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There was a rodent hiding above me? If this is true, why didn’t I know about it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laden couldn’t say anything. He just bowed his head and waited to be punished.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid asked Marquis Steim,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Who is this person?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marquis Steim replied with a little bit of embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"An outstanding person. He’s still young so he sometimes makes mistakes, please understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Northern Nova, Laden.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the moment when he was branded as a bluffer by Grid.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘Amazing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>King of Shadows, Kasim.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the strongest assassin in the world.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was surprising that he was caught by a young man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Time has given birth to talent.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Eternal Kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style>Compared with the Saharan Empire, a great number of talented people were being born in the small kingdoms.&nbsp;</span><span style>In simple terms, the Saharan Empire had 10 times the population of the Eternal Kingdom, so they produced more talent.&nbsp;</span><span style>This wasn’t a good thing from the viewpoint of Kasim, who was burning with vengeance towards the empire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Anyway, I’ll have to be more careful for the moment.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suruk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kasim disappeared into the darkness.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“My money.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid went to the smithy for the first time in a while.&nbsp;</span><span style>Two anvils were lined up next to him and on top of them, four hands were hammering like Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The young blacksmiths were amazed by the sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan approached Grid,&nbsp;</span><span style>“You look upset. What’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Marquis Steim brought a young knight and he made me upset.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huhu, giving you a bad impression. The young man is pitiful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Irene is sensitive because of the child... Ah, I want to block his career path.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a bad idea in your position. You’ve witnessed it from the side of the victim, that persecuting the weak can cause bad feelings.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Indeed. I wasn’t thinking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Up until two years ago, Grid was also weak.&nbsp;</span><span style>He knew how terrible it was to be persecuted by strong men.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now that he had power, he was thinking about abusing it?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was disappointed in himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Thank you. You’re too good for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huhu, you are also very very good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"An old man should keep his dignity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smiled and leaned his head against Khan’s shoulder for a moment.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was like a grandchild leaning on his grandfather.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the young blacksmiths thought differently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘These two are very close.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A love that transcends status, sex and even age?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Umm... They should watch their mouths.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In the midst of this deepening misunderstanding, the God Hands kept working.&nbsp;</span><span style>They produced the necessary basics for the Mass Production Set and delivered it to Grid, who only trusted himself with the high quality materials.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The skill level of the God Hand’s Blacksmithing has increased to advanced level 2.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The skill level of (Understanding of Gods’ Weapons) Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill has increased to level 7.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The number of times the Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation skill can be used has increased by three. Number of items that can be created at present: 13/21.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s growth continued today.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Run!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How rotten!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Roll!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Damn!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gear up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Dammit!'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reidan’s training grounds.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to the ‘Will of Duke Grid!’, the soldiers were being overworked today.&nbsp;</span><span style>They rolled over sand that was burning from the sun, crawled out, jumped over dangerous obstacles, and endlessly stabbed their swords and spears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How long will this last?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>These questions were on the verge of disappearing.&nbsp;</span><span style>It felt like all thoughts were being swept away due to the pain.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the process where their muscles were being reconstructed.&nbsp;</span><span style>They wanted to give up many times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The more you sweat, the more you guarantee your family’s safety.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want to go back to the old days of starvation! Then withstand it! Protect your home!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro and Asmophel cried out every time their hearts weakened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Yes, stand up!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldiers’ eyes were filled with hate.&nbsp;</span><span style>Wasn’t it funny to give up now?&nbsp;</span><span style>They had always been training with the idea of overcoming these trials.&nbsp;</span><span style>Still, they swore at Grid when they were tired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I think about it, there isn’t a war right now, so why do we need to be trained like this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Duke Grid must be bullying us on purpose!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Damn Duke Grid! Curse Reidan’s sun! Fall on the road and break your nose!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The loyalty of Reidan’s soldiers has dropped by 7.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Rumors have spread that the soldiers of Reidan hate you.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Loyalty could be raised at any time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid thought this and ordered that the training be gradually increased, not decreased.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now he started to feel alarmed.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was being hated?&nbsp;</span><span style>Wasn’t this a stage beyond resentment?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is time to give them a carrot.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid looked at the list of Reidan soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style>The list briefly listened the information of Reidan’s 1,003 soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was their name, gender, level, and occupation.&nbsp;</span><span style>The detailed stats, skills and unique story could only be checked with the Great Lord's Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s eyes widened as he sorted the list of soldiers in order of level.&nbsp;</span><span style>One person.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was one soldier who achieved level 150?&nbsp;</span><span style>Compared to the average level of the other soldiers, which ranged between 136~139, it was a tremendous growth rate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid summoned Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Did you call?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Lauel and Rabbit, Piaro was the next busiest person.&nbsp;</span><span style>It couldn’t be helped, since he had to manage the fields and army at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style>But unlike Lauel and Rabbit, who were always tired, his color was very good. It seemed he had no concept of tiredness because his basic stamina was so high.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was busy, so Grid immediately cut to the chase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"When I saw the list of soldiers, Royman stands out. What happened? What special training did you give them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Nothing. Asmophel and I instruct all the soldiers the same.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then why is Royman’s growth rate so different?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s the difference between talent and motivation. There are soldiers who follow the training schedule without thinking, but there are also soldiers who try to make it work better for their growth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hrmm, can you give extra training for the soldier called Royman?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you want Royman to grow faster?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, to at least level 160.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand. I had already planned to configure a special group, so I will direct my training towards Royman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Special group?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed to be something great.&nbsp;</span><span style>What would be the name of this special group?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Overgeared Task Force?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It happened when Grid’s eyes were shining like lanterns.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duke Grid! Irene had gone into labor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her expected due date was supposed to be in two days.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid abandoned the items he was making and ran to the castle in a hurry. Piaro also followed.&nbsp;</span><span style>A notification window appeared in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[When the baby is born, do you want it to be a boy or a girl? Your answer will have a profound impact on the child's gender.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid answered without hesitation.</span></p>
