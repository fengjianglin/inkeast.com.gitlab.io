 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Elfin Stone woke up!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he found Grid’s party today.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had killed one human every day for the past three days.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, it was strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Isn’t there the same number as yesterday?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time he wasn’t mistaken. He counted yesterday, so he knew the exact number.&nbsp;</span><span style>The number of humans hadn’t decreased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone questioned as he looked at Grid’s group.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was to find out if the person he thought he killed yesterday was alive or not.&nbsp;</span><span style>But just as humans had difficulty distinguishing between beasts, vampires had difficulty distinguishing between humans.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sniff sniff.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sniff sniff!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone was unable to find Grid with his eyes, so he sniffed like a dog.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was looking for the smell of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'This guy!'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone’s gaze fixed on Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>His air was rough, but he was a strong-looking fellow.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, he was definitely the one who Elfin Stone attacked yesterday.&nbsp;</span><span style>No, it wasn’t just yesterday, but the first and second day as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone’s eyes sank coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You, why are you still alive?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>How did he survive Extreme Blood Transfusion for three days in a row?&nbsp;</span><span style>He certainly wasn’t an ordinary guy. This was a good guy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It was a close call.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He almost missed a delicacy.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t easy for him to realize that he almost destroyed good human blood.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was thankful for the human’s survival!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Should I try it once?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Step, step.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone felt a strong appeal from Grid and moved slowly.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid shook nervously as Elfin Stone approached.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your parents must’ve had a hard time after giving birth to you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the lowest of humans thought about their parents.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then what about the vampires who recognized themselves as superior to humans?&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, the True Blood considered their parent as a god.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shizo Beriache.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was the one who gave them eternal life!&nbsp;</span><span style>She wasn’t an existence that a mere human could disparage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is the second time I have become so angry over the past 300 years!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blood rose to Elfin Stone’s head. His face distorted in a terrible manner and he shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will feed on all of you today!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone released his overwhelming magic power.&nbsp;</span><span style>It hadn’t reached the level of a great demon, but it was several times stronger than the best rated demonkin.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was slightly above Hell Gao after his flesh was destroyed by Muller.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid and Peak Sword speculated from among the astonished party members.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had fought with Hell Gao, so they could more accurately assess Elfin Stone’s strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is bad!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao had the fire stones weakness, but Elfin Stone was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid observed him with the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch, but he couldn’t grasp any weak points.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, he was one of the high ranking bosses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Shit!'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi’s aggro was too much.&nbsp;</span><span style>He stimulated Elfin Stone more than necessary.&nbsp;</span><span style>He knew he would be severely beaten up one day because he mentioned the parents, but...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why is it today?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid lamented, while Jishuka tried to encourage the party members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is fine! There’s a chance to win!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first reason they were afraid of Elfin Stone was his attack the moment he appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a level of surprise they couldn’t cope with, and they had to assume that one person would die.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now the situation had changed. Elfin Stone was in front of them, so there was no need to fear a surprise attack.&nbsp;</span><span style>If they built a good formation, there was a chance...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group had to shake their heads when Elfin Stone showed a formidable appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blood Field!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puhahahak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Magic power stretched out around Elfin Stone and dominated the land in a 30m radius.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s party was within it. To be precise, the party was adversely affected except for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your blood is influenced by Blood Field.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[153 health will be transferred to Earl Elfin Stone per second.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[All healing effects will be reduced by 80%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people with the lowest health in the party were Jishuka, Zednos and Faker.&nbsp;</span><span style>Archers, magicians and assassins all had around 20,000~30,000 health.&nbsp;</span><span style>Losing 153 health per second was a huge pressure on them. They would lost two-thirds of their life in just two minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, this health would also restore Elfin Stone?&nbsp;</span><span style>It meant that Elfin Stone recovered 1,400 health per second.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Such a scam.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fighting here means defeat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The party tried to escape from the area of Blood Field.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Elfin Stone wasn’t standing still.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Blood Requiem."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone swung both arms.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was reminiscent of the elegant actions of a conductor.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then pillars of blood fell over the party members’ heads.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Blood Requiem!&nbsp;</span><span style>It didn’t matter how many people were in the group.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Elfin Stone’s unique skill that attacked all enemies inside the Blood Field.&nbsp;</span><span style>The damage was at least 10,000!&nbsp;</span><span style>The wide area skill had incredible power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuack, how do we defeat that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'm going crazy."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members coughed up blood and took potions to restore their health.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the 80% reduction in healing effects meant the potions weren’t effective.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid urgently summoned Noe and Randy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He planned to have Noe eat Elfin Stone’s stats and have Randy copy some of Elfin Stone’s skills to increase the odds.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Noe and Randy couldn’t play a role.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t swallow the souls of noble True Blood vampires... I tried to swallow, but the curse of blood turned on me, nyang...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe’s short legs twisted and he flopped down.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was depressed that he couldn’t help Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Randy also an apologetic expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I can’t copy that target.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Didn’t you copy Pagma? Is Elfin Stone stronger than Pagma?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That wasn’t the case.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was the racial limitation and physiology that couldn’t be overcome.&nbsp;</span><span style>The True Blood vampires were a superior species to doppelgangers, so it was impossible to copy them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Dammit.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The trump cards he believed in had disappeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a desperate situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elfin Stone summoned something while Grid was feeling frustrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Iyarugt.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Yakult?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pronunciation was similar to the 200 won drink that Grid enjoyed.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it wasn’t a weapon that could be made fun of.&nbsp;</span><span style>From the handle to the blade, it was a smooth strip of red.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elfin Stone’s slightly curved sword was made of blood stone and was so sharp it could cut anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood stone!&nbsp;</span><span style>If adamantium represented the world of the gods, blood stone was a mineral that represented hell.&nbsp;</span><span style>Adamantium occasionally appeared in the human world because the gods loved humanity, but blood stones were different.&nbsp;</span><span style>There had been little present throughout the history of the human world, so it was an unfamiliar mineral to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It felt a lot different from Pagma’s words. If it wasn’t Pagma, what blacksmith could make this type of sword?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was fascinated by the beautiful appearance and rational structure of Iyarugt, when he suddenly recalled the ‘Third Piece of ???’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was because the color of the unidentified fragment was similar to the color of Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elfin Stone’s white robes flapped amidst the bloody magic power as he declared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There has only been one being who survived Iyarugt. And there will be no one else in the future."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone’s first target was Huroi.&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword defended against the blood red sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was possible to predict the behavior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone’s eyes curved up slightly.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was somewhat surprised that a human managed to defend against his sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>But that was it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword recovered the sword that confronted Iyarugt, exposing a one second gap when it was put back in the sheath.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ku...heok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The red sword moved through this gap and struck Peak Sword’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is like Iyarugt is...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was obvious that it was an ego sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>The ego sword showed its owner the best route.&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword was able to tell.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elfin Stone’s movements weren’t optimized for swordsmanship, making it difficult to predict the sword.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone was wielding the sword at Peak Sword again when a spear aimed at his side.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Pon’s Mach Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style>But even that wasn’t a big threat to Elfin Stone.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ordinary vampires could only turn all of their body into smoke, but Elfin Stone could change certain parts of his body.&nbsp;</span><span style>His waist turned into black smoke and Pon’s spear missed, then he swung his arm to counter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How the hell do we kill him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon grabbed his wounded chest and exclaimed.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the meantime, the other party members started the offensive.&nbsp;</span><span style>Flaming arrows, unpredictable kicks, swift daggers and powerful storms.&nbsp;</span><span style>Everything covered Elfin Stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not even Elfin Stone could neutralize all these attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members standards were too high.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, there was no fatal damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘We will be wiped out if this continues.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>At a time when everyone was certain, Grid thought of a way to break from this situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was only possible because it was Grid.</span></p>
