 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Beautiful and benevolent Goddess Rebecca, give your light to this weak and foolish servant who can’t move without it. I will use your light to save the weak and punish the wicked.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first prayer room.</span> <span style>Pascal was praying in a place that originally only the pope could use.</span> <span style>It was to shake off his anger about Grid and regain his senses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...May the whole world be bathed in the warm light.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long time, his prayers finished.</span> <span style>Pascal made a refreshed expression and got up from his seat.&nbsp;</span> <span style>His anger was cleansed and he was now calm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It isn’t simply riches or power that the current Grid is coveting now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was, Grid wouldn’t have been able to shake off his temptation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It seems like there is a special link between him and Damian.’</span> <span style>This was an unexpected variable.&nbsp;</span> <span style>‘But eternal friendship doesn’t exist. Even blood and flesh will kill each other in front of greed.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only concept that didn’t change in this world was faith.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ssik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal commanded with a smile, "Open the warehouse."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal’s loyal followers that he brought from the Judar Church moved immediately.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Creak.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The secret warehouse door behind the statue opened and glittering gold poured out.</span> <span style>There were treasures and gold piled up in the warehouse.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal used the secret warehouse that Drevigo had made during his days as the pope.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Grid, how much will make you satisfied?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal’s men started to gather up the gold coins. These gold coins would be used to obtain Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will offer more if it’s still lacking. If that is not enough, I will give even more. In the end, you will be caught by my hands.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan watched Pascal and asked.</span> <span style>“That person called Grid, isn’t it better to just kill him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He is the only one who can unseal the three divine artifacts of our church. He can’t die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What if you can’t obtain him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, that won’t happen. He’s very greedy. He will surely accept my heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal was confident, but Kamiyan was unsure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'He’s a wild beast. He can never be tamed.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan had noticed it when he aimed his sword at Grid’s wrist.</span> <span style>Grid didn’t blink once. He was prepared to give his hand to strike Kamiyan’s neck.</span> <span style>Honestly, it gave Kamiyan goose bumps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It isn’t a skill that develops after fighting once or twice. His momentum was overwhelming. Perhaps I would’ve had to fight properly. His power might be praised by the church, but it will be painful in many ways if he becomes an enemy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The emperor had commanded Kamiyan.</span> <span style>Pascal must become pope.</span> <span style>Kamiyan faithfully carried out the emperor’s commands, so he couldn’t neglect any dangers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan moved to avoid Pascal’s eyes and summoned an assassin from the emperor.</span> <span style>An assassin of the emperor, the assassin called ‘Crow.’</span> <span style>There was a flashing light in the darkness and the shadow asked Kamiyan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You saw that guy called Grid, right? Can you assassinate him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that a question that needs to be asked? I can even kill a mouse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t a lie.</span> <span style>Crow had the ability to assassinate enemy knights.</span> <span style>One day, the strongest assassins Doran and Kasim disappeared, so Crow was now the strongest assassin in existence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good answer. Kill Grid as soon as possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look forward to tomorrow morning. He will be hung on Goddess Rebecca’s statue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crow immediately disappeared.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Grid frowned as he was guided into Isabel’s room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a small room where the only furniture was a shabby bed.</span> <span style>A chill that would make the bones ache dominated the inside of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There isn’t even a fireplace? It will be freezing in the middle of winter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He touched the grey wall and stone powder fell down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, you will catch pneumonia.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid shook off the dust and turned to Isabel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s still like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rebecca’s Daughters had also suffered under Drevigo.</span> <span style>Despite being the strong force, they didn’t rebel against the leaders of the church and endured this unfair treatment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was frustrating when he thought about it, but what could he do?&nbsp;</span><span style>The church raised Rebecca’s Daughters as a weapon and they were taught only obedience. This deep brainwashing was like a shackle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the church’s fault, not theirs.</span> <span style>On the surface, the church expressed peace and charity, but there was no charity.&nbsp;</span> <span style>From what Grid could see, the Rebecca Church was no different from the Yatan Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Bad people.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s expression distorted as he thought about how Pascal and the elders treated Damian and Isabel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The words that the assassin Shay had spoken popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The Yatan Church is the one that stands for pure evil. They believe that evil is the right way. But the people from the Rebecca Church commit atrocities, even though they realize they have to do good deeds. The front and back are different, so they are far sneakier and more dangerous than the Yatan Church.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This wasn’t the case with the Rebecca Church in the past. But Drevigo ruined everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He caused the rot.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The current leaders of the Rebecca Church were those affected by Drevigo.</span> <span style>Most of them had already tasted the sweet fruit he offered them and realized they felt joy in harassing others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could they let go of this pleasure?</span></p>
 <p><span style>No.</span> <span style>The evidence was that they were following Pascal without trying to overcome his temptations.</span> <span style>Pruning was required.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Damian should be pope.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He might be an otaku, but Damian was a pure person. The Rebecca Church would change if he became the pope.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘First of all, Pascal can’t become pope.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal was from the empire. He was the son of the powerful Earl Chirita of the empire.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Pascal became the pope, the empire would be able to utilize the Rebecca Church freely. Lauel was convinced that the empire would become much stronger than it was now.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Someday I will become hostile to the empire when I become king, so they shouldn’t become stronger than they are now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid silently thought for a moment before opening his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Damian, you should start your campaign right now. Make sure you thoroughly advertise that I am your guardian. Huroi will help you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first ranked orator, Huroi.</span> <span style>His words had the power to capture people’s ears and hearts.</span> <span style>He would surely be a great strength to Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"In the meantime, I will seal Lifael’s Spear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid sat on Isabel’s bed. Then he observed Lifael’s Spear in her hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Legendary Blacksmith’s Appraisal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The blacksmith who became a legend can appraise items with an excellent discerning eye. If a hidden feature exists in the target item, it will be found.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Lifael’s Spear]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Myth</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 1,500/1,500</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attack Power: :1,330~1,890</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Divine Power +3,000</span></p>
 <p><span style>* All stats +200.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* 300% increase in health recovery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Fixed damage of +5,000 on each attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a high probability of activating the ‘Light Wheel’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a high probability of activating the ‘Shield of Light’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a high probability of activating the ‘Light of Guidance’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The skill ‘White Transformation’ will always be invoked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Attack power +50% against those with dark magic power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is one of the three divine artifacts of the Rebecca Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It contains a tremendous divine power that human beings can’t afford to handle, placing a heavy burden on the user’s mind and body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Rebecca’s Daughters became short-lived after being unable to cope with the power of this weapon, 5th Pope Franz asked Pagma to seal its power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Pagma’s Descendant appeared in the days of 13th Pope Drevigo and released the seal on the weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Conditions of Use: Rebecca's Daughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 400</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have already uncovered the hidden feature of the item.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>'In order to reseal this...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He needed to understand the structure of the item.</span> <span style>Then he could figure out how to make it.</span> <span style>In order to do so, the process of disassembly and assembly, as well as observation, were essential.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After becoming Pagma’s Descendant, Grid had often disassembled and assembled items. He was confident that he could quickly grasp the structure of Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s why he thought this task would be easy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But the reality is different.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Things became difficult.</span> <span style>Isabel was the problem.</span> <span style>Her health was far more serious than expected.</span> <span style>If she let go of Lifael’s Spear, she would die immediately.</span> <span style>It meant that he couldn’t disassemble Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to do it with observation.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t guarantee how long it would take.</span> <span style>But one thing was clear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isabel, I will be sure to save you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel was a precious person.</span> <span style>She was a person he shared memories with and was loved by somebody.</span> <span style>Damian thought of her the same way Grid thought of Irene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I won’t allow you to die.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid started to observe Lifael’s Spear. He carefully looked at the features several times.</span> <span style>Was it possible to raise the understanding of an item to 100% just by looking at it?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was impossible at this time.</span> <span style>It was out of reach with Grid’s current abilities.</span> <span style>But Grid believed in his imperfection.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have abilities that haven’t blossomed yet.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, if he completed the class quests, then he would gain abilities.</span> <span style>These abilities were drawn out of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can do it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s class quest couldn’t proceed at the moment. It had already been more than a year since he received it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The developers aren’t brainless or manipulative.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that they would’ve prepared some way to awaken his power in the case of an incomplete class quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The answer was likely to be hidden in Lifael’s Spear.</span> <span style>What was the reason for Grid unsealing Lifael’s Spear?</span> <span style>The system.</span> <span style>In the past, the system arrow led Grid to unseal Lifael’s Spear.</span> <span style>That lead to this present situation.</span> <span style>It was a clear arrangement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘An arrangement that will allow my skills to blossom.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s eyes sharpened as he observed Lifael’s Spear. His concentration started to rise to the extreme.</span> <span style>The willpower and spirit he trained over many experiences was in effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel’s mind calmed as she sat opposite Grid.</span> <span style>Somehow, she seemed to hear the voice of Goddess Rebecca.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Believe in him.’</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>A serene dawn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crow appeared in the shadows of the window and looked at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s already been 8 hours.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was sitting in a small room.</span> <span style>He had been examining Lifael’s Spear for 8 hours already. His mind was solely focused on Lifael’s Spear.</span> <span style>It meant he was full of holes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Rebecca’s Daughter has fallen asleep. This will be an easier assassination than I expected.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crow landed underneath a tree. Then he entered the building that contained Grid.</span> <span style>He didn’t make the slightest noise during all of this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crow moved stealthily down the hall. Even the sensitive rats didn’t detect his presence.</span> <span style>But something was looking at him from the shadows.</span></p>
