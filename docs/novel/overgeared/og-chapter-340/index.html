 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Training, training, training! And more training!&nbsp;</span><span style>Why did they have to go through such hellish days.&nbsp;</span><span style>Reidan’s soldiers had always questioned it.&nbsp;</span><span style>They couldn’t understand why they had to train so much every day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I know that it’s necessary to become stronger to protect our home and families. But still, isn’t this too much? Once we adjust to a training regime, we are forced to do a new one and then adjust to that. What if this keeps repeating?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The baker was a former soldier. I don’t think there is any army on the continent training as hard as us.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The infantry in the rear are grumbling. The level of training we receive has already exceeded the level of ordinary soldiers?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Of course. Isn’t our training at the level of special forces? It’s crazy. Why do we have to climb a wall without a ladder?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don’t like the giant worm hell training. When I move through sand that is pouring down like a waterfall, I really feel like a hamster on a wheel. Then when I see the giant worms, I get goosebumps...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isn’t it ridiculous to train new archers by firing at birds? No, we’re infantry, so why do we need to have good archery skills?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don’t understand why we have to do field work. Isn’t this exploitation of labor instead of training?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah... Why is the duke giving us such trials?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reidan’s soldiers loved and respected Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t an exaggeration.&nbsp;</span><span style>Duke Grid was the one who saved them from starving in their bleak homeland.&nbsp;</span><span style>The soldiers would lay down their lives for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But those thoughts gradually faded.&nbsp;</span><span style>As they were forced to do harsh training by Grid, this gratitude disappeared and hatred started growing.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a natural phenomenon.&nbsp;</span><span style>The training that the soldiers of Reidan received?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was similar to the training received by the Black Knights, the second strongest knights division of the empire.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was much higher compared to normal training, so it was at a mental and physical level that ordinary soldiers couldn’t afford.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But they somehow managed to endure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro and Asmophel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was possible because the two people, who were originally supposed to be pillars of the empire, instructed them.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Prepare!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A westerly wind started blowing in the desert.&nbsp;</span><span style>The soldiers of Reidan pulled back their bowstrings without a single error.&nbsp;</span><span style>These were the poisonous eyes of those who had endured the hell training.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was struggling on the battlefield alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shoot!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pak!</span></i> <i><span style>Pa pa pa pa pak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The 1,000 soldiers simultaneously fired their bows.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their posture was really good and the arrows flying with the wind were perfect.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk!</span></i> <i><span style>Puuoooook!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Kyaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hik!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan had achieved Advanced Blacksmithing level 8.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was Albatino’s descendant, and Grid’s friend and disciple, so the power of the arrow and bows he produced were beyond imagination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The arrows flew 300m away and killed the royal troops.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do it again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldiers of Reidan became covered with the level up pillars of light as the number of casualties in the royal army increased.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their strength, stamina, and agility increased as they pulled the bowstring again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s form was seen in their fierce gazes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Duke Grid!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is why you forced us to do such difficult training!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You predicted the enemy’s invasion!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am impressed with My Lord’s foresight! I really admire you!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Today.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The unexpected invasion of Reidan and the misunderstanding involving Grid allowed all their hatred to disappear. Loyalty burned fiercely inside them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Facing the enemy alone to minimize the damage!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>'You are truly great and courageous!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will devote myself more to you!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the first battle they had been in since they started training with Jude.&nbsp;</span><span style>The soldiers of Reidan showed a high concentration which greatly affected their skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shoot!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pak!</span></i> <i><span style>Pa pa pa pa pak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Asmophel ordered and arrows once again flew.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk!</span></i> <i><span style>Puuoooook!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuheok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reidan’s soldiers kept growing in real time through level ups.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Hundreds of royal soldiers couldn’t endure the powerful arrows and died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Ren was severely shaken.&nbsp;</span><span style>The 5,000 soldiers were focused on Grid and allowed a surprise attack.&nbsp;</span><span style>The shock was huge.&nbsp;</span><span style>He felt desperation and despair on this battlefield where one man demonstrated an absolute power.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Ferrell, the chief archer of the Eternal Kingdom, was amazed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Don’t tell me that they’re all archers!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reidan’s 1,000 soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style>Firing arrows from a distance of 300m wasn’t something that ordinary soldiers were capable of.&nbsp;</span><span style>By default, talented people needed to train their archery skills for 10 years before being capable of this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus Ferrell was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I thought that Reidan was a dying city.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were 20,000 people in the city and Grid had only taken over it for 16 months.&nbsp;</span><span style>He could train such elite archers in only 16 months?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was nonsense.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was impossible.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ferrell was confident because he had personally trained archers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Also!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He heard that Reidan had a total of 1,000 troops.&nbsp;</span><span style>Wasn’t it probable that all 1,000 would be archers?&nbsp;</span><span style>No.&nbsp;</span><span style>An army without infantry was powerless.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid would be insane to train an entire army to be archers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It can’t be...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A shocking thought passed through Ferrell’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What if they’re all knights?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Archery was included in the arsenal of knights, and a knight level talent would be capable of learning archery to this degree after 16 months.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This! Reidan is a complete gold mine!’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were so many talents to train as knights!&nbsp;</span><span style>Ferrell misunderstood and pulled out his bow.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the Thunder Bow, which was a family heirloom passed down from generation to generation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Reidan...! I will cut off that bud!’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pachik!</span></i> <i><span style>Pachichik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thunder sparked as Ferrell pulled back the bow.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a flash and an arrow that was more like a lightning bolt flew.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The screaming in the sky!&nbsp;</span><span style>Thunderbolts after thunderbolts appeared in succession.&nbsp;</span><span style>Reidan’s 1,000 soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style>They didn’t know what to do when faced with the magic arrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Suddenly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldiers of Reidan had endured hell training that put them on the verge of death.&nbsp;</span><span style>But this was the first time they experienced such a sudden danger.&nbsp;</span><span style>They paled as they saw the flying arrow, then someone appeared in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With his red cloak flapping, it was Asmophel.&nbsp;</span><span style>He took out a long sword that he had used since his days in the Red Knights.&nbsp;</span><span style>He moved his sword in a trajectory that was like a stream of paper, or a calligrapher writing on blank paper.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ferrel’s vision was as good as a hawk, so he was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the first time he saw a sword destroying his arrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Even Captain Chucksley can’t face my arrow head on...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ferrell was astonished and blinked blankly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Try and stop this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no meaning for an archer who couldn’t hit his target.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ferrell was the best archer in the kingdom and fired his bow again.&nbsp;</span><span style>The arrow he fired this time was several times stronger and faster than the previous one.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thunder rang out as the arrow flew towards Amosphel’s nose.&nbsp;</span><span style>The corners of Asmophel’s gorgeous lips curved up.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was this his first chance to play an active role since serving Duke Grid?&nbsp;</span><span style>The only thing he had done so far was collect gold coins and train the soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asmophel wanted to prove his value by playing an active role and Ferrell was a good opponent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asmophel’s manifested a red aura and blocked Ferrel’s arrow with his strength, then he shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will cut off the enemy’s head!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Taack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It happened when Asmophel jumped from the sand dune and was about to head to the enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That bow, it looks good?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be precise, he was interested in the materials that made up the bow.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t hide the greed in his eyes as he reached Ferrell first.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asmophel wanted to cry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"My Lord! Please give me a chance to work!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asmophel’s voice failed to reach Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was due to the screams of the thousands of confused royal soldiers being attacked that dominated the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuk...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ferrell was only focused on Asmophel.&nbsp;</span><span style>He thought Grid was fighting Chucksley and had no idea that he would receive a surprise attack.&nbsp;</span><span style>He allowed the attack and started bleeding, while Grid connected the next blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Iyarugt’s option effect is activated, reducing the target’s healing power by 50%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Iyarugt’s option effect is activated, giving the target a bleeding status that will last for 3 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The 3rd combo has been achieved!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The bleeding effect is maximized. The damage that the target will receive is increased by 200% for 1 second.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Now!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s eyes shone as he aimed at the named NPC who had a high health.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Pinnacle.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Pinnacle descended.&nbsp;</span><span style>Blood spurted like a fountain from Ferrell’s chest, filling his field of view as Grid raised his sword to strike again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The 5th combo has been achieved!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The target’s thinking ability has been destroyed for 0.3 seconds! You can link Hell Sword.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the blink of an eye.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ferrell was stunned by the repeated onslaught.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hell Sword.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwajik!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pajijijijijik</span></i><span style>―!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dozens of red-black stems emerged from Iyarugt and pierced Ferrell’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sight,</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay! Gorgeous! The best!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny’s video seamlessly moved between the sky and the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid dominating the battlefield would surely be passed onto the viewers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ferrell!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chucksley fell victim &nbsp;to Grid who suddenly used a skill when exchanging sword blows.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was outraged by the sight of Ferrell being blindsided due to his carelessness and attacked Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rising Sword!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an extremely irregular technique that looked like it rose from the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chucksley was sure that Grid would be hit by this technique.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he was wrong.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reason why Grid was unable to subdue Chucksley despite his speed advantage was due to the firmness of the swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chucksley used a big technique and abandoned his own strength, revealing a gap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was hit in the chest while Chucksley’s waist was struck.&nbsp;</span><span style>The difference between the two sword skills was clear.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was hurt in a much more deadly area.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the moment when Chucksley seemed to have the initiative.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ohhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My Lord!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Ren and the royal troops cheered, while Asmophel and Reidan’s soldiers felt desperate.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even Bunny Bunny’s face darkened as he filmed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Except for one person.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel had a smile on his face as he looked at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Gotcha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid grasped Chucksley’s neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My Lord’s strength isn’t swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel shrugged.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was a fact that the two people knew.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid wasn’t a swordsman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s being overgeared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Receiving a wound in a critical area?&nbsp;</span><span style>His armor had outstanding defense and minimized the damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t hit the enemy?&nbsp;</span><span style>He would maximize his damage with superior weapons.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Clink!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Clink clink.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Four golden hands flashed and surrounded the gasping Chucksley.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then a white flash stunned the battlefield.&nbsp;</span></p>
