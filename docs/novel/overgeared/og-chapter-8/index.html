 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style> “Uwaaaack! Doran, that bastard! He forcibly gave me a quest I didn’t want, only to kill his teammate? Fuck! Thieves, robbers, and thugs, now I know why there are all these names. Doran! In the future, this name itself will be a curse!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I left the capsule, opened the window and shouted outside.&nbsp;</span><span style>The rain was strong so my voice wasn’t heard by the people in the neighborhood.</span><span style>Thanks to that, I was able to shout for a long time. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t 4 o’clock in the morning yet.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a day when my family could rest until late afternoon due to the heavy rain, but I couldn’t access the game for 12 hours during such a golden holiday season!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Level -3...the more I think about it, the worse I feel. Doran, Doran, Doran!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I headed to the bathroom to cool off my head that was flush with anger.&nbsp;</span><span style>I soaked my face in cold water and listened to the gushing stream of water.&nbsp;</span><span style>I felt much better after washing my head for two days straight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Doran isn’t to blame for the situation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike my prediction, Doran was extremely strong and fought well. I was a bridesmaid and didn’t have to do anything. Doran took care of all of the enemies by himself. I only had a chance to succeed in the quest due to Doran’s power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, Doran did really well.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, an unexpected situation occurred.&nbsp;</span><span style>The appearance of a ranker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Damn witch...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why had Yura appeared there?&nbsp;</span><span style>She was a black magician. The Yatan Temple was an important base for black magicians, so it wasn’t unusual for her to appear there at any time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why did Yura interfere?&nbsp;</span><span style>I was an intruder in the temple and she was obliged to protect the temple. It was obvious that she would be hostile to me.&nbsp;</span><span style>That was understandable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The moment I accepted the quest, the black magicians in the temple had a separate quest to stop me. The real enemies are the users, not the NPCs. There is a reason why Doran was so strong. No wonder why the S-grade quest felt too easy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I concluded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Witch... thanks to me invoking the quest, you were able to receive a lot of benefits. A girl who didn’t shed blood or tears. She tried to kill me instead of thanking me...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>After I died, Yura would’ve succeeded in the quest. Yura was strong and Doran was quite exhausted.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was really detestable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was because of me that Yura received the quest in the first place, and the reason Doran was so tired was because I was weak. Yura just sat back and ate bread. The bread that I had put in her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bad person...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A ranker over level 200 had snatched the quest of a minus level!&nbsp;</span><span style>I entered the capsule, connected to the Internet, and then searched for Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura, I just typed it in and hundreds, no, thousands of related links filled the screen.&nbsp;</span><span style>I only checked the postings of highly popular blogs and large-scale communities and managed to get information about Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Contrary to her creepy nickname of the ‘Blood Witch’, she was well loved and respected, as well as a target of envy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to her superb beauty, perfect gaming skills and ideal image in the media, she was praised by both men and women. It also transcended race. There were thousands of fan clubs created on overseas servers.&nbsp;</span><span style>At first glance, she was even more popular than Hollywood’s top actors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘That is the modern world now.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy was more colorful, thrilling and dramatic than any movie, so the main characters of Satisfy enjoyed more popularity than movie stars.&nbsp;</span><span style>If someone watched TV these days, hundreds of channels were filled with Satisfy related programs. They also achieved high ratings, so Satisfy profession news channels were created.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, it wasn’t just limited to South Korea. Satisfy had more than two billion users. The broadcasting market wasn’t just South Korea, but the world.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a result, the movie actors received less exposure than Satisfy’s protagonists, the rankers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In particular, Yura was much more recognizable than other rankers due to her beauty. Thanks to that, she had both money and fame.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a perfect contrast to me, who was in debt due to Satisfy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am suffering because of the game, while she is living a fantastic life because of it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enjoying her favorite game while being recognized by the world?&nbsp;</span><span style>I was incredibly envious. If I was Yura, I would have no disappointments in my life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...A person like you had to take &nbsp;away a poor person’s quest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wasn’t a witch. She was just a really wicked girl.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaduduk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>I opened up the hologram keyboard and started to comment on Yura related posts one by one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yura is garbage. She interfered in the quest of a low-level user. She is completely different from her appearance on TV. Her personality is rotten.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yura isn’t very pretty when you see her in real life. She got plastic surgery a facelift. There is dirt on her nose and she always looks like she is chewing shit. Her smile is just for the TV.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Why is Yura good??? She is a bad person. How many people has she ruined? She also ruined my brother-in-law.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A ranker interfered in a quest!! Don’t be fooled by the image created on TV.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huhuhu...! Kukukuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I informed people about what I actually experienced with Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style>I felt great because I became a great journalist who spread the truth to the people deceived by false information. The terrible reality that I experienced a while ago was gradually fading from my mind!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tadak.</span></i> <i><span style>Tadadak.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>I continued posting comments.&nbsp;</span><span style>My ten fingers tapped against the hologram keyboard that glowed in the darkness.&nbsp;</span><span style>A person tapping on the keyboard in the darkened room, someone who saw it might think it was beautiful and mysterious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oppa... have you finally gone crazy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Writing malicious comments... no, it was a movement to reveal the truth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>I jumped in surprise at the voice that was suddenly heard. I turned my gaze towards the source and saw Sehee staring at me from the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You surprised me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I placed my hand on my chest, while Sehee entered my room with folded arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was going to the toilet when I heard Oppa giggling in your room. You were crazy about the game, so I thought you went crazy in reality. I was worried about Oppa and decided to check on you. Are you crazy? Please say that you’re not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Why are you speaking like that to your Oppa? I’m not crazy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’m glad you’re not crazy yet. Urgh, something smells. Take a look at your head, you should wash more. And get rid of that bowl of rice that you ate! No, why are you eating rice in your room in the first place? You should eat together with us... bah, no.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee looked at the empty rice bowls and side dishes that I stacked up and started cleaning up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>'This girl, she is nice and pretty. It is good that she doesn’t resemble me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I watched her approvingly. Sehee felt my gaze and turned around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don’t just sit there and watch. If you’re not busy, shouldn’t you help? No. Go and wash up. I don’t like that appearance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Leave it and I’ll take care of it. Why are you getting up when it isn’t even morning yet? Go back to sleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I saw Oppa laughing in a creepy manner, so my sleepiness has fled. Please go wash up. I want to see your face properly after a long time... ah, no! Wash off that dirty and unpleasant scent!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Sehee was one year old, I was nine years old.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was it right for my younger sister to act like this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I knew this would happen, I would’ve washed up when I washed my head.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I headed to the bathroom in an annoyed mood. I washed my head with soap and dried it with a towel.&nbsp;</span><span style>But why was my hair so stiff?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...It was laundry soap.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I returned to my room with my stiff hair and smelled something different in my room. It was a rather refreshing scent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Did she spray perfume? Sehee was truly meticulous.&nbsp;</span><span style>The room had been cleaned and tidied up during the time I used to wash up.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was a very diligent girl, unlike me. She would be a nice bride.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I saw Sehee sitting in the capsule and laying down on my bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Connect to the Internet if you want~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyway, it wasn’t like I could access the game. I easily yielded the capsule to my little sister.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee shrugged and unexpectedly sent me a look of disdain.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Oppa... are you a keyboard warrior?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Keyboard warrior?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>What did that mean?&nbsp;</span><span style>When I looked up, Sehee got up and pointed her finger to the monitor floating in front of the capsule.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why are you spreading false rumors about a woman younger than you? Even if there is a reason, this behavior is too naughty. I’m really disappointed in Oppa.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her voice sank. Sehee was sincerely angry.&nbsp;</span><span style>I belatedly realized my mistake and hurriedly checked the monitor.&nbsp;</span><span style>The damning list of comments that I made about Yura was still showing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dammit! I should’ve turned off my Internet window!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“S-Sehee, this...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How low.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I tried to explain to Sehee, but she returned to her room and locked the door without giving me a chance to talk. The door wouldn’t open, no matter how pathetically I acted.&nbsp;</span><span style>I realized that the last bit of good opinion my sister had towards me was completely lost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This...what is this!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is all due to that witch!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I appealed to Sehee in front of her room. I didn’t realize that I fell asleep there until I was woken up by my mother.&nbsp;</span><span style>My body wasn’t trained at all! It hurts...</span></p>
 <p><span style>I placed a cold patch on my body and fell asleep again.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the next day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huaaah~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I opened my eyes and saw that it was 11 a.m.&nbsp;</span><span style>My parents went to work at dawn and Sehee would be in school for three hours already.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I slept only six hours. I can’t oversleep because of my diligence... Why did God make me so diligent?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I scratched my hips above my underwear while heading to the kitchen. I was hungry but it was too annoying to cook.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Forget it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I ignored the protesting cries of my stomach and headed to the living room. Then I lay on the sofa and turned on the TV.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a Satisfy related channel&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy was even covered on the housewives channel. The title of the program was ‘How to meet a young man through Satisfy!’ It was a program that dealt with the process of making a character in Satisfy look as young and pretty as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'...PD Cheon Jaende?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed to have pretty high viewership. I skipped past a man who didn’t think he would live long after a phone call from his wife.&nbsp;</span><span style>I stopped at a program called ‘Satisfy’s Hot Issues.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A cute female reporter was greeting an Asian youth around my age.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a close up of the young man’s face. At the bottom of the screen, the ID ‘Katz’ and level ‘203’ appeared as subtitles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Katz is already level 200?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Katz was a celebrity. He was notorious due to his arrogance, but he was always one of the top ranks in the warrior class.&nbsp;</span><span style>Three months ago, he was level 170 but now he was already level 203?&nbsp;</span><span style>At that level, he would be at the top of the unified rankings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'How did he get over 30 levels in three months?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reporter on screen was asking the same question as me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Katz, did you know that you are one of the biggest issues in Satisfy these days?</span></i> <i><span style>Our producers were very surprised.</span></i> <i><span style>In just three months, Katz has climbed up to the 53rd ranking.</span></i> <i><span style>What is the secret to your rapid growth over such a short period of time?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Katz swept a hand over his well-trimmed hair and smiled smugly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Three months ago, I obtained an epic class.</span></i> <i><span style>I accepted this interview today to reveal my epic class.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Yes?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The reporter was shocked and I also stopped scratching at my groin.&nbsp;</span><span style>The news of an epic class was so shocking that the reporter couldn’t respond to Katz.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past year, only two epic class changes had appeared in Satisfy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Its value transcended the imagination. But Katz got his hands on a new epic class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'The third epic class...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no information about the previous epic classes that appeared. The contents of the first class change book were confidential when circulated around the item trading sites, and no one knew who the owner was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second epic class belonged to Agnus, who was ranked 7th on the unified rankings, but nobody knew what class he had.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was because most users, especially top rankers, were extremely reluctant to disclose their information.&nbsp;</span><span style>Information was power!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a fierce competition to survive in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>The information shared among large sites was actually quite limited. Most users kept their information to themselves. I would do the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Katz was revealing his class himself. He was famous for liking colorful and prominent things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyway, this was a huge scoop. It was possible that the ratings record might be broken.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>I remained fixed on this channel.&nbsp;</span><span style>I focused on the screen, while the reporter’s eyes were shining with excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>What class are you?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>The name of my epic class is ‘Blood Warrior’.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Is it as special and terrible as the name implies?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t special or terrifying. It was a very common and mundane name. A sloppy name for an epic class.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Katz seemed to like the childish name.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>The name isn’t that great, but it is a very fantastic class.</span></i> <i><span style>Let me tell you one important feature...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Katz pulled out the sword hanging from his waist, emitting a tremendous aura. I would be able to pay off all of my debt if I just sold that sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Look.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Katz’s eyes were tinged with red. At the same time, his sword started to wriggle.&nbsp;</span></p>
