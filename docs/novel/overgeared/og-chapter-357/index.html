 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>All paladins had similar swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every time they wielded the sword, they poured their whole heart into it, making it close to the concept of breaking the target.&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to this, the orbit was simple, and when the attack failed, it inevitably revealed a gap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yoshimura had a lot of experience and was aware of this fact.&nbsp;</span><span style>How could an archer with high agility struggle against a paladin?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was like that until now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>For Yoshimura, paladins were merely solid targets. They wouldn’t easily fall down, but they weren’t a threat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian was the exception.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every time Damian wielded his sword, Yoshimura’s body became covered in wounds.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yoshimura couldn’t avoid his attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You..! How can a paladin use such splendid swordsmanship? Is it because you’re a hidden class and not a paladin anymore?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an incorrect guess.&nbsp;</span><span style>As Goddess' Agent, Damian was still a paladin.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, it was a unique class.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was able to learn a higher Sword Mastery skill than general paladins, and that was the key to his high quality swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style>Furthermore, Damian...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m a paladin. A paladin with the strongest master.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian was a person taught by Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>He grew by leaps and bounds when he was farming under Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was thanks to a clear enlightenment, as well as the quest reward for ‘★ Hidden Quest★ Fun and Exciting Training!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Supreme Swordsmanship might be slower than other swordsmanship techniques and less varied, but it is the most excellent one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A good sword might be controlled with strength, while an excellent sword is controlled by the mind and heart. It can accelerate according to the speed of the mind, while making many changes like the heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a paladin, Damian couldn’t understand it.&nbsp;</span><span style>If this was reality, Damian wouldn’t have felt anything from Piaro’s teachings.&nbsp;</span><span style>But a game was different from reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have received the teachings of the sword by Piaro and awakened!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Accuracy is increased by 30% when wearing sword type weapons. This effect is applied separately from the Sword Mastery skill.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, it was an additional reward for the hidden quest.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian was well behaved and built up a great deal of favor during the hidden quest, and was able to gain great strength thanks to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The strongest teacher? What are you saying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need for you to know.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuaaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yoshimura was deeply stabbed in the side and eventually sat down.&nbsp;</span><span style>Orochi saw this and ran over aggressively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How dare you do this to Master!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The strongest person in the Sakura Guild, Orochi.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the master of twin swordsmanship. He was particularly strong in PvP as a high ranking player, capable of dazzling the target with his swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he wasn’t Damian’s opponent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian scoffed as he easily defended against Orochi’s sword with a shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even Reidan’s farmer who likes potatoes will yawn against you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reidan’s farmer who likes potatoes?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Who is that?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did he mean the legendary farmer who caused an uproar in the world by smashing Hurent and 2,000 troops in a short amount of time?&nbsp;</span><span style>Orochi felt doubts.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Damian pushed at Orochi using his shield and then stabbed his chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You aren’t my opponent. You should at least be a temporary farmer in order to deal with me. Oh, I am still lacking compared to him.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Temporary farmer?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I also don’t know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From then on, &nbsp;a one-sided massacre took place.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Sakura Guild lacked a third advancement class, so they were totally overwhelmed by Damian, who was over level 300.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian’s basic defense was high and his healing was fraudulent, so it was difficult to kill him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that Damian’s endurance in battle was the best.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Rebecca’s Daughters candidates were also a problem. The Sakura Guild’s hands and feet were tied up because they thoroughly assisted Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit! Shitt!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once their colleagues started dying, the Sakura Guild members became angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yoshimura cried out,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Why? Why are you helping a Korean person!?” (TL: Once again, a Japanese word meaning Korean person that has negative connotations)</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Korean person? What an old-fashioned and racist remark. You should apologize.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You... Keook...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian no longer continued the conversation.&nbsp;</span><span style>He knew that the opponents weren’t worth talking with, so he just silently killed the Sakura Guild members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On this day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sakura Guild suffered big damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>All the guild members died and lost experience and some items. It was a huge loss, making them unable to do anything big for a while.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Grid became certain of one thing after the spar with Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>His goal of becoming the best wasn’t a fanciful dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Geniuses... No, it’s true that my talent is poo compared to the general public.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t deny it, since it was a reality he’d realized since his childhood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had a weapon that no one else had.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the power of items.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t the usual items, but the items which had collapsed the sky above the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘First, polish the weapons.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to regular users to obtain items, they had to devote themselves to raids or hunting. However, Grid was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a legendary blacksmith, he was able to produce ideal items directly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But it isn’t easy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a limit on the performance of items.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was virtually impossible to make a 10 billion damage weapon that could kill a target unconditionally, or to be invincible by making a 10 billion defense armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s about creating ideal items within the limits.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It couldn’t be done by staying in the smithy. Grid knew from experience.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then what did he have to do?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reidan’s smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was locked in thought for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Expand my insights.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would it be possible to build up his current skills if he was alone like Kraugel, even if he was a genius?&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t possible.&nbsp;</span><span style>Through repeated adventures, meeting new people and enemies, and learning and growing through them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I should do that.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a place that Grid decided to go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Behen Archipelago.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was made up of 66 islands.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even Kraugel had only managed to reach the 30th island. By challenging it and experiencing new things, he could overcome his shortcomings and design more ideal items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The determined Grid moved to the castle.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Abu! Abuuuu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Welcome back."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene and Lord welcomed Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Irene’s affectionate gaze and Lord’s envious gaze were directed towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I want to make them happy for the rest of my life.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy was different from reality. Enemies were everywhere and his precious people could be in danger at any time.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to completely protect them, Grid wanted to become stronger.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid summoned Lauel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Did you call?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel, who was buried in a pile of papers in his office, came running wildly.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was thankful for his diligence, despite always being tired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m incompetent, so you’re experiencing a lot of hardships by taking on everything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I wanted to do it. You don’t have to worry. Continue to rely on me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, I will believe in you and leave for a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m planning to go to a place called the Behen Archipelago. Please look after Reidan and my family while I’m not here. Ah, can I also take some of the potions produced by the alchemy facility?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? Ah yes, of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was confused, but he didn’t ponder over Grid’s choices and actions.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had become more cautious since the spar with Kraugel, so Lauel thoroughly trusted him.&nbsp;</span><span style>After that, Grid made love to Irene, said goodbye to Lord, and left for the Media Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aba! Abubu! Abu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord held the ‘Baby’s Wooden Sword’ in his hands and cried out as he looked at his father’s distant back.&nbsp;</span><span style>But there was no one who could understand the baby’s words.&nbsp;</span><span style>People thought that Lord was just saying goodbye to his father.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the truth was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few days later.&nbsp;</span><span style>After some suffering, the pope procession succeeded in crossing the desert and finally arrived in Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian’s heart was overflowing with joy.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was happy because he could see Grid and Piaro, who had helped him a lot without blaming him for being an otaku.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the touching reunion didn’t occur easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A murderer like you can’t enter the city!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldiers guarding Reidan’s gates blocked Damian’s way.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was unavoidable.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian’s name was bright red from killing the Sakura Guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, I’m the pope.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Nonsense!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why would the pope commit such butchery?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A murderer is trying to lie! Disgraceful person! Get out now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, Damian was able to enter Reidan due to Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid wasn’t there anymore.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>There were countless players hoping to cross to the East Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were those who wanted to get ahead of everyone else, those who aimed for a reversal in a new land, etc.&nbsp;</span><span style>All types of people tried to reach the East Continent. The wealthy even invested an astronomical amount of money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, most of them failed to reach the East Continent.&nbsp;</span><span style>They became stuck at the Dead Sea.&nbsp;</span><span style>Only a very small number of people succeeded.&nbsp;</span><span style>Out of two billion users, less than 1,000 succeeded in figuring out how to get to the East Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were the people who grasped the existence of Sage Sticks by clearing a lot of linked quests.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, fewer than 10 people managed to cross to the Eastern Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Behen Archipelago.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a difficult task to break through the 66 islands, which were like an instant dungeon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sigh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long journey, Grid arrived at the Behen Archipelago and took a deep breath to calm himself down.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was he nervous because he remembered Kraugel saying that even famous high rankers had been eliminated at the first island?</span></p>
 <p><span style>No.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was actually filled with confidence.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reason for his deep breathing was to stop himself from becoming angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Now, shall I get started?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid readied himself and started to cross the bridge between the mainland and the first island.&nbsp;</span><span style>A notification window appeared at the end of the bridge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Do you want to enter the instant dungeon ‘Behen Archipelago’?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The ‘Behen Archipelago’ is limited to one person and the escape method is unknown. Death is highly likely. Do you still want to enter?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s body was sucked into the gate.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s been a long time since there was a challenger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hidden sage, Sticks.&nbsp;</span><span style>He gazed into his magic ball and saw a man with black hair.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sticks examined him closely and didn’t feel inspired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anyway, he will be eliminated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first island dropped the challenger’s stamina to the limit. Faced with the terrible limit, they would cause their own self-destruction.&nbsp;</span><span style>Over the past few decades, most challengers lost their lives at the first island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks was sure that the same thing would happened to this black-haired man.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the result was different from what he expected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok! N-No, how...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style>He looked like he saw a ghost.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was natural.&nbsp;</span><span style>The first island.&nbsp;</span><span style>The goal was to take advantage of the island terrain to hold out against the monsters that appeared ‘infinitely’ for 20 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They should reduce the area that the monsters could attack from by moving to the highlands or into narrow places.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a common strategy, but most people didn’t survive for 20 minutes even if they knew the strategy. There was a limit to their stamina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the man with black hair used an unconventional method.&nbsp;</span><span style>He cleared the first island easily without using a strategy.&nbsp;</span><span style>After summoning four golden hands that each held a weapon, he waited for the monsters to appear and killed them.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a method that destroyed common sense, making even the sage Sticks embarrassed.</span></p>
