 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s shocking strength and bravery were backed by his items. It was enough to qualify as a tiger.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was relatively easy to avoid the combo of Transcended Link and Linked Kill Wave, but even Russia was forced to shrink back from the power of the items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Alexander was overwhelmed... I didn’t know that the power of items was this much.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It isn’t a match for Kraugel, but it can be compared to Night.&nbsp;’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There’s a limit on what the three of us can do.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Night, an unofficial ranker who destroyed Alexander at the PvP competition held by the Russian government.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was so strong that they were reminded of Night’s strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Russian representatives shuddered, while the third advancement users thought quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The two second advancement classes failed to escape from Grid’s Transcended Link and fell down the mountain.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Those two are weak. If we’re killed by Grid, it’s impossible to win with just Kraugel and those two.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘We should compromise here.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Step, step.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was approaching.&nbsp;</span><span style>If they didn’t want to experience a catastrophe, they needed to make a quick decision.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Russia representatives made a suggestion to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How about making an alliance?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haven’t you suffered a big loss of power? We won’t fight until the end, instead we will help each other out with other countries. Won’t we be invincible if we join forces?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let’s share the gold and silver medal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Russians thought that Grid would willingly accept the proposal.&nbsp;</span><span style>Currently, the only survivors of the Korean team were Grid, Yura, and Peak Sword. It was also clear that Yura and Peak Sword would soon be logged out by Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid would be left alone.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid will stubbornly fight.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>'It’s the end for South Korea if Grid dies.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If Grid isn’t a fool, he won’t fight us until the end.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Russian representatives were sure of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What if I don’t want to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid showed an unexpected reaction.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was he stupid?&nbsp;</span><span style>No.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had steadily developed in the past year. It wasn’t just his power, but his thinking abilities as well.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was always aware of Lauel’s advice and grasped the battlefield more accurately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The moment we ally with each other, it’s likely that the other counties busy fighting each other will become alert towards us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The countries currently alive were powerful. It wouldn’t be good if they worked together in a pincer attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s make it simple. I will kill you here as originally planned.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Russians thought it was absurd.&nbsp;</span><span style>They hurriedly tried to persuade him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Think about it calmly! It’s better to combine strengths rather than fighting and destroying both of us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Destroying?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid asked like he didn’t understand.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I will be destroyed by you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Russian representatives frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is with this reaction? Don’t tell me you believe that you can easily beat the three of us alone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It doesn’t seem that hard?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid shrugged as he held Grid’s Greatsword + Failure, which only had a short duration remaining.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s Greatsword and Failure were both weapons with a legendary rating.&nbsp;</span><span style>Once they were joined together through Item Combination, their power exceeded the ‘sealed’ myth rated weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a weapon that couldn’t be understood using the common sense of current users.&nbsp;</span><span style>What happened if the Rune of Darkness effect was added to the Blacksmith’s Rage buff skill?&nbsp;</span><span style>It would make the 50% drop in PvP damage pointless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Opening the Rune of Darkness. Demonic power has permanently increased by 10. * For one minute, 20% addition shadow damage will be added to normal attacks and skills.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Blacksmith's Rage has been used. Attack power will increase by 25% and attack speed will increase by 40% for 35 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid rushed towards the Russian representatives.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Russians clicked their tongues at his ridiculous judgment and threw their weapons to weaken Grid’s power.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Teteteteng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid surrounded his body with the black cloak and the weapons thrown at it were stuck or bounced back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{W-What? Did you see that? What in the world is that cloak?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{I’ve seen several legendary cloaks, but nothing like this...}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Don’t make a big fuss. Stay calm.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, it was funny to be surprised at items.&nbsp;</span><span style>From the very beginning, Grid was the king of being overgeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{No matter how great his items are, he’ll have definite limits.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s control skills were at the level of the low level rankers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Aim at this point.}</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as Grid got within a certain distance, the representatives of Russia formed a triangle shape with Grid in the center, isolating him.&nbsp;</span><span style>They linked skills that made use of the strengths of their different weapons, disturbing Grid and dealing constant damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t that Grid didn’t know their intentions.&nbsp;</span><span style>His intense combat experience amplified Grid’s judgement ability in a positive direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid moved naturally while using Pagma’s Swordsmanship, avoiding the Russian rankers’ non-targeted skills. This made the Russians feel astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Avoidance skills?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t know.&nbsp;</span><span style>Over the past year, how hard Grid had been working to defeat stronger enemies and how much he developed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Grid gave them despair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Restraint.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wide area CC was activated in an instant, causing the Russians to look contemplative.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid swapped from Braham’s Boots to Grid’s Boots to raise the destructive power even more, and dealt a blow to them.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this moment, commentators, experts and viewers around the world were thrilled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Pagma’s Swordsmanship, it had an obvious weakness! The footwork is needed to use it. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 In fact, in last year’s National Competition, Grid was hit by a few rankers using this weakness. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 But this year's Grid is different! He uses the skill while moving! Grid has learned how to avoid this weak point! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Overcoming weaknesses and sublimating weapons...! It’s really amazing! Really great! Grid is actually a genius! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was more than two years since Grid was exposed to the world.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t a short amount of time, and at last, the world started to see Grid’s true value.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A true top class.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘A monster was hiding on this small island.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Chinese representatives were upset.&nbsp;</span><span style>They ignored Japan as a small country.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yet Katz’ strength was incredible. It was more than they predicted.&nbsp;</span><span style>Meanwhile, Damian was also very surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He’s above the average level of Overgeared.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Genius at fighting’ Hao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The best person in China, whose population was over 1.3 billion, his strength was unrivalled.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, he had excellent control skill over secondary weapons like chains.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian thought that Hao was equal to the top members of Overgeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet the more surprising thing...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Katz is the same as Hao.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Blood Breath!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dragon Fear!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was like a Hollywood blockbuster movie.&nbsp;</span><span style>As the magnificent and destructive confrontation between Hao and Katz deepened, the environment became worse.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian used a wide range protection spell so that his teammates wouldn’t be hurt by the damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What will be the outcome?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Chinese representatives stood arrogantly, believing only in Hao’s strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, the Japanese were nervous that Katz would be defeated by Hao.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, Japan couldn’t wait any longer and moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t fight head on. Retreat and fight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>China boasted the best power in Asia and their average level was higher than Japan by 15. There were three third advancement classes.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment that Yoshimura and the Japanese representatives were being pushed back by the momentum of the Chinese representatives.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't run away and fight. Divine Protection, Incarnation of Light, Goddess’ Blessing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damain used various buff skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Divine Protection increases the defense of you and your party by 20% for 3 minutes.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Light Incarnation increases the attack power of you and your party by 10% for 3 minutes.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Goddess’ Blessing increases you and your party members’ stats by 10% for 5 minutes, negates one strike and will create a shield that absorbs 8,000 damage.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The effect was comparable to the buffs used by priests.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, the effects of Goddess’ Protection was beyond imagination, causing the Japanese rankers to feel shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Katz was also impressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He isn’t the pope for nothing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Blood Warrior had a passive blood-sucking effect, so his battle endurance was very good.&nbsp;</span><span style>With Damian’s buffs and healings, Katz would be able to hunt infinitely.&nbsp;</span><span style>Katz decided that he would surely turn Damian into his own person after the National Competition ended. He didn’t doubt it, because he believed in his wealth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hao groaned because he couldn’t adjust to Katz’ rise in stats.&nbsp;</span><span style>It happened when Katz smiled triumphantly and was going to link a combo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shed Weapon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hao showed wonderful control through a different skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>He accurately grasped the orbit and speed of Katz’ sword, grabbed it and dropped Katz’ weapon to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your weapon ‘Crave’ has been released!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This is the result of a skill. You won’t lose ownership of the item. In 12 seconds, the item will return to your inventory.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘My weapon was forcefully removed?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he couldn’t pick up the sword that fell to the ground, he wouldn’t have a weapon for 12 seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hao hit Katz’ chest and shoulders and used another skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shed Armor!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Shit!”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Once his armor was caught in Hao’s hands, Katz cursed as he felt the worst result.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Hao’s sword tore through the single piece of cloth and pierced his abdomen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s up to here.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hao wanted to finish Katz off completely.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he was worried about Damian’s intervention. While Katz was flinching, Hao stepped back and examined the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hiik!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of the screams came from the Chinese representatives.&nbsp;</span><span style>China was completely shaken by Japan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Pope...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Along with the fraudulent buffs, Damian occasionally used offensive magic and healing magic.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was showing off the ridiculous abilities of the first pope user, standing there with a laidback expression, like an old man who was drinking alcohol.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Japan is a strong team this year.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were also a candidate to win.&nbsp;</span><span style>Japan felt stronger than any country that Grid and the Overgeared members belonged to. It was almost like Russia or the United States.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thus, Hao had a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why? If you have this much power, why aren’t you absorbed in the target processing? Why abandon getting a medal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian responded like it was obvious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t Grid participating in this? Rather than losing and lowering the morale of the team, it’s better to give up on this event.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hao had no direct experience with Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He’d only witnessed Grid’s videos in the past, so he couldn’t understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel and Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why did people who he acknowledged keep overestimating Grid?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The puzzled Hao became shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style>The only object of his awe, the score of the Russian team that Kraugel belonged to, completely stopped, while Korea’s score started to rapidly accelerate.</span></p>
