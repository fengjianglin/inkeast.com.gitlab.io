 <p><span style>Chapter 107</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The 13 series, released by Company B in the second half of this year, was the best visual medium sized sedan of the series.&nbsp;</span><span style>The curves were smooth, sleek and balanced, with the bumper that emphasized simplicity. It deserved praise for blending sports and force at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style>The low body contrasted with the high back. The silver muffler was one of its important charming points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 800 million won car, highly acclaimed for its design in a prominent magazine, was now mine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuoh... Really cool.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of my house.&nbsp;</span><span style>I was impressed as the car arrived.&nbsp;</span><span style>The matte black color gave it an even higher quality feel. I wanted to drive this car on the road right now.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was obvious that everyone would focus their attention on this top of the line car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I wanted to call out to a beautiful woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Hey, hop in!’ This was what I wanted to yell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 13 series was a car that any woman would want to ride in, so I was confident that I could easily succeed in hunting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But hunting will be for later. First...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I started the car.&nbsp;</span><span style>The heavy and powerful roar of the engine made my heart pound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, the engine of the 13 series was considerably downsized compared to the 12.8 series. Unlike the 12.8 series which was a super sedan, this was inevitable since the 13 series was more design than power oriented.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nonetheless, it had a monster performance of 580 horsepower, a maximum torque of 72kgm and a 0-60 of 3.8 seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style>The 13 series could also be called a super sedan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let's go!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>I prepared to depart in 23, the name of the car.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Buwaaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>An amazing power and speed that reached 100km less than four seconds after starting!&nbsp;</span><span style>I was weak at driving, but this was a perfectly comfortable ride!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ohhhh! Amazing! 23, you are really great! Puhahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This situation seemed like a dream, so only a happy laugh emerged.&nbsp;</span><span style>I was a debtor a few months ago, but now I was the owner of an 800 million won car!&nbsp;</span><span style>I was truly an example of reversing my life!</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was filled with pleasure. My wish had been fulfilled. It was all due to Satisfy!&nbsp;</span><span style>Satisfy was a fantastic game worthy of its name.&nbsp;</span><span style>I appreciated the fact that the virtual reality game, which could never be imagined in the past, was launched in this age and gave me such success.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Young Ladies High School was a female only high school and among the top 10 schools in the nation.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was established less than 50 years ago so its history was short, but numerous females who graduated from there had accomplished a great deal in all walks of life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And the fame of the Young Ladies High School was at its peak this year.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was due to two schoolgirls, Shin Sehee and Park Yerim.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were two people within the top five scores of the national mock tests, and their beauty was superior to celebrities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Firstly, Park Yerim.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was always smiling. Her eyelashes were long enough to shade her eyes, and the moistness blurred them, making her give off a decadent feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a mole under her left eye and a thick lower lip. The overall impression combined with her soft and pale flesh was enough to arouse people’s imaginations. She was a typical example of a drawing. She had a sex appeal that made it hard to believe she was a high school student.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In addition, she wore her uniform skirt short and undid a few buttons to emphasize her chest, so her fellow peers couldn’t sleep while thinking about her. Some adults seriously considered that they might be pedophiles because of her, causing them to consult a psychiatrist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By contrast, Sehee was a very neat girl.&nbsp;</span><span style>She always looked calm and composed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her eyes were big and round, and a distinct stubbornness was felt from her closed lips.&nbsp;</span><span style>She just looked beautiful. She had a balanced blend of features and long straight hair. She had the ideal appearance of someone’s first love.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Satisfy had Yura and Jishuka, South Korean high schools had Shin Sehee and Park Yerim. The presence given off by the two girls was unique.&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to that, the streets in front of the Young Ladies High School were packed daily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She came out! Sehee!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh! Yerim as well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The front entrance of the Young Ladies High School.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was this place really a girl’s high school? It was natural to question this because many male students were gathered in front of it. The males were only interested in two girls, Sehee and Yerim.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were gathered to see the faces of Sehee and Yerim.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a daily sight.&nbsp;</span><span style>The students of the Young Ladies High School naturally didn’t mind that boys from other schools were gathered.&nbsp;</span><span style>The only one suffering was Sehee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Revolting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee was honestly frightened.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was lucky that the school employed a lot of security guards so the boys weren’t able to turn into a mob.&nbsp;</span><span style>She just wanted to go to school as usual, and was angry about why she had to suffer this type of situation when she wasn’t a celebrity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Yerim was different. She enjoyed this situation, unlike Sehee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aren’t there any nice oppas~?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Yerim said to Sehee as she looked around at all the excited boys.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do it in moderation. Isn’t it tiring to have all these people come every day?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yerim didn’t feel uncomfortable about Sehee’s nagging. Rather, she laughed and hugged Sehee’s waist.&nbsp;</span><span style>“But isn’t it funny? Take a look at them. Don't you think they look like monkeys? It’s like a zoo.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...It feels more like we are the monkeys.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two girls who were completely different except for their good grades!&nbsp;</span><span style>But both of them had been friends since middle school.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their personality and tastes were so different that the two of them were able to fit well without any conflict.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee knew a lot about Yerim. For example, Yerim’s tastes and her family history. She even knew intimate details about Yerim’s intimate details.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee didn’t know because she wanted to know. Yerim wanted to get closer to Sehee and started confiding everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the contrary, Yerim knew little about Shee. Sehee never really talked about herself. In addition, she seemed to have no interests besides studying.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was only one. Her oppa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘She looks like a completely different person when she talks about her oppa.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee was indifferent to the opposite sex. She didn’t know the names of any idols, unlike her peers. What type of person was Sehee’s oppa?&nbsp;</span><span style>Yerim started her habit of badgering Sehee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sehee~ I’m going to visit your house today. Huh? Okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her eyes curved and she shook her chest.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was enough to transcend even gender and make the other person blink. But Sehee showed no reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hing ~ Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don’t like it, so I don’t want to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I want to go to my friend’s house! Fulfill my wish!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She started complaining and whining. But there was no effect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>A cold wind blew out of nowhere.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee walked forward, while Yerim chased behind her.&nbsp;</span><span style>It happened when both girls were walking through the front entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Se~hee~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Emerging from the hundreds of students in front of the Young Ladies High School...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh? What, that person?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yerim’s always smiling face stiffened.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because the man in front of her was too unpleasant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The worst...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those who had a slightly less than average appearance could make up for the shortcomings with style. But this man seemed completely indifferent to style.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was wearing a brown sweater, green sweat pants, white socks and brown slippers. He had a 5:5 parting that didn’t suit his angled face, making this the worst appearance Yerim had ever seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I-I feel like puking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How can he leave the house looking like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pale-faced schoolgirls moved away from the man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please send support to the front entrance. There is a very suspicious man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was he a patient who escaped from a mental hospital? The guards hurriedly radioed for reinforcements.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the male students cried out with outrage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How dare this dirty trash block Sehee’s way!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing? Get rid of that bastard quickly! Don’t let Sehee breathe the same germs as him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 10 security guards couldn’t endure the anger of the 100 male students.&nbsp;</span><span style>The boys broke down the barricade and rushed towards the man.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>A momentum that seemed like they could kill him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-What? What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the man seemed like he was going to die, Sehee’s words made them all astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is Oppa doing at my school?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Heok? O-Oppa?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Yerim misunderstood and hugged Sehee tightly.&nbsp;</span><span style>“No Sehee! That bum is your boyfriend? I can’t accept it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“B-Boyfriend?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A beautiful girl like Sehee was dating someone like this?&nbsp;</span><span style>Everyone was confused.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Sehee turned red as she shouted towards Yerim,&nbsp;</span><span style>“W-What do you mean by boyfriend? He is literally my oppa. My family member.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was also shocking.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why was Sehee’s oppa so ugly? Wasn’t it normal for him to resemble Sehee?&nbsp;</span><span style>The most shocked person was Yerim.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"T-That is your oppa?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee always had a pleasant smile on her face when she talked about her oppa. So Yerim only knew Sehee’s oppa as a good person. She had wanted to meet him for a while. Since Sehee never allowed her to meet him, her curiosity was amplified. After that, her fantasy grew until Sehee’s oppa was a prince on a white horse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But what was this?&nbsp;</span><span style>He was a homeless person in Seoul, not a prince on a white horse!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yerim was unimaginably disappointed. Then the girls jealous of Sehee started to gossip among themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you hear? That person is her oppa.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"They don’t resemble each other at all. Sehee must’ve had plastic surgery. She is so beautiful that I had wondered.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Of course it is plastic surgery. Do you think that a person can be such a perfect beauty without any help? It is the same for Yerim and the famous Yura~.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man who became the centre of confusion! Sehee’s oppa and the best blacksmith in Satisfy, Shin Youngwoo pressed the button of the remote control he was holding.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Buaaaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The 13 series was equipped with a automatic operating system that sensed the remote control, and it stopped in front of Shin Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-Wow!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 13 series was a hot topic since its launch, so even the most ignorant student knew about the car.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was also the 199 limited edition model!&nbsp;</span><span style>As the students and guards admired it, Shin Youngwoo opened the driver’s door and said to Sehee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hop in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Yerim waved her hand,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Yes~ Oppa!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yerim’s eyes were shining.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He is Prince Charming on a black horse, not a white one!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m tired.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>On this day, Sehee, known for her beauty and her ability to study well, had an oppa who made the other girls jealous. She became a wall that they could no longer cross, ensuring a peaceful school life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And Youngwoo drove through the city with Sehee and Yerim.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kiyoooooh~!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kyaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a rough drive. The other cars gave way every time the 13 series appeared, so the three people were able to experience the miracle of Moses.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo and Yerim kept screaming, and Sehee finally decided to enjoy this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the drive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo asked the two people to style him in a manner that suited him.&nbsp;</span><span style>His hair was cut short in a way that highlighted his angular face, making him appear more masculine. The long bangs made his face seem prettier.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t exercise, so a long coat covered up his body, making it look not bad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oppa is tall like Sehee, so the long coat makes your arms and legs look good. Your skin tone is on the darker side so this color..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo smiled with satisfaction as he watched Yerim.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I’m happy that Sehee had a pretty and good friend like you. I’m relieved. I hope you take care of Sehee in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? Ah, yes...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her first impression of him was the worst, but now he was completely different from his first image.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was Yerim’s first experience of meeting a ‘successful adult man’ so she couldn’t help blushing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee’s complexion became worse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is why I didn’t bring her home.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The night deepened as Youngwoo shopped and ate with two beautiful girls, to the envy of all men around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid connected to Satisfy all morning to make items. Then he dressed in the clothes that Sehee and Yerim bought him the day before and entered 23.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was 30 minutes until the reunion began.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His first reunion in two years.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo was nervous, but more excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have changed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t his pathetic self from the past anymore. Shin Youngwoo’s was confidence due to all the recent events.</span></p>
