 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>I desperately wanted to make just 80,000 gold, but what was this? Forget 80,000 gold, I could earn millions of gold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah, truly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An item made from materials contaminated by a foreign substance was completed with a legendary rating!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I thought I would be lucky if it didn’t have a garbage rating... Well, it’s strange. Is this a dream?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no sense of reality because it was an unexpected result.&nbsp;</span><span style>I pinched my cheek to make sure.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then I spoke with certainty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t a dream.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I could barely believe it, but it was reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What type of person was Shin Youngwoo?</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was an icon of bad luck during my 27 years of life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During elementary school, I went on a school trip and was abducted by someone, so I had no pleasant memories. When I was in middle school, I went on a graduation trip and witnessed a hit and run. I had a tendency to get an upset stomach during athletic meets or picnics, never picked up 100 won on the street and there were exactly 89 times when I was hit by local gangsters or school bullies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During my university days, I was dragged into volunteer service and was hit by a hit and run on the way back. I had to pay three million won for hospital expenses and when I was hospitalized, I almost died from food poisoning. But the other patients didn’t receive food poisoning. In the end, they concluded that I secretly ate outside food and got food poisoning, so I didn’t receive any compensation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that time, I really only ate the hospital food. It was still a mystery why the other patients were fine while only I got food poisoning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The hospital’s rice was dirty or the other patients didn’t eat hospital food...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But was it really possible for every patient except me to not eat hospital food? Maybe it was the work of a terrible ghost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyway, those weren’t my only experiences. When I was in military service, the battalion commander would emerge drunk every time I was on guard duty. The battalion commander was crazy from stress and would shout at me to relieve it. Then I remained the youngest in the platoon because my successor didn’t enter. Three days before the last vacation, an accident occurred during training and my successor was injured and hospitalized. Thanks to that, I had to work through the holidays.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were countless other terrible experiences. On the other hand, the number of happy experiences was small enough to be counted on five fingers. &nbsp;One of those happy experiences was eating double portions of rib eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘When I was 13... My grandfather gave me money, stating I was his only grandson... At that time, I had four servings of rib eye that I ate alone...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was truly pathetic.&nbsp;</span><span style>One of the best experiences of my life was eating meat!&nbsp;</span><span style>My 27 years of life were terrible with barely any joy.&nbsp;</span><span style>But what about recently?&nbsp;</span><span style>The symbol of bad luck was transforming into a symbol of good luck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was glad about this change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I believe my mother has been going to church and the temple to pray these days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My family had always been non-religious and I was the same. So I seriously worried that I was unlucky because I didn’t have a religion.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lately, my mother left the house on weekends and seemed to pray to God and Buddha for her son.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mother, thank you...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tears of joy emerged.&nbsp;</span><span style>I realized I wasn’t alone in this world as I became surrounded by my mother’s love. My body and mind became warm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Ibellin arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s the time you mentioned. Has Thorn been finished?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I threw the Thorn of Deep Grievance towards Ibellin.&nbsp;</span><span style>And...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Cough!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ibellin’s breath was blocked.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ibellin checked the Thorn of Deep Grievance and was so surprised that he forgot to breathe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough cough! T-This? Grid! Is Grid a bugged user?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I heard all types of things.&nbsp;</span><span style>“A bugged user? What nonsense are you saying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“B-But...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ibellin had no idea what to do as he twisted his hands together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve heard that blacksmiths are limited to making unique items! I know that legendary items can only be dropped in a raid, so how did Grid make a legendary item? It is impossible unless you are an operator or a bugged user!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t calm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>As I frowned at the confused Ibellin, a woman appeared at the entrance of the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up Ibellin. Don’t fall down just because of this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Jishuka.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Thump, thump.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She approached me while Ibellin tried to calm down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Strange?’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gulp.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>I gulped nervously.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka’s appearance seemed sexier than usual as she said, “Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y-Yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka’s cheeks were tinged red. She looked at me gently with moist eyes, making my heart beat faster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why is she so sexy today?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I looked into her eyes for one second and was literally seduced.&nbsp;</span><span style>I avoided the gaze of the world’s sexiest beauty and stepped back. Then Jishuka came up to me, her hot breath touching my face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s impossible to do these things in Satisfy unless you have a legendary class... Isn't that right? Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You, do you have a legendary class?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I never thought I could hide my identity forever. I didn’t feel the need to hide my identity anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style>I had decided to open up the moment I made a legendary item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You saw it right away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka’s eyes lit up like lanterns.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Indeed...! Grid! You're really the best!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Heok!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Again.&nbsp;</span><span style>She hugged me tightly again. My soul seemed to leave my body as I was surrounded by her body and scent.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now I didn’t misunderstand her behavior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is her way of expressing pure joy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But due to her innate sexiness, that innocent joy was hidden.&nbsp;</span><span style>Maybe she struggled because of this part about herself.&nbsp;</span><span style>I ignored the excited Jishuka and reached out to Ibellin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How much?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The calm Ibellin lifted a finger.&nbsp;</span><span style>“One million gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Were my ears wrong?&nbsp;</span><span style>As a legendary item, shouldn’t it be at least two million gold?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ibellin explained as I was feeling confused.&nbsp;</span><span style>“As described in this item, the ‘Blood Owner’ is me. This means this is my exclusive item. In other words, no one can use this item except for me. So unfortunately, I have to lower the price even if it’s a legendary item.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ibellin, normally acted as a boy with a guileless face, but he became an adult according to the circumstances.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'His image has changed. He didn’t become a ranker for no reason.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was impressed by this Ibellin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The performance of this item is top-notch, but the monetary value is unfortunately low. To be honest, one million gold is a high price. Later on, this item will become useless when I can equip higher levelled items. It’s an item that no one else can use, so I can’t sell it... I’m sorry but it is a severely limited timed item. But that doesn’t change that fact that it is a great item necessary for me right now. I also don’t want to disappoint Grid, so I am willing to pay up to one million gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were no objections.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ibellin’s words were reasonable.&nbsp;</span><span style>The current Ibellin wasn’t trying to haggle. He was telling the truth.&nbsp;</span><span style>But this truth wasn’t acceptable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I raised three fingers.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Three million. I won't accept anything less than that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huh? &nbsp;G-Grid? I understand, but...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I shook off Jishuka and approached Ibellin. Then I took the Thorn of Deep Grievance from him and equipped it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Due to your class characteristics, you have equipped Thorn of Deep Grievance.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A penalty is applied because the item conditions aren’t met.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Eh?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ibellin was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style>Looking at the conditions of use, it was an item only he could equip. But unexpectedly, I was using it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Syuok!</span></i> <i><span style>Syuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>I gently swung the Thorn of Deep Grievance a few times. I nodded like I was very satisfied with the exquisite weight.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then I looked at Ibellin with slight impatience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three million. Are you going to buy it? If you don’t buy it at this price, I won’t sell it and will just use it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eeeeeeek~~~~~~~~~~~~!!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>A scam! Ibellin’s scream echoed through Khan’s smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Thorn of Deep Grievance hates and curses you.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Thorn of Deep Grievance hates and curses you.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Thorn of Deep Grievance hates and curses you.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the meantime, the same notification windows repeated without end.&nbsp;</span><span style>I felt like I was sitting on a thorn cushion, but I was outwardly as relaxed as possible while Ibellin made his decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Two million...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“2,300,000...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am going.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“2,500,000! Please sell it for 2.5 million! This is all the money I’ve saved from working hard from my L.T.S. days and the broadcasting fees! Please!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... Sigh. I guess it can’t be helped. I will concede, since we’re part of the same guild.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"T-Thank you!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I have one condition. Give me a deposit of 80,000 gold right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huh? &nbsp;Ah, yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was sufficient, considering the Sword of Self-transcendence. I didn’t want to see any more damages.&nbsp;</span><span style>Above all, I was the only legendary item creator that all of Satisfy’s users wanted. The guild members were no exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[80,000 gold has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>I wanted to quickly buy my car.&nbsp;</span><span style>I smiled at Jishuka and Ibellin before logging out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First, I deposited 700 million won in my father’s account.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“H-Heok! Youngwoo! What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Pay off your debt first. Use the remaining money to stabilize the store... You don’t have any employees these days, so haven’t you two been working hard alone?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Youngwoo...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't misunderstand. This is a reasonable amount of money for your hard work, so don’t worry about it. Do you believe me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sob sob! Oh my~~ !! Our spoiled son has become such a wonderful man overnight! This is like a dream!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t a dream. Don’t worry, it isn’t a dream.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Youngwoo! Sob sob sob!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My mother embraced me and cried. These days, I was being inundated with my mother’s tears. Meanwhile, my father just dropped his head without saying anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I should’ve acted better sooner...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>My parents paid the expensive tuition fees for me to go to university, but I played a game instead of getting a job. Then I became a debtor at a young age, disappointing my parents.&nbsp;</span><span style>My parents had suffered for several years because of me, so I once again vowed to treat them better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That afternoon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After buying the 800 million won sedan, I was scolded by my mother, who told me I was still immature.&nbsp;</span><span style>It hurt like hell, but I felt relieved as I felt the strength in my mother’s hand.</span></p>
