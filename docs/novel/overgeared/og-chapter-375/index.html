 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The influence of the 1st National Competition was enormous.&nbsp;</span><span style>The average worldwide ratings surpassed 63%, overwhelming the audience of existing competitions like the Olympics and the World Cup.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a natural phenomenon.&nbsp;</span><span style>The number of people who played Satisfy or engaged in Satisfy related businesses was in the billions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I read an article about the economic effects of the National Competition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>S.A. Group’s director of operations, Yoon Sangmin.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was directly facing Shin Youngwoo, one of the busiest people in the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The S.A. Group really appreciates the possibility of developing the National Competition. We want to broaden the influence of the National Competition every year, and have decided to make a biggest investment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cafe XX in Geumcheon-gu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shin Youngwoo drank coffee while listening to the story and Yoon Sangmin smiled confidently at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We will be offering unparalleled benefits to the participants of the National Competition compared to last year.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to convince me, Shin Youngwoo, to participate in the 2nd National Competition.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo opened his mouth for the first time.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Please persuade me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He finally showed some interest.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yoon Sangmin was relieved and started the briefing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's simple. We will increase the value of each medal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The value of the medals wasn’t high in the 1st National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>The governments just paid the medalists a prize money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But from the 2nd National Competition onwards, the S.A. Group will also give a reward. We will give special items to the medalists.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is the performance of the items?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t have high expectations.&nbsp;</span><span style>He thought it would be an epic~ unique rated accessory.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Yoon Sangmin’s reply was unbelievable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Since Pagma's Descendant is in the blacksmith category... You will be able to acquire the god mineral adamantium. The more high value medals you get, the more adamantium you can obtain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"!!!!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style>Adamantium!&nbsp;</span><span style>As the best mineral in the world, it didn’t have a will, but its performance was comparable to pavranium.&nbsp;</span><span style>Adamantium was also the material of the Holy Light Set, which Pagma had produced in the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m not sure how to obtain it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as he could secure adamantium, he would be able to design more diverse and powerful items. It was a reward that he couldn’t miss.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yoon Sangmin watched Shin Youngwoo shake and gave a meaningful smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A small provocation is needed.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yoon Sangmin had been observing Shin Youngwoo for almost a year. He knew how to handle Shin Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, gaining medals won’t be an easy task. The 2nd National Competition is a lot different from the 1st National Competition. It is virtually impossible for South Korea, a country weak in Satisfy, to aim for a medal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shin Youngwoo’s eyes turned cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Himself, Yura, and Peak Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>The strongest members of Overgeared were gathered in South Korea, yet it was still classified as weak?&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t tolerate it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rather than patriotism, his self-esteem was leader of Overgeared was stimulated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Shin Youngwoo of the past would’ve declared that he would participate in the 2nd National Competition right now.&nbsp;</span><span style>But.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There is a reason why I didn’t put my name on the participants list until the last moment.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the 1st National Competition, Shin Youngwoo won three gold medals and placed South Korea third in the overall rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style>The world was paying attention to what he would do in the 2nd National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, Shin Youngwoo was a ‘symbol’ of the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Lauel gave me advice.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ask to be treated as a symbol.&nbsp;</span><span style>South Korea and the S.A. Group would do their best to contact him, so please stand firmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Director Yoon, let’s clean this up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shin Youngwoo’s expression and tone were completely calm, unlike what he expected.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yoon Sangmin felt surprised, but he was a talented person who became a big business executive at a young age. He didn’t reveal his psychological state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Speak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Director Yoon Sangmin said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give permission for the Overgeared Guild to do the opening for the National Competition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shin Youngwoo made a ridiculous demand.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted them to hand over the opening of the event, which would be watched by billions of people, to specific users?&nbsp;</span><span style>This was going too far!&nbsp;</span><span style>If Shin Youngwoo was an ordinary ranker, Yoon Sangmin would’ve scoffed and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Shin Youngwoo was a person whose personality and intelligence developed through Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Shin Youngwoo was a good example of Satisfy, so Yoon Sangmin listened to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What’s the reason for your absurd request?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guild promotion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? Guild promotion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was going to use the opening that billions of people would watch in order to promote the guild?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doesn’t Overgeared already have a reputation as one of the best guilds? I don’t think you need marketing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The issue is that we are one of the best guilds. Overgeared should be a unique and exclusive guild.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, Shin Youngwoo was representing Lauel’s opinion.&nbsp;</span><span style>In Satisfy, the ultimate content was to have a kingdom.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the first place, Overgeared was an organization designed to make Youngwoo king.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to build and defend a kingdom, they needed to have strong national power. And in order to advance, they needed to prevent the invasion of foreign powers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were many forces beside the seven guilds that could threaten them. The opening of the National Competition was a means to show off the majesty of Overgeared and to deter the ambitions of others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was hovering around Youngwoo’s head.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was this being too serious towards a game?&nbsp;</span><span style>This question was funny.&nbsp;</span><span style>Satisfy was a huge ‘cash’ game.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he set up a kingdom, he could accumulate wealth beyond imagination. It was natural to be serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Soccer players and basketball players, sports which are less popular than Satisfy, are earning hundreds of billions of won a year.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was reasonable for Satisfy players to sit on a pile of money.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The opening of the 2nd National Competition was to provide a spectacular sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Against the backdrop of Paris, France, seven players representing each country formed a group and acted out a specific situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>The overwhelming CG and story stimulated the people of the world, while the world’s best rock band celebrated their 30th anniversary by singing the opening song.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The opening that S.A. Group’s marketing team planned.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was cancelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>S.A. Group’s executives.&nbsp;</span><span style>Several dozens executives gathered together with Chairman Lim Cheolho.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The opening that Grid proposed isn’t bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the first place, the opening that our marketing team produced was vague when it came to the order of appearance for each country.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was because the venue was Paris, so the French team should being the opening. However, the United States was ranked 1st in the 1st National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The order of the appearance of Grid, who won three gold models with his own strength, was also vague.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Grid’s opening was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rather than emphasizing the nationality of the National Competition, the focus was on individual traits and Grid could clearly be called the symbol of the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the intentions were impure.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of the 224 National Competition participants, 43 of them belonged to Overgeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>Those people would do the opening with Grid. It was like a promotional video for Overgeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was resistance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are already rumors that our group is supporting the Korean rankers like Grid and Yura. This will just give the media around the world an excuse to latch onto.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The purpose of the National Competition is to turn Satisfy into a sport. The aim is to encourage the people of each country to immerse themselves in the game while cheering on their teams. We should focus on the countries, rather than individuals.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a debate.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it eventually tilted to one side.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was due to Yoon Sang-min's remark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid has declared that he won’t participate in the National Competition unless he’s given the right to direct the opening.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He played a dominant role in the 1st National Competition and later on in Satisfy, the main character who constantly raised a topic.&nbsp;</span><span style>If the best star of Satisfy didn’t participate in the National Competition, it was inevitable that the popularity would drop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s a problem that we can afford. Whether or not Grid participates in the National Competition, the average audience rating is likely to be no different from last year.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nevertheless, there was a separate reason for Yoon Sangmin and some executives to stick to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But the story changes with Kraugel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 1st ranked Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>His popularity was higher than Grid, and he had the title of sky above the sky. His fans were at the level of fanatics.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unfortunately, he never once made a public appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If Grid competes in the National Competition, Kraugel will also participate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Humans with the word ‘best’ attached to them had something in common.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their pride was huge.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel wanted to face Grid on the world stage of the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If Kraugel participates in the National Competition, the power of the 2nd National Competition will overwhelm the first one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There wasn’t a single executive who denied Yoon Sangmin’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was decided.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>『 The 2nd National Competition will take place in 43 days! Kraugel, Grid, Zibal, and Chris will be participating, as well as many more countries than the 1st National Competition’... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 A total of 32 countries are participating in the 2nd National Competition, and the events are open to the public. Compared with the 1st National Competition... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Today, when the 2nd National Competition is 42 days away, the opening video was released through the Internet and worldwide broadcasters! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 The opening video, which is causing hot repercussions through the public, is well received because it expresses the characteristics of each player representing the countries. But at the same time, it is also being criticized. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 The title is called the National Competition, yet it is more focused on the participants than the countries. But... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 This brilliant video that lasts 4 minutes and 31 seconds is enough to make everyone’s heart beat faster. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>♬-</span></p>
 <p><span style>It started with the thrilling performance of the rock band, which had been popular for 30 years.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Syuong~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A red meteor flew across the dark blue sky.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The camera shook with distant explosions.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ssik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A black haired and white skinned man filled the screen.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Grid’s Blackening state.&nbsp;</span><span style>The camera rapidly rotated around him, revealing the members of Overgeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>The viewers cheered as Yura and Jishuka, dressed more beautifully than ever, appeared behind Grid’s shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, it showed players from various countries, including Zibal and Chris.&nbsp;</span><span style>Before they knew it, the camera reached someone staring up at the red comet.&nbsp;</span><span style>The man had a neat beauty that couldn’t be believed, the sky above the sky, Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lone Kraugel and Grid, with 42 colleagues, exchanged a glance.</span></p>
