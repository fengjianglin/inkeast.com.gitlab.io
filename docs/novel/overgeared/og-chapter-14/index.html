 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Once I finished my 280th piece of firewood, my hunger became worse and I started to become dizzy. However, I didn’t stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I wouldn’t be me if I gave up at this point.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since childhood, I had never been good at anything. I wasn’t smart, wasn’t handsome, and my personality wasn’t good. I wasn’t even good at sports or exercising. I didn’t have a special talent in a single field.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>I had no abilities, felt severe jealousy towards others, and made excuses...</span></p>
 <p><span style>I couldn’t deny that I was a bad representation of the human race.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the reason I was able to build amicable relationships in high school was through my persistence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I wasn’t very smart. I needed to study several times more than others just to maintain a normal grade.&nbsp;</span><span style>My personality was bad. I often put on a charade that was just as good as the politicians.&nbsp;</span><span style>I wasn’t good at exercising. During PE, I was able to play soccer with others because I tried diligently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I knew this about myself, so I tried. I did my best to not give up.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to my persistence, I was able to go to university and make it safely through the army.&nbsp;</span><span style>I might be debt-ridden because of Satisfy, but I barely managed to maintain an ordinary life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyway, persistence was my strong point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Level... money...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was caught by this obsession and didn’t stop moving my axe.&nbsp;</span><span style>I had just chopped the 460th piece of firewood when suddenly, a notification window popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Persistence stat has been opened.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Surprisingly, it was a new stat. I immediately checked the stat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Persistence]</span></p>
 <p><span style>You never give up, even in the face of a difficult task. You won’t get tired easily. The possessions weight limit has increased. The feeling of satiation will last for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The higher the number, the higher the effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Stat points can’t be distributed to this stat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Every time 10 points are gained in this stat, the ‘Indomitable’ stat will increase by 1 point.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&nbsp;“Wow!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I wouldn’t tire easily, my weight limit would increase, and satiety would last for a long time!&nbsp;</span><span style>It was truly fantastic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Furthermore, my indomitable stat would go up by one with every 10 points in persistence?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to be persistent to raise this stat?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I felt some doubt as I returned to chopping the firewood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I showed a lot more persistence when completing Ashur’s quest... why wasn’t the persistence stat created until now?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I could only think of it as the difference between a normal rank class and a legendary rank class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It might be the same actions and same effort, but the stat growth rate of a legendary class is higher than a normal class.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once I discovered the new benefits of the legendary class, I forgot all of my fatigue and started to chop the firewood with more determination.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttaak!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttaak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As the number of firewood increased, I developed the knack of hitting the firewood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite hitting along the grain, the durability of the axe decreased by one point every 200 pieces of firewood. However, at a certain point, it no longer decreased and the speed of my chopping accelerated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time I finished 1,000 pieces of firewood, I had four points in the persistence stat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You haven’t consumed food in a long time, so all stats have dropped by half. It is easier to become affected by an abnormal state. If you continue to starve, your health will gradually decline.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a close call.&nbsp;</span><span style>I was lying breathless on the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pant pant...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My knees were weak and my arms were heavy. My whole body was screaming in pain, making it hard to move.&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite the compensation from the persistence stat, my -3 level stamina was still poor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I had chopped firewood for only six hours, but I was exhausted.&nbsp;</span><span style>I ate the bread and water that I took out of my inventory and looked towards the east where the Grey Forest was located.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The raid party should’ve arrived at the Guardian of the Forest by now. It is good that I didn’t join the party... I would’ve been disgraced if I joined.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>With my -3 level stamina, I wouldn’t even have been able to follow the movement speed of the other party members.&nbsp;</span><span style>How embarrassing would it have been if I died from exhaustion, not by a monster?&nbsp;</span><span style>I shook my head as I recalled my premature attempt to join the party.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'When I think about it, I don’t even know the drop rate of blue orichalcum. My thinking was too simple when I tried to join the party. I should think and act more carefully.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It felt like I had a small amount of mental growth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, I barely recovered and returned to Smith’s smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I finished chopping the firewood. I did as much as possible and managed to obtain 1,000 pieces.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Smith burst out,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Puhahahahat! A newbie like you chopped 1,000 pieces of firewood in six hours? You aren’t just a newbie, but a liar as well! Are you trying to deceive me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He laughed like it was funny and glared at me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is this person bipolar?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I pointed towards Smith’s backyard.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Isn’t it too much to lie that I chopped 1,000 firewood in six hours? If you don’t believe me, why don’t you go and check it directly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t have to tell me that. If you cheat me, I’ll kick you out of here straight away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I followed Smith towards the backyard.&nbsp;</span><span style>After a few moments...&nbsp;</span><span style>Smith’s mouth dropped open as he saw the 1,000 firewood piled up on one side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“H-How is this possible...? How can someone like you cut 1,000 pieces of firewood so quickly? They’re also perfect...! No, the amount of time isn’t the problem. You don’t have the stamina to chop 1,000 pieces of firewood! Tell me honestly! Where did all this firewood come from? Did it come from Vans carpenter store? Or did you buy it from the woodcutter who lives in the mountains? Foolish guy! I asked you to chop the firewood yourself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What? Why are you framing someone? These are my own logs of firewood!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ridiculous! It can’t be!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was this person senile? Why didn’t he believe me?&nbsp;</span><span style>I picked up the axe. Smith flinched and stepped back as he saw it in my hands.&nbsp;</span><span style>I set up a log.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttaack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>My woodcutting technique had reached the peak after chopping 1,000 logs of firewood. As soon as the axe met the wood, a clear sound was heard.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a thrilling sound that rang through the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smith marveled at the sound and then looked surprised when he saw the log split neatly in two.&nbsp;</span><span style>After staring blankly, he nodded and opened his mouth,&nbsp;</span><span style>"I thought you were an ordinary newbie, but you’ve actually worked for a long time in woodworking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then, you’re a woodcutter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No.”&nbsp;</span><span style>I reached out a hand towards Smith, who was talking nonsense.&nbsp;</span><span style>"First, give me the compensation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Umm... Yes. The work is better than I expected, so I will give you more compensation than I promised...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doubt could still be seen in Smith’s eyes, but he pulled out 40 coins.&nbsp;</span><span style>At that moment, the quest completion notification window stated that I received 15 experience points.&nbsp;</span><span style>The way that Smith gazed at me also changed considerably. Before, he had looked at me like a cockroach, and now I was like a mutt on the streets?</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was proud.&nbsp;</span><span style>I had felt helpless in the successive S and SS-grade quests, so completing a normal quest after a long time gave me a sense of accomplishment.&nbsp;</span><span style>As I was bathing in the afterglow, Smith gave me a pickaxe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you climb the mountain, there will be a mine. Gather iron ore from there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How much?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As much as possible!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Mine Iron Ore]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Difficulty: E</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blacksmith Smith is suspicious of you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He keeps looking and looking, but Smith can’t understand why you are better at chopping firewood than him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smith has greatly increased the difficulty of the task in order to assess you properly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Conditions: 80 pieces of iron ore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Reward: Affinity with Smith +30, experience +55, 20 bronze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Failure: Affinity with Smith -30.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>55 experience!&nbsp;</span><span style>If I cleared the quest, I would go up three levels at once and finally get rid of the minus level. I was happy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, wait.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘Other people start at level 1, while I’m glad about reaching level 0...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I felt strange as I accepted the quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I placed strength in the hand holding the pickaxe.&nbsp;</span><span style>I had a huge passive skill that was understanding items. If I took advantage of this, the mining job would be done without difficulty.&nbsp;</span><span style>I left the smithy without delay. As I headed to a small mountain in the back of the village, I asked a child passing by.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kid, do any monsters emerge on that mountain?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was he eight years old? The kid with the runny nose shrugged and replied,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Are you really asking that question? How can there be monsters on a mountain attached to the village? My dad says that the lord’s soldiers patrol this area for our safety. So you don’t have to be a shivering coward, Traveler.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“C-Coward? Me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The spiteful expression and nasty tone!&nbsp;</span><span style>A nasty kid who provoked the urge to punish him.&nbsp;</span><span style>As I prepared to rub my fist on the child’s head, I saw a big man, probably the child’s father, approaching.&nbsp;</span><span style>The man looked between me and the boy with a disapproving expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Boy, why are you hanging around that traveler? He looks stupid, so don’t associate with him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. I only replied to him because he looked so pathetic and frustrated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huhu, my son had to go through a lot of trouble. By the way, how did a traveler like that come to our village? Our village isn’t a place that lazy people can enter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right. But he asked me a question and I didn’t want to be rude.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahahat! Yes yes. Then let’s go to eat. Your mother is waiting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes Father!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The father and kid walked away.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dammit, now I was being ignored by a kid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is too much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The NPCs’ attitude towards me was disturbing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>During the level 1-10 beginner days, the NPCs didn’t show a favourable opinion towards users, but they still taught us and helped us grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>However, they unconditionally ignored me now that I was a minus level. They felt irritated just making eye contact with me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>My reputation might’ve increased by 500 in exchange for discovering Pagma’s Rare Book, as well as the dignity stat after changing classes, but the minus level itself seemed to have the worst affinity with NPCs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Then Doran was a really nice person.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I preferred a NPC like Doran, who mistook me for a high level. He forced me to accept the quest, but at least he didn’t ignore me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘When I think of Doran, I’m reminded of Doran’s ring.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I still mourned the thought of the loss of Doran’s ring.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>I gazed at the sky for a moment and soothed my mind. I checked my status window before moving to the mountains.</span></p>
