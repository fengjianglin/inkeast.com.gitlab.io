 <p><span style>Chapter 287</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>There was a mysterious person following Grid’s party.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had long arms, thick lips, and impressive skin that was as black as charcoal.&nbsp;</span><span style>His name was Kasim.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The last descendant of the Nero people destroyed by the Saharan Empire, and the ultimate assassin with the title of ‘King of Shadows.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hrmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kasim had observed Grid from before he became a duke.&nbsp;</span><span style>He always maintained a distance of 5m from Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Recently, he had to increase the distance to 7m thanks to the skills of the young assassin called Faker, but it wasn’t a huge hindrance.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was still a large difference between Kasim and Faker’s skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Vampire city...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kasim found out the destination of Grid’s party.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vampires.&nbsp;</span><span style>A branch of the demonkin, they lived in the human world rather than in hell.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their strength was overwhelming.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was natural since they were designed to hunt humans.&nbsp;</span><span style>Entering their lair was an act of suicide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'In particular, the problem is the True Blood clan. Duke Grid can deal with a viscount but...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t a match for earls yet.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kasim was sure of this because he had a firm grasp of Grid and the Overgeared members’ power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'If they meet an earl, they will all be wiped out.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Should he stop it?&nbsp;</span><span style>No, that wasn’t necessary.&nbsp;</span><span style>Based on Kasim’s observations, Grid and his companions were all immortal cursed existences(users).&nbsp;</span><span style>The cost of death for them wasn’t big.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Sometimes defeat is a good medicine.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t that right? Doran.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had fought thousands of times and a defeat in one spar didn’t always mean victory in the next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...I miss you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doran. A friend who grew up together under the same mentor.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why did Grid have the ring Doran inherited from their mentor?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Kasim questioned. He was following Grid to figure out why.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It didn’t take long to figure out why.&nbsp;</span><span style>All his questions were answered after finding out that Grid was Irene’s husband.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nevertheless, the reason he stayed with Grid was because he saw the possibility of Grid growing to rival the Saharan Empire.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Saharan Empire!&nbsp;</span><span style>They persecuted the innocent minorities and wiped them out if they refused to submit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kasim had a huge grudge against the empire.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to watch Grid one day destroy the empire.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suruk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kasim disappeared. He would stay by Irene’s side until Grid came back.&nbsp;</span><span style>Nothing should grab Grid’s ankle while he was growing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Kasim planned to thoroughly protect Irene, who Grid loved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro was working in the fields, Asmophel training soldiers, and Kasim was hiding in the city.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Reidan was much safer than when Kraugel had been here. It was an impregnable fortress unless a dragon or great demon attacked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Administrator Rabbit could develop the city with confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In a few months, we can finally escape from a the deficit. I have to slowly raise the labor costs to increase the efficiency of the workers. Is it enough if I raise it by 0.1%?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was unaware of this, but there were many positive people around him.&nbsp;</span><span style>All of this was created by Grid’s changes and growth, so he should be proud.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[The giant worm has been destroyed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[2,330,900 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The desert toad has been destroyed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[2,607,400 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is great.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They headed to the vampire cities.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s group slayed desert creatures as they moved forward.&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword marvelled from among them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘</span><span style>These monsters give too much experience. I can’t adapt.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The desert monsters gave at least 20% more experience than the monsters on the top floor of Cork Dungeon.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, it didn’t take long to hunt them.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was absurd.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the reason why the Overgeared members monopolized the top rankings after Grid was appointed as lord of Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The vampires will give a lot more experience than the desert monsters. Maybe I might achieve level 307 in this expedition.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword didn’t think that entering the top 10 was a dream.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Grid was full of complaints.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'The experience is too low.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most users raised their levels by hunting or quests, but Grid was a special case who raised it through raids.&nbsp;</span><span style>So it was natural for him to complain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Considering that the knights and elders of the Rebecca Church gave tens of millions of experience, and Pascal gave 700 million experience, the two million of the desert monsters was terrible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘When can I reach level 300?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagma’s Descendant didn’t have the concept of second or third class advancements.&nbsp;</span><span style>But at level 300, his stats went through the third awakening like any other user.&nbsp;</span><span style>Since Grid had unusually high stats, he would be dramatically strengthened the moment he reached level 300.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He dreamed of that day, but Grid was currently only level 296. His experience gauge wasn’t even half full yet.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was sighing when he suddenly recalled the Reputation Store.&nbsp;</span><span style>He broke through 30,000 reputation after obtaining the ‘Sealed Ability’ hidden piece and was able to use the Reputation Store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had looked at it the other day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'There is a potion that gives an experience buff.’&nbsp;</span><span style>What if he took that potion after entering a vampire city?&nbsp;</span><span style>‘I can level up!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid opened the Reputation Store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Reputation Store!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttiring~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[This is a special service for the best in Satisfy!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately after this phrase, a golden carriage only visible to Grids eyes fell from the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was very similar to the golden carriage that occasionally came to front line troops that had no PX (Post exchange).</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was convinced that the inventor of this system was someone who served in the military.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Introducing the luxurious goods to our guest!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Sweet Candy]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A little candy bar!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>A candy with natural sweetness is the best!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>There are no chemicals added!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Effects: When the sweet candy is in your mouth, all stats will rise by 30% for 5 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* This item can only be purchased five times per account.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Price: 20,000 reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It started with the limited-edition products that offered the best performance to...</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Good-looking Sunglasses]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The large frame is the highlight of the square sunglasses!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is big enough to cover half the face, so it will help someone ugly look handsome!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Effect: Look handsome.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The charm stat isn’t created or increased. It is a simple accessory with no special function other than a visual effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Price: 5,000 reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>...Items that had no practical use.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The golden carriage. No, the Reputation Store had around 30 products displayed.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were event-limited products that were occasionally released.&nbsp;</span><span style>In any case, Grid only needed one item right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Where is the experience potion? Ah, found it!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s gaze fixed on a specific produce.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Draw! Draw! Draw everything!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A random drawing machine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the price of 999 reputation, you can get a variety of items randomly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Limited edition items aren’t included.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a certain chance of gaining an experience buff potion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Price: 999 reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'This is great!'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy didn’t have a maximum level, so experience buffs could exponentially increase the gap between users.&nbsp;</span><span style>The experience buff potions common in ordinary games couldn’t be found in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the Reputation Store was a special place.&nbsp;</span><span style>Only a few users could gather such great achievements, so it needed to be attractive to them.&nbsp;</span><span style>That attraction was the experience buff potion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid went over there in a flash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The cost is cheap. Why is it 999 reputation instead of 1,000?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were many 20,000 products in the world valued at 29,990 won.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was a marketing technique to deceive people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is an opportunity to get a buff potion for a low price!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>999 reputation.&nbsp;</span><span style>Considering that he got 150 reputation when making a unique item and 500 reputation from a legendary item, it wasn’t a cheap price.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid judged that it was worthwhile to try and used 999 reputation on the drawing machine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Draw! Draw! You have drawn a product.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chwaruruk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The goods in the machine started spinning.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then after a while.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Rattle!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>An item popped out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Congratulations! Pretty Hairpin has been acquired!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Pretty Hairpin]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A colourful and pretty hairpin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If you gift it to a woman, she will be delighted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 0.1</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the result of losing his mind at the thought of a experience buff potion.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid temporarily forgot about the odds of a game like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Dammit!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blue hairpin was really pretty. It would surely have a great effect with Irene’s silver hair.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, it wasn’t worth wasting 999 reputation on.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid cursed and tried to throw the hairpin away, but eventually put it in his inventory. It would be a gift for Irene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He pictured Irene and his anger calmed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, it is hard for things to happen the first time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second time.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would try a second draw.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid bought another spin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Congratulations! You have acquired the world’s most delicious skewer.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[World’s Most Delicious Skewer]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is a skewer of a hell dog’s hind legs aged for 100 days, then roasted with a secret sauce.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is the supreme taste that gourmet raiders enjoy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's just dog meat!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This! You have failed! Unfortunately, please look for the next opportunity.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is even a failure?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prior to the release of virtual reality games.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid hadn’t experienced the mobile games that most people in the world played.&nbsp;</span><span style>He only played MMORPGs that he could enjoy on his PC.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t know the fear of drawing games, and was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dammit! Bullshit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s anger aimed at innocent creatures.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the way to the vampire city, Grid killed more monsters than anyone else.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even Pon and Regas were surprised at his speedy hunting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid is really motivated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is in a high position, so he feels a strong sense of responsibility.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid has matured even more after the guild merger. Truly wonderful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bias was scary.&nbsp;</span><span style>Filled with misunderstandings, Grid’s party finally arrived at a vampire city.</span></p>
