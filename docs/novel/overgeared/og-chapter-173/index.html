 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Talent, skills, appearance, wealth, and background.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura was born with everything. Nothing was lacking.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s why people thought she lived without ever experiencing a single trial.&nbsp;</span><span style>But that was a misconception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t know all the trails she went through and the effort she made.&nbsp;</span><span style>In fact, Yura had suffered numerous trials and had many frustrating experiences.&nbsp;</span><span style>She tried to withstand the trials and failed. But she was able to mature because she didn’t give in to her frustration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a process that took place in both reality and Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was how she could become 5th ranked and a star that people were envious of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can learn from today’s failure and grow even more.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a flash and weapons aimed at her organs.&nbsp;</span><span style>She closed her eyes and accepted death.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaeeeeeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Something flew from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This..’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura opened her eyes and saw seven beautiful blades.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then a familiar voice was heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The villain has appeared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A powerful and confident voice.&nbsp;</span><span style>That voice was weak just a few months ago. Would anyone believe her if she said that?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The black-haired man wielded his greatsword and proudly showed off his overwhelming strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>The person was Grid!&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the moment when the person who once made Yura very frustrated appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You came. You decided to accept my compulsion.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to her innate talent, she lived a life of solitude.&nbsp;</span><span style>She didn’t have the experience of relying on someone.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ever since her parents died, she was completely isolated.&nbsp;</span><span style>She had a heart of steel because she had to face the world alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But at this moment.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura’s solid heart melted like snow before sunlight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura smiled as she blushed for the first time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her smile was more brilliant than ever.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Tira Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The world’s attention was focused on the small island that was the stage for the target processing match.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A brilliant debut.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the honest impression of Turkey’s representative, Bubat.&nbsp;</span><span style>The young man called Grid appeared and saved Yura just before her death, blowing the rankers away. Then he used the unidentified golden blades to destroy the targets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The appearance was dramatic enough to seem like the main character of a movie.&nbsp;</span><span style>Right now, the outside world would be in an uproar.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was obvious that the ID Grid would occupy the number one spot on the Internet real time searches of each country.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a common question that everyone in the world had.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Bubat asked on behalf of the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid replied sarcastically,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Isn’t it obvious after I saved Yura? South Korea’s representative.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bubat frowned at the words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He doesn’t feel any tension despite being surrounded by renowned rankers. He is an arrogant person.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was certainly a private ranker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A person who hides behind a curtain and doesn’t know the enormity of the world, he believes he is the best frog in the well... I have met many people like you.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The private rankers all had one thing in common.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was that they didn’t know the reality of the world.&nbsp;</span><span style>They mocked the rankers who competed on stage with courage and honor, not realizing it was just an illusion.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bubat had experience humbling such people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You should always be vigilant.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sneak sneak.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bubat fixed his gaze on Grid and moved a few steps with skillful footwork. He narrowed the distance to 3m and used a skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Bull Headbutt!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bull Headbutt was the Crusher’s unique skill and had a higher concept than Blink magic.&nbsp;</span><span style>He leapt through space itself, so he could approach the target no matter what obstacles were in his way.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bubat emerged in front of Grid and used a skill at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style>He bent his waist. Then his hard forehead hit Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura countered Bubat using precise timing, but Grid didn’t have the same control as Yura. He allowed the attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 1,730 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[ The target will become rigid for 0.3 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The target has resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Resisted?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bubat was confused but linked his CC skills out of habit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Star Wish!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bubat’s one-handed hammer hit Grid’s temple.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was the special effect of stars floating above Grid’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 2,280 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The target will be stunned for 2.5 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did it properly.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the power of a Crusher, who could neutralize the enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Well done Bubat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 10 remaining representatives moved in unison.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were intent on killing Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It doesn’t matter who you are!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I’ll make your face distort with pain!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They would force Grid to exit, making his spectacular emergence be in vain.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would go back to hiding behind his curtain as usual, like all private rankers.&nbsp;</span><span style>The rankers ridiculed Grid and prepared to attack him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Danger!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bubat hurriedly exclaimed.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was due to the incredible notification window that appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The target has resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>He saw many people who could reduce the duration of CCs using stats, skills or item effects.&nbsp;</span><span style>Therefore, he didn’t think much of it when he saw that Grid resisted Bull Headbutt’s 0.3 second rigid state.&nbsp;</span><span style>But to be perfectly resistant to a 2.5 second CC?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is he immune to CC?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If so, it was a total scam.&nbsp;</span><span style>A chill went down Bubat’s spine.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the other rankers were confident.&nbsp;</span><span style>They couldn’t imagine that Grid was immune to CC and ignored Bubat’s warnings, swinging their weapons as hard as possible.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Syuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The onslaught revealed their weakness, because they didn’t expect a counterattack.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pisik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid laughed and moved lightly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sukakak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>First of all, he would leave Bubat for later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid evaded the attacks and advanced while counterattacking.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Keook!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was undeniable that Grid’s control skills were lacking compared to a ranker. However, he had experience raiding powerful bosses and he had grown slightly beyond the category of ordinary people.&nbsp;</span><span style>It meant he couldn’t fail to counterattack against the enemies who weren’t vigilant and exposed their weak points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this... Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid, who shouldn’t be able to move, had neatly avoided their attacks and counterattacked.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thus, the rankers were caught off guard and wounded.&nbsp;</span><span style>They hurriedly took a health potion while shock filled their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 6,230 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 6,100 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 6,450 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Putting aside his immunity to CC, his flat damage was this much?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is this guy...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If a ranker received damage from a damage dealer with a level in the mid-200s, they would suffer around 3,000 damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yet this was more than 6,000 damage?&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, this was the damage without using a skill?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You..! What is your identity?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was different from the usual private rankers that they met.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was a monster like Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style>The South Korean team was hiding another bigshot like Yura?&nbsp;</span><span style>The rankers became tense.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this moment, someone saw the golden blades destroying the targets by themselves and belatedly recalled something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That reminds me, those golden blades... Don’t they look like the golden discs used by Pagma’s Descendant at the Bairan battle?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It can’t be...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rankers frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the same time, the commentators were making the same guess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 The seven golden blades are moving by themselves! The actions, material and color are similar to the golden discs used by Pagma’s Descendant! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 We should pay attention to that black greatsword! That greatsword has an orange color around it like the sunset, so I failed to recognize it at first. But look closely! It is the greatsword that Pagma’s Descendant threw to Toon in the Bairan Battle! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come to think of it...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then perhaps...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That man called Grid...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was he Pagma’s Descendant?&nbsp;</span><span style>The millions of viewers around the world, including the rankers and audience members all wondered the same thing.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Grid was frowning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They only lost one-fifth of their health, despite being hit by Dainsleif? They are truly top rankers.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>[+8 Dainsleif (Reproduction)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 500/500 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 703~991 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Speed: -8% (-2)%</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Additional damage equal to 10% of the target’s current defense will be dealt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The greater the number of enemies, the greater the damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>(Additional 15 (+3) damage per enemy)</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The skill ‘Golden Flash’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The weapon was strengthened to +8.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to the +0 weapon, the base attack power increased by 56% and the option effects increased by 20%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Dainsleif perceived 11 people as enemies.&nbsp;</span><span style>This meant that the +8 Dainsleif had an attack power of 901~1,<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9eafa6a7b5de">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> (damage proportional to the opponent’s defense).&nbsp;</span><span style>This alone was enough for it to be a great weapon, so Grid had judged that it wasn’t necessary to bring out Failure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I really can’t ignore the rankers.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid opened his inventory. Then he put Dainsleif away and pulled out Failure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[+9 Failure]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Legendary</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 1,090/1,090&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attack Power: 1,768~3,682 &nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 80 (+24)</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Agility +50 (+15)</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a low probability of blocking the enemy’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a certain probability of activating the ‘5 Joint Attacks’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a high probability of activating the ‘Cutting’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The skill ‘Bisect’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There will be a fear effect if the enemy is more than 20 (-6) levels lower than the user.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Attack power +20% (+6) in dark places.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A +9 item was on a different dimension from a +8 item.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Compared to the +0 weapon, the base attack power increased by 70% and the option effects increased by 30%.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, Failure was a weapon that was fundamentally more powerful than Dainsleif.&nbsp;</span><span style>The absolute majesty of the +9 Failure couldn’t be compared with the +8 Dainsleif.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In the first place, I am participating in the National Competition...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid himself was well aware that it was impossible to conceal his identity anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style>So what if he let the world know?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will have a glamorous debut.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was reluctant to be a celebrity because it was annoying in many ways.&nbsp;</span><span style>But on the contrary, if he could endure it, then he would be able to obtain a lot of benefits.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would become more popular with women. Or he would become more popular with women.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will become more popular with women!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the incident with Ahyoung, he had a distrust of women and couldn’t think of dating immediately. However, he wasn’t celibate.&nbsp;</span><span style>Who knew what would happen?&nbsp;</span><span style>He might meet his fate if he got many female fans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huhuhu...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style>But from the enemy’s point of view, Grid’s smile was very wicked.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“P-Pagma...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s real!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rankers started frantically thinking.&nbsp;</span><span style>The legendary class, Pagma’s Descendant.&nbsp;</span><span style>The person who made the whole world shake was a Korean?&nbsp;</span><span style>And what was that white light around the greatsword?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘+9 sword...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Transcended Link.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was the first appearance of Pagma’s Descendant after the Bairan battle. This was much more powerful compared to the bombardment he fired at Neberius during the Bairan battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 18,050 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 19,900 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 18,410 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuaaaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rankers were hurt due to the battle with Yura, and their health wasn’t full despite taking potions.&nbsp;</span><span style>They couldn’t cope with the blue and white bombardment and started to turn into a grey light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some people who calmly deployed their defense skills survived, but there was only a handful of them.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were only four people left.&nbsp;</span><span style>Except for them, seven rankers were logged out with one skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A wide area skill has this much damage?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Why didn’t he get affected by the CC?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The four survivors were confused by the aftermath of the absurd attack.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Grid didn’t stay still.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Quick Movements!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He pulled out the Ideal Dagger and used its skills, then he chased after the survivors.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he swapped again to the +9 Failure and used Blacksmith’s Rage, raising his attack power and attack speed.&nbsp;</span><span style>A large storm raged from the greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeong!</span></i> <i><span style>Jjang!</span></i> <i><span style>Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[The durability of Zilron’s Sword has decreased by 32.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The durability of Ragel’s Shield has decreased by 19.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The durability of the Tuhon Armor has decreased by 9.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk!</span></i> <i><span style>Peok!</span></i> <i><span style>Sakak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 9,820 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 12,030 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 10,550 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh! What is this...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Every time I defend, my item durability...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dammit! Isn’t this crazy? Kuhak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was this really a player’s attack power?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was comparable to a boss monster.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura was strong in magic, but they couldn’t endure this bastard’s strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then what about the attack speed?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was unbelievably fast for a greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaaak!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was impossible for only four people to cope with Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Somehow they counterattacked, but their damage wasn’t as high as Grid’s. His defense was at the level of a tanker and they couldn’t deal any fatal damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bubat had persistent health and continued to use CC, blocking Grid’s path several times. But Grid was immune to CC, making it useless.&nbsp;</span><span style>A Crusher’s worst counter was Pagma’s Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'How absurd...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A legendary class was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>It didn’t matter about the lack of control.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was just strong.&nbsp;</span><span style>Furthermore, the items he was armed with were too good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is a fraudulent character... Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, the four survivors, including Bubat, died and were logged out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This place is all cleaned up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid defeated 11 rankers that represented their country.&nbsp;</span><span style>He recovered his health by drinking potions and extended his sight to the entire island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>On one side, Regas and Med were having a confrontation.&nbsp;</span><span style>Natasha left Regas alone and was absorbed in aiming at the targets.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka and Samuel who represented Brazil were in the forest.&nbsp;</span><span style>The US, French, Chinese and Japanese representatives were busy keeping each other in check.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All those who met Grid’s eyes shrank back.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka and Regas weren’t an exception.&nbsp;</span><span style>Right now, they were Grid’s enemies.&nbsp;</span><span style>They all stayed silent and couldn’t act carelessly, causing Grid to shrug.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Well, there is no need to fight.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Peng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In the sky above.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even at this moment, the seven golden blades were moving on their own to destroy the targets.&nbsp;</span><span style>South Korea’s points were now at 110.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, the average score of the other teams was only 70 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This status quo just needed to be maintained, and it was clear that South Korea would win.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 ... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The commentators were overwhelmed at the majesty of the legendary class and couldn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hundreds of thousands of spectators were silent with astonishment. The Olympic main stadium was as calm as dead rats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the millions of people watching via TV or the Internet had lost their souls.&nbsp;</span><span style>Had there ever been such a quiet day since the human race started breeding on Earth?&nbsp;</span><span style>Many people were feeling doubt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed, you truly are Pagma’s Descendant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was still beautiful despite being wounded.&nbsp;</span><span style>She couldn’t raise her slender body, so Grid approached her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don’t exaggerate and stand up. Isn’t it funny that a woman like you has fallen down?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Please help me.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura asked and held out a hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Che.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid clicked his tongue and grabbed her hand.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was clearly caught on camera.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W... Waaahhhhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid! Grid! Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yura! Yura! Yura!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Korean audience members started to cheer on the two people.&nbsp;</span><span style>South Korea, a country ignored for being weak in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>This man and woman were about to end that long disgrace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On this day.&nbsp;</span><span style>A true legend began.</span></p>
