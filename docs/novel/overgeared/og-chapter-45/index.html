 <hr>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>Winston Castle’s dungeon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>I was trapped in a solitary room on the third underground floor, but was rescued by Euphemina and was now looking for Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Damn! I’ve looked everywhere, but I can’t find him. Where is that bastard Huroi trapped?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“I don’t think he is on this floor. Maybe we should go down further?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“What? The third floor isn’t the end?</span></p>
 <p><span>"According to information I received, there are four floors.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"I have to go down to the fourth floor...”</span></p>
 <p><span>The time limit for rescuing Huroi was 1 hour and 10 minutes.&nbsp;</span><span>I was becoming more and more irritated. If I exceeded the time limit and failed to rescue Huroi, I would receive a really big penalty.&nbsp;</span><span>I had to find and rescue Huroi as quickly as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span>But Winston Castle’s dungeon was very large and the corridors were as complex as a maze, making it difficult to find the way.&nbsp;</span><span>I decided to follow Euphemina’s opinion, but it wasn’t easy to find the stairs heading down to the fourth floor.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hey, you! Are you sure that the fourth floor really exists? The third floor isn’t the end? Maybe Huroi is on the second or first floor...”</span></p>
 <p><span>"I swept through the first and second floors while looking for you, but I didn’t see a prisoner called Huroi. And the fourth floor really does exist. I received the information from a trustworthy person.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"Uhh... But I can’t see the way down to the fourth floor...”</span></p>
 <p><span>"Stop whining. I’m annoyed.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“...Yes, sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Time continued to pass while we wandered around.&nbsp;</span><span>Before I knew it, there were only 50 minutes remaining.&nbsp;</span><span>Meanwhile, the pursuit of the soldiers didn’t stop and there were traps installed in the corridors.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘But I’m glad. The traps are so obvious that I don’t need to worry about falling for them.’</span></p>
 <p><span>This prison was made of rocks.&nbsp;</span><span>The floors, the walls and the ceiling, everything was made of rocks.&nbsp;</span><span>In addition, it was underground, so sunlight couldn’t reach it.&nbsp;</span><span>In other words, it was a space where blades of grass couldn’t grow.</span></p>
 <p><span>But funnily enough, I saw places on the floor where flowers and grass were growing.&nbsp;</span><span>In addition, there was fruit and bread hanging from the ceiling.&nbsp;</span><span>There were also high-quality items that didn’t match the prison space hanging on the walls.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was clearly an unnatural sight!</span></p>
 <p><span>‘They are all traps.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Even a person with the intelligence of an elementary school student would be able to notice such ridiculous traps.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I think you should bow. Otherwise you might die.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span>I listened to Euphemina’s voice and hurriedly bowed down.&nbsp;</span><span>At the same time, sharp arrows flew over my back.&nbsp;</span><span>I checked the arrows stuck in the wall and cried out.</span></p>
 <p><span>“H-Heok...! W-What is this all of a sudden? I was almost hit.”</span></p>
 <p><span>As I was wiping at my sweat and sighing with relief, Euphemina pushed me in the back.&nbsp;</span><span>Due to that, I lost my balance and fell down, while a spear shot up where I was just standing.&nbsp;</span><span>If Euphemina hadn’t pushed me, I would’ve been skewered by that spear.</span></p>
 <p><span>I got goose bumps.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Hik! Hiyaaack! What the hell is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span>"I'm sorry. I accidentally activated a trap.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Euphemina giggled while walking. There were several colorful flowers in her hands.</span></p>
 <p><span>...This was crazy.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Isn’t it strange for flowers to grow in this place? It’s obviously a trap! So why did you pick the flowers? Eh?! How can you fall for the trap, you dumb girl!? I almost didn’t make it! And why would you pick flowers in this situation in the first place? Dammit! Useless person. If I died because of you, I would make you take responsibility. Don’t do anything unnecessary and just find the way!”</span></p>
 <p><span>..That was what I wanted to yell at her, but I didn’t.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Patient, be patient.’</span></p>
 <p><span>I barely suppressed my anger.&nbsp;</span><span>Euphemina had great skills compared to her fragile appearance.&nbsp;</span><span>Her combat skills were equivalent to Blood Witch Yura.&nbsp;</span><span>In addition, she had an epic class that only three people had.&nbsp;</span><span>I didn’t dare mess with such a great person</span></p>
 <p><span>Most of all, her strength was needed to rescue Huroi.&nbsp;</span><span>I couldn’t afford to rescue him with just my strength.&nbsp;</span><span>No matter how wrong she was, I needed to continue flattering her.</span></p>
 <p><span>“B-Be careful. I can’t use defensive magic like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Yes~ yes~ I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Euphemina apologized to me in an insincere manner.&nbsp;</span><span>I was once again infuriated.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This woman! How can you act so shameless despite almost killing someone!? Kneel down and apologize right now!”</span></p>
 <p><span>...Was what I wanted to yell.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Patience... Kuoh... Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span>I felt a new sense of anxiety.&nbsp;</span><span>Euphemina was staring at the bananas hanging from the ceiling.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Surely she isn’t planning to pluck such a suspicious thing to eat? Ah, it can’t be. She isn’t a monkey...’</span></p>
 <p><span>At that moment!&nbsp;</span><span>Euphemina jumped lightly and grabbed a banana.</span></p>
 <p><span>No, why?</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Crack!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Immediately after Euphemina grabbed a banana hanging from the ceiling...&nbsp;</span><span>The floor where I was standing started crumbling.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Kiaaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span>I barely escaped from danger by rolling my body to the side, and finally couldn’t resist yelling at Euphemina.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“What are you doing now? Why are you eating bananas in this situation?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Euphemina answered with the banana in her mouth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“</span><em><span>Chew chew.</span></em> <em><span>Gulp.</span></em><span>&nbsp;I just wanted to eat a banana because there was a banana in front of me.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"Look, it’s just plain common sense! It’s odd that bananas are hanging in this dungeon. It’s clearly a trap!”</span></p>
 <p><span>"Isn’t it strange for it to be a trap? The bananas could be hanging for patrolling soldiers to eat when they’re hungry.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Euphemina sighed.&nbsp;</span><span>"You poor person. You live by looking at the world from a very negative perspective. I bet you don’t have any friends to confide in.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span>I was sure of it.&nbsp;</span><span>Euphemina was clearly very angry. So she deliberately triggered the traps.</span></p>
 <p><span>'I can understand.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Euphemina had come to rescue me because of a quest that would benefit her.&nbsp;</span><span>But rescuing Huroi had nothing to do with her.&nbsp;</span><span>Her current actions were complaining that she didn’t like rescuing a person unrelated to her quest.&nbsp;</span><span>That’s why she purposely triggered the traps!</span></p>
 <p><span>‘She has a temper...’</span></p>
 <p><span>Indeed, it was rare for a beauty to have a good nature. Most beauties were sheltered like princesses.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘But Ahyoung is pretty and has a good nature.’</span></p>
 <p><span>My heart felt cleansed as I was reminded of my ideal love, Ahyoung.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Ahyoung... I want to see you...”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Over here! Those people are here!”</span></p>
 <p><span>"...You dare disturb my contemplation?”</span></p>
 <p><span>I was drawing a beautiful picture of Ahyoung in my mind when I heard a noise from both ends of the corridor and soldiers quickly arrived.&nbsp;</span><span>There were around 50 people.</span></p>
 <p><span>I sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span>“How come they keep coming endlessly? This is bothersome.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Euphemina snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Bah, aren’t I the one dealing with them anyway? Won’t you just be watching or running away? Don’t you think it is disgraceful to complain when you aren’t doing anything? I can’t understand it when you have that weapon. You should be fighting.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"Fighting? Me? I can’t do that.”</span></p>
 <p><span>I had the unique rated dagger that Euphemina returned to me. Obviously, this dagger’s attack power could easily handle the attacking soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span>But I couldn’t enter battle.&nbsp;</span><span>Why?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>It was simple.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I don’t have any armor.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span>The clothes that I was wearing had absolutely no defense.&nbsp;</span><span>I couldn’t fight against soldiers with no defense!&nbsp;</span><span>At the end of the day, Euphemina was helping me so I could concentrate on rescuing Huroi without fighting.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Even if you don’t have armor, isn’t it easy for you to handle the soldiers?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“No. I’m not as strong as you think. Then... I’ll leave this to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Huh? What does that mean...?"</span></p>
 <p><span>I patted Euphemina’s back and headed towards the hole caused by the trap she had triggered earlier.&nbsp;</span><span>"I'll go and find Huroi first. Hold their attention until then!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“H-Hey!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The confused Euphemina hurriedly tried to catch me, but it was too late.&nbsp;</span><span>I ignored her and dove into the hole.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Ku tang tang tang!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>“Wah!”</span></p>
 <p><span>[You have fallen from a high place and suffered 200 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span>I left the soldiers and Euphemina, falling alone to the fourth floor.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Cough! Cough! Uhh...fortunately, I didn’t get significantly hurt.”</span></p>
 <p><span>I raised my dusty body and moved my gaze to the dusty ceiling.&nbsp;</span><span>The battle between Euphemina and the soldiers had already begun, as flashing lights and the soldiers’ yells were heard.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Good, Euphemina. You’re doing very well~.”</span></p>
 <p><span>If she fought as loudly as possible, the enemies would believe that Euphemina and I were on the third floor, pulling all the defensive troops to the third floor.&nbsp;</span><span>Then the defense on the fourth floor would be relatively poor.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Huhut, I can find and rescue Huroi in this gap. Aren’t I surprisingly smart?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Did I feel bad for leaving the fighting to Euphemina while I rescued Huroi?&nbsp;</span><span>Well, no. My conscience didn’t exist. I was the type to use others if it would benefit me.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Was I worried about Euphemina fighting alone?&nbsp;</span><span>Of course I wasn’t worried. She was the first epic class and so OP that she could use all types of magic spells without chanting first.&nbsp;</span><span>She would survive even if hundreds of soldiers and dozens of knights were her opponents.</span></p>
