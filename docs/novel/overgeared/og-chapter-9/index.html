 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The camera zoomed in on Katz’ sword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hundreds, no thousands of blood vessels appeared on the blade and grew at a fast pace, completely covering the sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Within a short time, Katz’s sword was covered with red blood vessels and pulsated like a living heart. However, the sword’s edge actually became sharper instead of disappearing.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a very menacing appearance. On the other hand, it was also a bizarre and disgusting appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Katz patted the wriggling red sword as if it were adorable.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>-This is my passive skill.</span></i> <i><span style>Any weapon held in my hand would be transformed into this shape.</span></i> <i><span style>When I attack an enemy with this modified weapon, I can absorb a certain amount of health in proportion to my attack power. </span></i><i><span style>Thanks to this, my reliance on potions has greatly reduced and hunting alone has become easier.</span></i> <i><span style>The more I attack, the more I can take advantage of this tremendous hunting speed.</span></i> <i><span style>In addition to this, powerful combat skills were created, so I am able to raise my level quickly.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The reporter, whose face was pallid, continued the interview while ignoring the hideous sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Is an epic class that much stronger than regular classes?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>That is a stupid question.</span></i> <i><span style>Isn’t this natural?</span></i> <i><span style>Even if it was only a rare class, it exerts a special power over general classes.</span></i> <i><span style>I can assure you of this:</span></i> <i><span style>I will rise to the number one ranking sooner or later.</span></i> <i><span style>I have that type of ability</span></i><span style>.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Number one in the top 10 rankings that haven’t changed in the past year?</span></i> <i><span style>All 10 users protect their position and won’t give it to anyone.</span></i> <i><span style>This means that the top 10 rankers are extraordinary.</span></i> <i><span style>Isn’t it too much to declare that you can catch up to them just because of one class?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Was the reporter stupid? The arrogant Katz was going to become upset again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As I expected, Katz started frowning. He looked at the reporter and declared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>You say that it is just because of one class?</span></i> <i><span style>How funny!</span></i> <i><span style>I have a natural talent!</span></i> <i><span style>The class of Blood Warrior is just a means to effectively show my talent!</span></i> <i><span style>Agnus got an epic class much sooner and could only reach 7th place in the rankings. I’ll let everyone know that I am fundamentally different from Agnus!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>According to the rumors, Katz was the son of a leading Japanese conglomerate. This was why he was famous for his high pride.&nbsp;</span><span style>After scaring the reporter who spat the mocking remark, Katz took the microphone from her and declared,</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>-Everybody listen up!</span></i> <i><span style>This Katz will soon be first place in the unified rankings!</span></i> <i><span style>The reason I announced my class today is to make the existing rankers aware of my strength and to make them tremble in fear.</span></i> <i><span style>Kukuk, just wait!</span></i> <i><span style>Sooner or later, I will cast you all aside!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Katz was about to return the microphone to the reporter when he suddenly stopped. Then he asked the reporter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Did you say that this is a Korean broadcasting station?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The reported nodded at the words. Katz smiled at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>This worked out well.</span></i> <i><span style>Tell this to Yura: don’t be so proud of being part of a country that has nothing except for S.A Group</span></i><span style>. </span><i><span style>The era of Korean gaming experts is over.</span></i> <i><span style>I will trample on her, the last pride of the Korean gamers, sooner or later.</span></i> <i><span style>Hahahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The reporter’s eyes were tearful while her face distorted like she was smelling chicken poo.&nbsp;</span><span style>I clicked my tongue while watching Katz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The microphones for broadcasting stations in the game are limited and expensive items. Is he proud because of all his money? Mister natural wealth. But Blood Warrior...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was envious.&nbsp;</span><span style>Drain health skills always showed great efficiency in past games. Furthermore, the combat skills that Katz boasted were powerful skills of an epic class.&nbsp;</span><span style>At first glance, Blood Warrior was a powerful class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t more than me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagma’s Descendant was a production class.&nbsp;</span><span style>Production classes usually didn’t have any attack skills, so it was likely that Pagma’s Descendant was the same.&nbsp;</span><span style>But that didn’t mean I was weak in battle. Pagma’s Descendant was a legendary class that allowed me to go against Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>My status resistance was extremely high, and the immortal mode that lasted five seconds was a scam. It was possible to grow as a huge tanker.&nbsp;</span><span style>But was that all?&nbsp;</span><span style>All equipment could be worn without restrictions. It might be possible to cover the insufficient combat strength with the power of items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"In addition, production classes are money factories.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why were there so many users who chose production classes over hunting?&nbsp;</span><span style>The reason was money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagma’s Descendant was a legendary blacksmith class!&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a goose that laid golden eggs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I make a good item and sell it, I might be able to escape from my debt.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I believed it was a class that could make me hundreds of millions of won.&nbsp;</span><span style>I returned to my room and turned on the capsule. Then I went on the Internet to find information about blacksmiths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a lot of unfamiliar jargon and knowledge to memorize, but I concentrated on studying as much as possible.&nbsp;</span><span style>How much time passed?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>While having another attack of hunger, I entered the living room when I heard a big fuss from the TV.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ‘Breaking News’ subtitle appeared on the TV screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I just received breaking news.</span></i> <i><span style>It is said that the Yatan Temple, located in the northern part of the Eternal Kingdom, has collapsed.</span></i> <i><span style>It is surprising and unusual for a well-preserved temple to collapse overnight.</span></i> <i><span style>What is the story behind it?</span></i> <i><span style>Let’s go to the scene.</span></i> <i><span style>I am Reporter Lee Kyungmin.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The screen shifted from the studio to a familiar place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This place...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A location was illuminated on the TV. It was the Yatan Temple where he resurrected yesterday and met Doran.&nbsp;</span><span style>The huge temple, larger than the Capitol Building, was surprisingly half collapsed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When I saw the scene, I recalled the dark storm caused by Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'That magic... was it huge enough to destroy the temple? She is a really horrible girl to use such a fearsome spell on people.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>My fear of the witch I faced yesterday slowly amplified over time. If we accidentally met on the street by chance, I was afraid that I would pee my pants.&nbsp;</span><span style>Katz said he could beat her?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Bastard. You really don’t know who you are talking about. She is already in a different dimension. A monster.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The male reported conveyed the news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>At around 3:40 a.m. today, a user visited this place and witnessed an amazing sight.</span></i> <i><span style>Korea’s number one ranker, who is fifth in the unified rankings, Yura was fighting someone.</span></i> <i><span style>Who did she fight that she had to use enough strength to destroy the temple?</span></i> <i><span style>Was it a struggle with a top ranker?</span></i> <i><span style>If so, why were they fighting in this place?</span></i> <i><span style>Was there perhaps a hidden quest?</span></i> <i><span style>There are many questions.</span></i> <i><span style>Then let’s listen to the testimony of an eyewitness.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A boy, who seemed to be a middle school student, was caught on camera.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The boy’s ID and level were subtitled at the bottom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The boy spoke,</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Yesterday, I was here because of a quest. I was forced to flee to the temple while being chased by a monster.</span></i> <i><span style>The believers who should’ve been present weren’t there. However, a large commotion was coming from underground, so I went down to the basement...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The boy stopped talking and asked the reporter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Is there a mosaic over my face right now?</span></i> <i><span style>It is time for me to go to school. If my mother catches me in the capsule, I’m dead.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At almost the same time, the boy’s face and ID were completely covered with a mosaic.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reporter nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Of course there is a mosaic.</span></i> <i><span style>There is voice modulation as well.</span></i> <i><span style>Please tell me with confidence.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The stupid boy sighed with relief.&nbsp;</span><span style>Poor guy... his mum would kill him.&nbsp;</span><span style>His unhappiness would be my happiness! I felt better.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The boy continued,</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I went down to the basement and saw Yura.</span></i> <i><span style>I was captivated by her beauty.</span></i> <i><span style>Mister, have you seen Yura?</span></i> <i><span style>Really!</span></i> <i><span style>She is even prettier than Kim Taehee!</span></i> <i><span style>A complete goddess!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>People around the world are already aware of her beauty.</span></i> <i><span style>We will put aside that story.</span></i> <i><span style>What was happening in the basement?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>It was amazing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>What specifically was so amazing?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>There were almost 20 black magicians constantly casting magic at a single person, but he didn’t receive a single point of damage.</span></i> <i><span style>Even the curses had no effect.</span></i> <i><span style>He laughed like he didn’t feel anything and moved towards Yura.</span></i> <i><span style>Yura was nervous.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The reporter was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>The basic level of the Yatan Temple’s NPCs is known to be 160.</span></i> <i><span style>He was attacked by level 160 NPCs and received no damage?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>It was like he resisted all of it.</span></i> <i><span style>Really.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Resisted dozens of spells?</span></i> <i><span style>That is impossible, even for a top ranker...</span></i> <i><span style>Is he ranked higher than Yura?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The reporter’s expression wasn’t happy, but the boy didn’t care and continued speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>He isn’t a top ranker.</span></i> <i><span style>I have never seen the face before.</span></i> <i><span style>Nevertheless, he defeated all of the black magicians and threatened Yura.</span></i> <i><span style>Yura used Dark Storm...no, it seemed like she used every bit of magic she had.</span></i> <i><span style>It was too strong that it even broke the temple, but that user was fine.</span></i> <i><span style>Yura’s expression was disturbed as she stared at him with an expression similar to fear...</span></i> <i><span style>I am a member of Yura’s fan club, so I know that Yura isn’t the type of person to look like that.</span></i> <i><span style>I never imagined that Yura could make such an expression.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The reported looked dubious but still showed great interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>So what happened in the end?</span></i> <i><span style>And what was the man’s ID?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The boy shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>ID...</span></i> <i><span style>Well, that... what was it?</span></i> <i><span style>I can’t remember.</span></i> <i><span style>I was so entranced by Yura’s beauty that I didn’t observe him properly.</span></i> <i><span style>Then I was killed by a falling pillar, so I don’t know the result.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I see...</span></i> <i><span style>Who is the man who dealt with 20 black magicians and Yura, despite not being a top ranker?</span></i> <i><span style>I would like to know.</span></i> <i><span style>This is Reporter Lee Kyungmin.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Unbelievable!&nbsp;</span><span style>The hand holding the remote control shook. My heart started thumping.&nbsp;</span><span style>The man in question on the news, it was me.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was an opportunity. Since this incident happened on TV, I would receive lots of requests for interviews and would be able to make a profit from shooting commercials.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The screen switched back to the studio, with a panel filled with experts discussed the man in question, me.&nbsp;</span><span style>I called the broadcasting station right away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>(Hello, this is BCC’s viewers consultation center. How can I help you?)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The man from the breaking news. Aren’t you looking for him right now? The person who fought Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>(Yes. Do you have a tip?)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The person is me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>(...Ah, yes. As part of the confirmation process, can you give me your Satisfy ID and some brief information?)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My ID is Grid. My class is Pagma’s Descendant and my level is -3. Oh, Pagma’s Descendant is a class obtained from a legendary class change book...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tutu-</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The station one-sidedly hung up and didn’t pick up my call again. It seemed that my number had been registered as spam.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stupid person! You will regret missing out on the scoop of a lifetime!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I wanted to try other stations, but decided to let it go. As I thought about it calmly, I was reluctant to leak information about the minus level and legendary class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t the time yet, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I focused on the TV screen. Then I saw a familiar figure on TV.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doran...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was really Doran.&nbsp;</span><span style>The present TV screen showed a large image of the ruins of the Yatan Temple, with a small box at the top where the experts were discussing.&nbsp;</span><span style>Doran was in the center of the big screen. He was too small so the cameraman didn’t seem to see him, but I was able to recognize Doran.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I pushed my face right in front of the TV and watched Doran quietly.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was barely crawling from the ruined temple, a woman held in his arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The identity of the woman was the earl’s esteemed daughter that Doran had been looking for.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The destruction of the temple caused great confusion among the believers, allowing Doran to somehow rescue her.&nbsp;</span><span style>The woman stood up and screamed something at Doran. She seemed to be crying.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Doran handed something small to the woman. After a short time, he died and turned into a grey light.&nbsp;</span><span style>The woman shed tears and headed elsewhere while cherishing the item she received from Doran.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doran...died...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t a human but an NPC. A false life made by the system.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, it wasn’t comfortable watching the death of an NPC I built a bond with. They had minds and a clear body temperature.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Also, the ring...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I trembled as I recalled the effects of the ring that Doran had worn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When an NPC dies, all their equipment will disappear as well... That ring, if you were going to die anyway, you should’ve given it to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I looked out the window where rain was still pouring down. I didn’t feel well. In addition, I was hungry.&nbsp;</span><span style>After satisfying my hunger, I connected to the Internet again to gather as much information about blacksmiths as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The time was 3:55 p.m.&nbsp;</span><span style>The 12-hour penalty was over.&nbsp;</span><span style>I had to log on to Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Login."</span></p>
