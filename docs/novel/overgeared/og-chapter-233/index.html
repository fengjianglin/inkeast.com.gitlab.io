 <p><span style>Chapter 233</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>It was well into dawn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Mysterious Forest, which looked like the landscape of an Oriental painting, had long been devastated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dark blue paint smeared the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>A man was standing with flames behind him.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had black hair that was thicker than silk and his white skin was dusty and scarred.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dozens of of enemies were reflected in the lonely eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>The humans fell down, got up, and fell down again.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wanted to kill them so they couldn’t fight again, but it wasn’t easy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were getting stronger over time, and there was an excellent human who protected them.&nbsp;</span><span style>He probably showed half the strength of my original master.&nbsp;</span><span style>I couldn’t do anything because he easily overwhelmed me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How long could I hold on?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, a human army came.&nbsp;</span><span style>One day there were countless monsters.&nbsp;</span><span style>I had defended this forest from all types of beings for a long time, but this was my first moment of great crisis.&nbsp;</span><span style>But I soon calmed my mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I had to defend it.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was on the hill beyond this forest.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was the only one who didn’t hate me, when I could do nothing but imitate the image of others.&nbsp;</span><span style>I didn’t remember the last time I saw her, but her warmth was still vivid.&nbsp;</span><span style>I wouldn’t let these intruders make it through this forest to ruin her happiness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the humans spoke a familiar technique.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the same technique used by my original master.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t hard to cope with.&nbsp;</span><span style>I also used the same technique.&nbsp;</span><span style>I was much faster at using the technique than the human, so it was a simple matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The human’s movements changed in the middle.&nbsp;</span><span style>The footwork suddenly changed from Kill to Link.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Link!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man dodged Kill and fired dozens of energy blades.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pit!</span></i> <i><span style>Pipipipipit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>I couldn’t deal with the dozens of energy blades alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, blood spurted from the body of Pagma’s doppelganger.&nbsp;</span><span style>One fifth of my health gauge was lost at once.&nbsp;</span><span style>The human was excited after succeeding in the attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it? You were tricked? Isn’t it amazing? Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was his 83rd showdown with the doppelganger.&nbsp;</span><span style>He changed sword techniques in the middle, and had now become a clever warrior.&nbsp;</span><span style>A brave warrior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wonderful.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro praised him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro truly felt admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The journey from Patrian to Reidan...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro had seen that Grid’s talent was already facing limitations.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was so clueless that he was deemed virtually impossible to teach.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now there was a good teaching material.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s right, it was Pagma’s doppelganger.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pagma’s abilities might not be completely copied, but the doppelganger was far superior to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro gave directions to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>As the battle with the doppelganger continued, Grid gained enlightenment and grew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The mentor gives their student a glimpse of the bowl, a good opponent strips off the limits, and an ideal opponent makes them forget about the limits.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those were his master’s words.&nbsp;</span><span style>An ideal opponent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro also wanted to find it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Just like the current Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grr...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagma’s doppelganger made a sound.&nbsp;</span><span style>He emitted an immensely strong killing intent.&nbsp;</span><span style>He showed extreme survival instincts now that his life was in danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From now on, it is the real battle. Duke Grid, I wish you the best.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After receiving Piaro’s encouragement, Grid stepped forward with confidence.&nbsp;</span><span style>The doppelganger aimed an entirely new technique at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Pinnacle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagma’s Swordsmanship, it was made up of skills that dealt additional damage in proportion to physical damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, most of them were non-targeted skills and often missed.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Pinnacle was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a targeted skill and had an additional option of ignoring the enemy’s defense.&nbsp;</span><span style>The range of movement was proportional to the length of the weapon.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwachak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was the culmination.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an attack that was impossible for Grid to respond to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Holy Light Armor.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the ultimate armor made by the legendary blacksmith Pagma out of the god mineral, adamantium.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it couldn’t boast a complete defense in front of Pinnacle.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid fell down while Piaro was amazed by the manifestation of an amazing sword technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Pagma! The more I see your swordsmanship, the more I want to meet you, not the fake ones...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A blacksmith, but also a master of the sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>The sword technique that could separate the sky and the mountains.&nbsp;</span><span style>Indeed, the best swordsman after Sword Saint Muller...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They are stronger than my current self!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro resented that he was born in this age.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why couldn’t he be born in the same time as Muller and Pagma?&nbsp;</span><span style>If he had lived under the same sky as them, he would’ve been able to stand shoulder to shoulder with them eventually.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there were no such people in the present age.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was alone and stagnant.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment that Piaro was lamenting this,</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Kuk, okay.”&nbsp;</span><span style>A pale green light flashed around Grid’s bloody body.&nbsp;</span><span style>“It was good that I managed to wear Doran’s Ring in advance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid said as he got up.&nbsp;</span><span style>His appearance was normal.&nbsp;</span><span style>The huge wound on Grid’s chest disappeared without a trace, and there were no other signs of injuries.&nbsp;</span><span style>The power of items.&nbsp;</span><span style>The healing of Doran’s Ring was amplified by the Holy Light Armor, completely restoring Grid’s health.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro was shaken.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even a legendary Saintess couldn’t completely heal a dying person all at once, let alone Grid, who wasn’t a Saintess.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttuduk!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttududuk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid stretched his body.&nbsp;</span><span style>He prepared for a new strike.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I can learn it as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagma’s Swordsmanship usually consisted of three to seven steps of footwork.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was extremely simple, but it was possible to unfold the ultimate swordsmanship with this simplicity.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was difficult to imitate Pagma’s Swordsmanship, and it was impossible to activate even if it was imitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it was possible for Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He could make Pagma’s Swordsmanship his own, just by looking.&nbsp;</span><span style>How was it possible when he had no talent?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason was simple.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was Pagma's Descendant.&nbsp;</span><span style>For that reason alone, Grid had managed to learn Pagma’s Swordsmanship after looking at the murals.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now there was a person to teach him the forms of Pagma’s Swordsmanship directly.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was optimal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The heavy weight of Grid’s boots shook the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid expressed the essence of a warrior god with this sword technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Pinnacle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have learned a new skill.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Pinnacle Lv. 1]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A sword that expresses the essence of a warrior god.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deals 700% of your attack power to a single target. This skill will ignore 60% of the target’s armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Usage Conditions: Have a sword type weapon equipped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Mana Cost: 750</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: 3 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an intermediate skill between Kill and Link. It also consumed much less mana and had a shorter cooldown than Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style>The important thing was that it was a targeted skill, unlike Link or Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style>If this skill had been recorded in the murals at Loran Falls, the past Grid would’ve found it much easier to raise his level.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuoooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Failure moved in a half moon shape.&nbsp;</span><span style>The slash covered Pagma’s doppelganger.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the doppelganger was already prepared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Revolve.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A counterattack used at the perfect timing.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pinnacle was caught by the vortex and returned to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The energy blade faced Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Could he afford to endure this attack now that Doran’s Ring was on cooldown?</span></p>
 <p><span style>No.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Revolve.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Revolve Lv. 1]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like the eye of a storm, it is calm and powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It will return all attacks that hit it within 0.5 seconds of casting with 100% of the power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Usage Conditions: Have a sword type weapon equipped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Mana Cost: 2,000</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: 2 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members were exhausted after fighting the doppelganger while Grid was resting.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their eyes watching the battlefield became wide with shock.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro was the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is impossible!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yesterday and today, Grid’s control abilities had made a breakthrough, but they didn’t think it was at the level of counterattacking at the perfect timing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Counterattacking was a difficult technique to do.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was necessary to use the technique in the right place and at the right time to neutralize the enemy’s attack. It was a technique that wasn’t easy to use without making a lot of effort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Grid had succeeded.&nbsp;</span><span style>He reacted to a counterattack with a counterattack.&nbsp;</span><span style>This meant he had predicted the behavior of the enemy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s growth level exceeded everyone’s predicted range.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[The +9 Failure’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘Bisect’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The +9 Failure’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘5 Joint Attacks’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Holy Light Gloves’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘5 Joint Attacks’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 1,375,900 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The doppelganger’s right arm was cut off.&nbsp;</span><span style>The jade sword was separated from its master and fell to the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s eyes became sharper than ever.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If you catch a chance at victory, link the attack!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro’s cry that he heard yesterday rang loudly in his ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ohhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the doppelganger was struggling with losing one arm and his sword, Grid used a skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a skill that surpassed Transcended Link.&nbsp;</span><span style>Linked Kill.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwachak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A shark, the predator that ruled the world’s oceans for 415 million years!&nbsp;</span><span style>Failure tore at the body of the doppelganger in succession.&nbsp;</span><span style>One time! Two times! Three times! Four times! Five times! Six times! Seven times!</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[All of your stamina has been depleted due to the maximum number of Linked Kill blows being triggered.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your stamina will fall to 0 and you can’t move.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s vision blurred.&nbsp;</span><span style>He tried to hold on but eventually collapsed like a puppet whose strings were cut.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then notification windows appeared in his vision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have defeated the Doppelganger of the Mysterious Forest that has existed for 153 years.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[8,450,109 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The party leader ‘Grid’ has acquired 6,300 gold.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The party leader ‘Grid’ has acquired the Guardian’s Necklace.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The party leader ‘Grid’ has acquired the Guardian’s Bracelet.]</span></p>

 <p><span style>[The party leader ‘Grid’ has acquired 6 blessed armor enhancement stones..]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah... Haha...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he checked the time, he had been fighting for 23 hours and 21 minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the meantime, Grid had been defeated 82 times and the Overgeared members had tasted at least 10 defeats.&nbsp;</span><span style>But in the end, the battle was their victory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t lift a finger, so he just lay on the cold dirt floor and laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had gone beyond his limits, so an unexplained pleasure gripped him.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members ran to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"My Lord! Great!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid! You were really cool!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid! You are such a great guy! Hahat! Puhahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laughter echoed in the Mysterious Forest, which had been filled with screams for a long time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pagma’s doppelganger couldn’t help smiling as he heard it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Memories of the past came to mind.&nbsp;</span><span style>The pure laughter in her childhood.&nbsp;</span><span style>The sharp laughter when she was a girl.&nbsp;</span><span style>The tender laughter when she was a young lady...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His vision darkened. He couldn’t think anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the voices of the humans were heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh? He isn’t dead? He’s squirming?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s lost the cloned appearance, but the nucleus of the body is still alive. However, it might as well be dead because there is a huge degeneration in both abilities and intelligence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Should we kill him?”</span></p>
