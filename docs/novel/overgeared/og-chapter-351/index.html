 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"You’re the cause of this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid received an explanation from Piaro and observed the pit in the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>The traces left behind of the battle were impressive.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was able to get an indirect glimpse of the 1st ranked Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He competed against Piaro, who was reborn was a legend.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the previous confrontation, Grid was able to consume only half of Piaro’s life.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then what about now?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can only decrease it by 1/4th.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro had grown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the spar with Grid, he had woken up to the true use of farming techniques. Then after the spar, he gained the bonus of increasing his stats and greatly increasing his skills. There was also the bonus of raising his level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then a person who managed to compete against Piaro?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Even a normal class...’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwack.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid clenched his fists with all his strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>Strange emotions sprang up, making his chest burn hot.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel noticed his silence and apologized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My first impression is bad. I apologize that Reidan suffered damage because of my personal greed. I will pay you back as much as possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person who actually caused the damage was Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Kraugel felt a strong sense of responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He applied for a spar with Piaro and this incident happened, so he thought it was primarily his fault.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid made a snide remark at his sincere apology.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, a good answer deserving of the number one rank. Do you have a lot of money?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An earthquake had occurred in the aftermath of the battle, causing all of Reidan to shake. Just looking at Reidan’s smithy alone, the overall loss of wealth was quite big.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can it be reimbursed by an individual alone? As a close brother to Piaro, shouldn’t you take responsibility?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“M-My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro stuttered.&nbsp;</span><span style>He felt like his lord was more upset than usual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro couldn’t figure out Grid’s heart.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asmophel was different. He could read the emotions in Grid’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Envy and jealousy...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asmophel was born as the second son, so he always felt these emotions.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Grid was displaying it towards Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were emotions that couldn’t be understood by Piaro and Kraugel, who were always the best.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry about reimbursement. Instead.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Shaaaaaah</span></i><span style>-</span></p>
 <p><span style>A clear blue transparent sword appeared in Grid’s left hand and a black-blue greatsword in his right hand.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Failure and Grid’s Greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fight me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wanting to randomly fight?&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel was baffled. He couldn’t understand why things were happening like this.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, this was Grid’s city. Everything here belonged to Grid. Piaro wasn’t an exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Does he mean to isolate me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A death penalty was huge. Should Kraugel interpret it as never stepping foot in this city again?&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel looked grim while Grid pointed Failure at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t think too deeply about it. I am applying for a fair one-on-one fight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A one-on-one match?&nbsp;</span><span style>If so, Kraugel welcomed it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was also a legend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a golden opportunity to win against a legend and complete the ‘Sword Saint’ quest.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Kraugel couldn’t justify accepting the fight. Using a complete strange to clear his quest, his ego couldn’t tolerate it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why do you want to fight me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel’s sentences became shorter. It was natural. Grid didn’t show any courtesies to him, so there was no need to be polite.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are called the top, or the sky above the sky? I want to see if you’re really such a great person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you have the qualifications to get a glimpse of my skills?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You'll find out soon."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid sent a sparring application to Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was Reidan, Grid’s domain.&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite Kraugel receiving a big penalty if he died, Grid applied for a duel, demonstrating that he took this fight seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sehee... No, Ruby. Use healing on him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you going to fight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ruby asked in a testy manner.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was worried about her brother because she had seen Kraugel’s skills. However, she was embarrassed to show her worry, so she looked testy instead.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid prompted her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Be careful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ruby read her brother’s sincerity towards Kraugel and ended up using ‘Hope.’&nbsp;</span><span style>Hope was the ultimate heal that randomly recovers 10~30% of the target’s maximum health.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel confirmed his rising health and admired it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Saintess...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s sister.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel wondered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Territory, family, subordinates, colleagues, and friends.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was it fun to be in such a limited space with the same group of people? Did they need to repeat what they always did in reality in the game?&nbsp;</span><span style>The world of Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was so wide that it would take the rest of his life to explore it.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a user of the game, wasn’t it right to travel around alone, not bound by anything, in order to experience new things faster than anyone else?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee used Hope in succession and Kraugel’s health reached the maximum.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel made a decision and shared his quest information with Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Sword Saint]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Difficulty: SSS</span></p>
 <p><span style>Win against a legend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This confrontation with you might be a help to me. Is it still okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sword saint.&nbsp;</span><span style>Could he give the strongest legendary class to other users?&nbsp;</span><span style>The past Grid would’ve cancelled the fight immediately.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now he was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the leader of Overgeared, a lord, and the father of a child. Eyes were watching him. In particular, he couldn’t take it back with Lord watching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What would Lauel do?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid worried about it for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s also a good thing if you turn into a sword saint because of me. The 1st ranked user owing me a favor, won’t you pay it back one day?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He phrased it in such a way that Kraugel owed him a favor, despite Grid being the one to propose the fight in the first place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"And I don’t think I will lose.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He expressed his dignity with an expression of unwavering confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel replied honestly,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Grid, I have seen your capabilities many times on broadcast. That's why I know it well. You can never beat me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Stop speaking so long.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the time of the Elfin Stone raid.&nbsp;</span><span style>After sacrificing Huroi due to his powerlessness, Grid pledged never to feel so helpless again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will be the best. I will be the best and not sacrifice my colleagues again.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was his dream, whether it was fanciful or not.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will check it through you.'</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Step, step.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid walked out without hesitation.&nbsp;</span><span style>At first glance, it was an ordinary gait, but he was actually using the footwork of Pagma’s Swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was hiding the use of his skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>Two years in real time after Satisfy opened, he was finally using the basics of the game.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Kraugel saw it instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was easy because he had keen eyes and good insight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel sidestepped the legendary skill and counterattacked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Mole Ascension.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Revolve.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagma’s Swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a relatively demanding skill that required taking an average of five steps.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had used it for hours over the years and gradually adapted.&nbsp;</span><span style>The skill was used at an incomparable speed to before, resulting in damage to the unique presence called the sky above the sky, Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 17,500 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white swordsman’s defense was lower than other third advancement normal classes. Moreover, he didn’t wear his gloves because he was afraid they would break if they received further damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Pagma's Descendant was a legendary class that could exert the ultimate attack power. Grid was equipped with the best items.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel’s health was cut by a quarter in a single blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was also due to the title effects and defense, otherwise it would’ve been a fatal blow.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Kraugel wasn’t shocked by Grid’s attack power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I was wounded by a user?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were no users who had touched his body except for Agnus, king of the dead, and the ‘duo’ from Blood Carnival.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel’s eyes sunk.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the moment he recognized Grid as a strong person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“White Light Steps.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Susuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Under the sun, Kraugel disappeared from Grid’s field of view.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Stealth?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid watched carefully.&nbsp;</span><span style>He thought about what to do and pulled out Kenen’s Belt.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s appearance was obscured by the smoke that emerged.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Kraugel still remained calm. He quickly saw Grid’s shape being covered by the smoke screen and stopped his attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Gone?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The puzzled Kraugel stopped as ‘Keen Senses’ sent him a sharp warning.&nbsp;</span><span style>The danger came from behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you use stealth, I will become invisible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid revealed his appearance in a white hooded zipper and swung his greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Pinnacle, fell vertically towards Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘An invisibility cloak, it’s amazing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel laughed to see Grid using such great items so casually. He rotated his body and swung White Fang.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the appearance of his counterattack, Tearing the Sky, whose orbit was limited to going up.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 21,050 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was hit by the powerful skill and his health gauge sharply declined.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel didn’t give him a break. He continuously swung White Fang and seized the momentum.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Chaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘This orbit...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was currently armed with the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch. His high insight and synergy with the item meant he could reach most of the enemy’s attack orbit.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Kraugel’s swordsmanship contained a much deeper orbit than that of Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 3,500 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 3,610 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 3,485 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The wounds on Grid continued to increase.&nbsp;</span><span style>He tried to counterattack with Link, but Kraugel didn’t allow it. He avoided or blocked everything.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the first place, it was almost impossible to hit Kraugel with a non-targeted skill. Kraugel’s control skills were that excellent.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, Grid summoned the God Hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Magic Missile!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Light flashed from four direction and threatened Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid gave Grid’s Greatsword, Failure, and the Doppelganger’s Greatsword to the God Hands, then used Quick Movements. He summoned Iyarugt while rushing forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Over here!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iyarugt gave him the best sword path.&nbsp;</span><span style>The red light shot forward towards Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Kraugel barely managed to respond.&nbsp;</span><span style>He avoided it using the least amount of movements, and counterattacked, stabbing White Fang into Grid’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 8,300 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel thought it was absurd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘His defense is ridiculously high.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was hard to imagine what type of armor Grid was wearing.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid thought it was more absurd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The defense isn’t applied properly because he is only hitting my vital spots.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hitting his vital spots every time?&nbsp;</span><span style>He was like a supercomputer, not a person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Energy gathered around Grid and surged violently like a wave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the precursor of Wave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it wasn’t manifested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel hit Grid’s legs, causing the sword dance to be cancelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Storm Sword.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As Grid stumbled, Storm Sword emerged from White Fang and hit Grid’s chest.&nbsp;</span><span style>Blood spurted from Grid’s chest, while Kraugel leapt forward and attempted to link ‘Meteor Sword.’&nbsp;</span><span style>The God Hands tried to keep him in check but it was wishful thinking. The God Hands’ Sword Mastery skill was still at the beginner level, meaning it was impossible to threaten Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Meteor Sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment that Kraugel had shaken off all the God Hands and succeeded in using Meteor Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Blood Cry.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel’s body shook as a strong wave was emitted.&nbsp;</span><span style>A strong tempest hit him and he lost his balance.&nbsp;</span><span style>As he started to fall helplessly, a flash came from Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>His skin whitened and a black haze of demonic energy appeared around him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The speed of his demonic sword was incomparable to before.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the linkage of Blacksmith's Rage and Blackening.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Grid’s power.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The clouds that were already torn due to Pounding Mortar scattered even more.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the center of it, Grid had stabbed Kraugel’s heart with Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style>Blood spurted up like rain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My Lord!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro groaned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>As someone who was always looking for the best opportunity in a crisis, he managed to counterattack.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>White Fang flew and penetrated Grid’s neck. Even Iyarugt couldn’t see the sword orbit, so Grid couldn’t take advantage of Doran’s Ring.</span></p>
