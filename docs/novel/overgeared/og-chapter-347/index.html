 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The typical profit structure of BJs was through lunar balloons (goods received from viewers).</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, the main source of income for BJs was advertising.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Brands advertised themselves through the BJ’s clothes or accessories. There were also banner ads inserted on the screen and video ads that increased sequentially according to the number of video playbacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A BJ’s advertising revenue increased dramatically depending on the number of viewers and video plays, so the popular BJs made millions of won as monthly revenue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pinnacle of this was Bunny Bunny.&nbsp;</span><span style>After his splendid recovery through the ‘Seven Guilds invasion of Reidan,’ the average number of viewers was 150,000. The viewers were from all over the world.&nbsp;</span><span style>Once the broadcast started, there were a flurry of lunar balloons. The advertising companies also guaranteed him the best treatment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The new broadcast will raise my value even more.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tadak.</span></i> <i><span style>Tadak.</span></i> <i><span style>Tadak.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny sat in front of a computer for three days. He had his meals in front of a computer and reduced his sleep. He concentrated on editing the video while wearing thick glasses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, very nice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny was very pleased with the 10 hour video that was gradually being completed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Ren marching off resolutely.&nbsp;</span><span style>A young knight struggling against the great swordsman, Chucksley.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid appearing in a dramatic moment to overpower Prince Ren’s army.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Reidan soldiers, who turned the royal army into masses of experience.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, Prince Ren fell to his knees before Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid showed mercy to Prince Ren and reigned over thousands of soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a bonus, the farmer who crushed Hurent...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The war footage of the Reidan army and royal army was a blockbuster.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were plenty of spectacular and stimulating sights to make the viewers enthralled. Thanks to Bunny Bunny’s great filming and editing techniques, there was nothing boring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In particular, the finale is the highlight.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid looked down at the kneeling Prince Ren with a haughty attitude.&nbsp;</span><span style>The viewers would realize something when watching Grid say ‘I will forgive your sins.’&nbsp;</span><span style>They would know that Grid was a clever person who looked to the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The ones who mock Grid for only using items will be shut down.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny liked Grid’s character very much.&nbsp;</span><span style>He showed a great dignity as a lord, while showing abrupt speeches and absolute force. He always appeared in dramatic moment and was suitable to be a protagonist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘His appearance is also becoming better.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>His skeleton had been further refined by exercise. In particular, his sharp jawline was now visible.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a subtle difference when actually looking at him, but it was different in the video. This was because elements on the screen could be changed significantly by minor factors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I want to get closer to Grid in the future in order to obtain more opportunities to film.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttiring~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny was putting the final touches on the editing when an email arrived.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was from Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bunny Bunny narrowed his eyes as he checked the contents of the email.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is as thorough as rumored.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel had two requirements.&nbsp;</span><span style>First, pay 40% of all Grid-related proceeds to Overgeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>Secondly, delete the scene where Grid allowed Prince Ren to live.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The profit distribution is more than twice the average...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, it was something he could afford. It was worth spending this much.&nbsp;</span><span style>But why did he want to delete the last scene that would imprint Grid’s charisma onto the public?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why?&nbsp;</span><span style>Bunny Bunny worried about it for a long time before figuring out Lauel’s intentions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Wasn’t Grid framed for killing Prince Ren?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In such a situation, what if it spread that Grid released Prince Ren?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘...Some people might think that Grid stabbed Prince Ren in the back.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be misunderstood that Grid let Prince Ren leave alive, only to chase and assassinate him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is a situation where the person who killed Prince Ren can’t be specifically pointed out. Well, the misunderstanding might be resolved if Grid tries to explain it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was a sensitive issue, so the public might be indifferent to the clarification.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yes, there is no need to scratch at the surface.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny was convinced and started editing the video again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then two days later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The nine hour video of the war between Grid and Prince Ren was broadcasted by Bunny Bunny.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reaction was explosive.&nbsp;</span><span style>It exceeded even Bunny Bunny’s expectations.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>-Wow...</span></i> <i><span style>That knight called Laden has excellent skills.</span></i> <i><span style>Not giving into the enemy until the end for his lord...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>A Named NPC?</span></i> <i><span style>Ordinary players like us can never meet them...ㅋ</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-Chucksley is the real thing.</span></i> <i><span style>He’s a great swordsman</span></i><span style>.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Ohh!</span></i> <i><span style>Grid!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Crazy; Look at Grid;;;</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Wow...</span></i> <i><span style>I never thought he could match Chucksley...</span></i> <i><span style>He’s even giving Reidan’s soldiers experience while dealing with Chucksley ㅋㅋ</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I can’t look away.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I felt it since he hit the Red Knight, but Grid has really improved his control skills.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I agree.</span></i> <i><span style>There is no comparison to the National Competition or the golem invasion.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>What are those golden hands? </span></i><span style>;;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>What Grid ㅋㅋㅋ Does he want to be a thousand-armed person in the future? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Grid oppa has used Blackening.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I prefer the white version.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, there were many people who expressed dissatisfaction towards Grid. Some even showed hostility.&nbsp;</span><span style>They couldn’t acknowledged Grid, who showed poor skills and only relied on items.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now it was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>People felt attracted to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Over time, the users saw Grid growing and ‘wanted to become like Grid someday.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Eh?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The enthusiastic audience watching Bunny Bunny’s broadcast became quiet.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was due to Hurent, who won Prince Ren’s trust and led 2,000 troops.&nbsp;</span><span style>He repeatedly said that he would repay his grudge while moving through the Altes Mountains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Farmers?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>Farmers blocked their way.&nbsp;</span><span style>The viewers were disappointed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>What is wrong with those farmers? ㄷㄷ</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Blocking the front of an army...</span></i> <i><span style>Do they want to commit suicide?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>How poor...</span></i> <i><span style>Pitiful.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>That was the common belief.&nbsp;</span><span style>All the viewers were worried about the lives of the farmers.&nbsp;</span><span style>But what was the real scene?&nbsp;</span><span style>2,000 soldiers were defeated by a farmer who used a legendary wide area skill. They should be worried about Hurent.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Eek?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Huk!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Heeeok...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At present, the number of viewers for Bunny Bunny’s broadcast had reached 300,000.&nbsp;</span><span style>The first user to become a duke, Grid, and the prince of a kingdom were fighting. It was a hot topic that caused the audience interest to explode.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As hundreds of thousands of viewers watched, Hurent was defeated by a farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was hit in the forehead three times by a hand plow and became a rag.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a shocking event that would cause a wave beyond the legendary ‘5 second logout’ incident.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The world was in an uproar for a while.&nbsp;</span><span style>News related to Grid was played unceasingly in South Korea as well as the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Duke Grid has the strongest soldiers!!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;The crazy farmer of Reidan wasn’t a rumor. He actually exists.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Even the farmers of Reidan are strong... What is Reidan’s strength?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This war hasn’t revealed Duke Grid’s real power. Jishuka, Regas, Pon and the other Overgeared members didn’t participate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid’s actual power must be several times stronger than what was shown here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Various media and public opinion was concentrated not just on Grid, but Grid’s forces.&nbsp;</span><span style>Numerous experts rated Grid’s power as two or three times what was shown.&nbsp;</span><span style>But they didn’t know.&nbsp;</span><span style>Two times? Three times?&nbsp;</span><span style>How funny.&nbsp;</span><span style>After merging with the Silver Knights Guild and obtaining Yura, Grid was 10 times stronger than what he showed in the war.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s strength was increasing by leaps and bounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s build a temple for Goddess Rebecca in Reidan."</span></p>
 <p><span style>14th Pope Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style>The first user to acquire the status of pope was trying to start his first foreign activity after stabilizing the church.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The spacious fields of Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent hadn’t been able to stretch his back for hours already.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was no time to breathe, thanks to Piaro’s thorough supervision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don’t bend your knees when bowing your back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, Piaro had too many unnecessary requirements.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent was exhausted and he couldn’t bear it anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t bend my knees when bowing my waist? Isn’t that too hard? It’s complete torture!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hard work is the way you train your body. If it’s easier, your body won’t be trained and you might be hurt in the long run.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent was confused.&nbsp;</span><span style>Wasn’t he a prisoner?&nbsp;</span><span style>But he was being trained rather than treated as simple labor.&nbsp;</span><span style>In fact, the rewards for the ‘★Hidden Quest★ Fun and Exciting Training!’ was of immense value.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you being so good to me?&nbsp;</span><span style>Do you plan to make me Grid’s subordinate?&nbsp;</span><span style>It won’t work.&nbsp;</span><span style>I will never be Grid’s subordinate. My goal is to make Grid kneel within four seconds.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro explained to Hurent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In one week, I will be heading into Altes Mountain to do a mass-scale land clearing. My goal is to train you as much as possible by then to make you the best labor force."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Dammit. I knew it. You wouldn’t do this for no reason.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent grumbled but followed Piaro’s instructions.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t help it when looking at the quest reward.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment he was immersed in the rice planting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s been a long time, Brother.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A man with his face and name deeply covered by a straw hat arrived.&nbsp;</span><span style>He walked across the fields in a leisurely manner and gave a friendly greeting to Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have grown!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro was a crazy farmer who attacked people for no reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don’t know who he is, but I feel sorry for him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent shook his head.&nbsp;</span><span style>The man with the straw hat. The foolish man who greeted Piaro was attacked.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro’s hand plow attacks were quick and irregular.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even an aura master couldn’t match it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent predicted that the man in the straw hat would have his forehead struck by a hand plow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the result was different from what he expected.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A beautifully shining white sword easily blocked Piaro’s hand plow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That crazy farmer’s hand plow could be blocked?&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent was astonished while Piaro cried out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You have far exceeded my past self...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were only two people who had ever made Piaro feel thrilled.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pagma's Descendant Grid and White Swordsman Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>The identity of the man in the straw hat was the 1st ranked user, Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’m stuck at the last wall blocking my ultimate goal. I’m asking for a spar with you in order to break that wall.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The peak of two billion users and...</span></p>
 <p><span style>A unique existence who gobbled up all types of titles.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was trying to get ahead of everyone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And on this day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the historic first meeting between Grid and Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a turning point for both men.</span></p>
