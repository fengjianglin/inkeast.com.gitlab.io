 <p><span style>Chapter 361</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[You have entered the 20th island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok... Heok...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s complexion was haggard as he gasped for breath.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was natural.&nbsp;</span><span style>He’d spent a total of 45 hours and 19 minutes breaking through 19 islands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It meant more than 15 hours in real time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Connecting to virtual reality for 15 hours a day wasn’t easy.&nbsp;</span><span style>The physiological needs were a basic problem, and he also consumed a lot of mental and physical power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Since the 11th island, I wasted a lot of time.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 11th to 19th islands were hunting or raid missions. It inevitably took a long time, causing Grid’s exhaustion to sharply rise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I’d rather finish this off today.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no time limit to the Behen Archipelago.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was no reason to endanger himself by being impatient.&nbsp;</span><span style>His level had risen to 306 and Grid was about to log out when he suddenly stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge shadow from the sky started to darken the surface of the island. It seemed like night time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid looked up and was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style>A huge circle was hiding the sun.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a circle made of tens of thousands of eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ugh."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid frowned with disgust. He had to swallow to push down his urge to vomit.&nbsp;</span><span style>The appearance of the circle was that bizarre.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were countless things like blood vessels on the surface that squirmed as the eyes blinked.&nbsp;</span><span style>The bloated eyeballs stimulated human fear and disgust to the limit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was this mission?&nbsp;</span><span style>The familiar notification window rose up as Grid ignored the eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A mission will be created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[20th Island]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Avoid the gaze of the hell moon!</span></p>
 <p><span style>First Clear Reward: 130 Challenger Points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The mission will start 30 minutes from now.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Hell moon?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hell moon looked like this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Perhaps.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had experience with visiting hell.&nbsp;</span><span style>The hell that he saw was nothing like the human world.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was hard to believe that such a terrible moon would appear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But who knows? I went to hell during the day.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was disgusting to see.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, it was imperative to observe the target in order to understand the purpose of the mission.&nbsp;</span><span style>It happened when Grid was looking up at the hell moon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A helper fairy has appeared.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A system that didn’t exist until after the 19th island was launched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hello Challenger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was it a height of 50cm?&nbsp;</span><span style>A little male fairy appeared in a burst of light and greeted him.&nbsp;</span><span style>His behavior and tone were extremely polite, but his expression was full of playfulness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fairy explained to the confused Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I am Bini, a fairy of love and justice, who has been asked by Sage Sticks to help the challengers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sticks asked you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, Sticks is anxiously waiting for a great challenger who can defeat the Behen Archipelago.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hoping for...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid thought that the trials that existed on each island were Sticks’ work.&nbsp;</span><span style>He thought it was to prove the qualifications of ‘those who wanted to go to the East Continent.’&nbsp;</span><span style>Now he realized he was mistaken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it isn’t Sticks, who made all the trials for each island?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don’t know. It was like this from the beginning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is on the last island?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don’t know that either. You can ask Sticks if you meet him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...I thought you were a helper fairy. You aren’t very helpful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Nope, I’m sure that I will help. My role is to help the challengers overcome the trials.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why didn’t you appear earlier?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I can’t help the rabble! I only help the challengers who have reached the 20th island by themselves! So please pay attention to me from now on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bini took out glasses and started to explain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In order to escape the 20th island, you have to avoid the hell moon’s gaze. There is a theory that the hell moon has 66,666 eyes. There is no place on this island where the hell moon’s eyes can’t reach.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then how do I escape it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Pretend that you aren’t a person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pretend that he wasn’t a person?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Wait.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was baffled by the ridiculous command when he recalled Blackening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What if I turn into a demon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wow, a challenger has the power of Blackening? Indeed, you’re someone who managed to get here! But unfortunately, that is wrong. It isn’t the right answer. The hell moon is hostile to all living creatures.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then from the beginning, it’s creatures.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Challenger is a human, so I tried to explain it from your eye level. Hehet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So how do I pretend to not be a creature?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The hell moon doesn’t recognize any stopped being as a creature. Just stop when the hell moon’s eyes are open. And exactly once every five seconds, you have to slowly move one step while all of the hell moon’s eyes are closed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is it like Red Light Green Light?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was reminded of a familiar game as he looked over the island.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style>The size of the island was considerable. It seemed to be two or three times the size of Yeouido.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Moving one step every five seconds... Where is my destination?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s voice trembled as he asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bini replied with a large grin,&nbsp;</span><span style>“To the other end of the island. The gate to the next island is there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If a person’s thinking power increased, would their personality change?&nbsp;</span><span style>That wasn’t the case.&nbsp;</span><span style>He might be developing, but this expansion of thinking power didn’t change his essential nature.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you crazy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid eventually revealed his true nature as he grabbed the diaper Bini was wearing.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bini was very embarrassed because half of his butt was exposed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What are you doing!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bini shivered as as Grid’s face came close to his.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your method of helping me is to tell me that moving one step every five seconds is the best way to make it past this island? Rather than giving me help, you are just making fun of me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t imagine how many days it would take to make it to the other end of the island using Bini’s method. In the first place, it was doubtful if he could maintain his concentration and patience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'It’s the worst if I have to stop when a monster is attacking.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bini hurriedly explained to the furious Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“12 hours! In 12 hours, the sun will come up! Once the sun rises, the hell moon will hide itself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I can only move one step every five seconds during the night, but I can act freely during the day?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right! Move during the day and fight with the hell moon at night! You only have to suffer for a few days! It will be difficult with sleep deprivation, but it’s possible!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The difficulty is too high.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the moment he admired Kraugel, who reached the 30th island.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Wait... Could I use that?'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid released the diaper as he had a wonderful thought.&nbsp;</span><span style>The second item that he created after Failure.&nbsp;</span><span style>Could he take advantage of it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Does the hell moon rely on senses other than sight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. I have never heard of that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks was probably watching right now...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tears of shame came to Bini’s eyes as he answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dark smile appeared on Grid’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style>He came up with a way to avoid the eyes of the hell moon.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now wasn’t the time.&nbsp;</span><span style>He needed time to rest, both physically and mentally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Log out.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah, so good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A restful night’s sleep felt good.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo stretched as he went out to the living room, where he saw Sehee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I got a call from Team Leader Do Minjun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Team Leader Do Minjun?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was a young elite of Saint Constructions.&nbsp;</span><span style>Saint Constructions.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was that best construction company that didn’t belong to any big corporations, and it was ranked 5th in South Korea.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was also the construction company responsible for the construction of Youngwoo’s 10 billion won building.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did Team Leader Do Minjun want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It was an interim report about how the construction is going well. She told Oppa to come visit the site. It is the first time that a client hasn’t visited their own building.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Where can I find the time to go there? I’m too busy playing the game."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shin Youngwoo, you are very trusting of people these days. In the old days, you would’ve thought they did a bad job since you can’t see them. You would’ve monitored the construction site 24 hours a day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t Saint Constructions doing the work in my name? In addition, it was a company recommended by Yura. Well, I don’t care. Sehee, do you want to go with our parents?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, understood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, Sehee thought of her brother as an object to be cared for.&nbsp;</span><span style>But that had changed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now she trusted and followed her brother. Her brother’s words and behavior were increasing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why did she trust her brother?&nbsp;</span><span style>Was it because her brother was earning a lot of money? Or because he was a celebrity?&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t for such petty reasons.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because Youngwoo’s nature itself had changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kraugel, isn’t he an unbelievably great guy when I searched on the Internet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He isn’t just at the level of being great.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you excited about winning over such a man?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are no grounds for it. I probably would’ve lost if he and I fought under the same conditions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was now equipped with humility?&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee gave a bittersweet smile as she saw her brother’s deep eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why is he changing every day?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her brother was growing everyday, but Sehee didn’t feel good. It felt like her brother was becoming more and more distant.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, she was also proud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’ll get dressed and have breakfast.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“When will he come?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those blessed or cursed by the gods to not die.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, Sticks was aware of the existence of users.&nbsp;</span><span style>He waited calmly after the black haired man suddenly disappeared from the 20th island.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dok.</span></i> <i><span style>Dok dok.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks tapped his staff while watching the magic ball.&nbsp;</span><span style>His eyes deep inside the robe contained tension and irritation.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment that the black haired man appeared again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Medicine. My medicine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He swallowed his medicine first to prepare for what would happen.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a homemade medicine.&nbsp;</span><span style>He took a deep breath to maintain his composure, before turning his eyes to the magic ball again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Can he even break through the 20th island?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Honestly, the possibility was low.&nbsp;</span><span style>So far, there had only been one person to pass the 20th island.&nbsp;</span><span style>It meant the difficulty of the 20th island was extremely high.&nbsp;</span><span style>Extreme patience was needed in order to avoid the gaze of the hell moon. At the same time, they needed wisdom to prevent the raids of monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Don’t be disappointed. Empty your mind.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But why?&nbsp;</span><span style>His expectations kept growing.&nbsp;</span><span style>The black haired man, so far he had exceeded Sticks’ wisdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Start!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gulp!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It happened when Sticks was looking at the red eyes of the hell moon and gulped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s gone!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a perfect invisibility that was incomparable to stealth techniques.&nbsp;</span><span style>The black haired man suddenly disappeared and avoided the gaze of the hell moon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This...! This isn’t invisibility magic!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected from a sage.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sticks quickly figured out why the man couldn’t be seen anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style>It made him even more surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Invisibility cloak...! A heritage of the altar of legends...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were only two historic treasures left, so why did that man have it?&nbsp;</span><span style>There were no clues to that man’s identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh... Kuock...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the moment that the sage’s wisdom became unclear.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Flop!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks once again experienced a big shock, grabbing his chest and collapsing.&nbsp;</span><span style>He took the medicine prescribed by a professional pharmacist.</span></p>
