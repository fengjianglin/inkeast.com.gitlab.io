 <p></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘Now!’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘It will be soon!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A young man was digging at the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was a beautiful young man.&nbsp;</span><span style>His beauty and grace didn’t fade, despite having sunburned skin and dirt stains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Not long now!’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk puk!</span></i> <i><span style>Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The young man with the shy expression.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was digging at the ground with a hand plow when he heard the cry he had been waiting for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s time for a snack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pupils of the young man greatly expanded.&nbsp;</span><span style>He jumped up and quickly used magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haste!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Haste.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a spell that raised the target’s speed from 1.2 to 2.5 times.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t easy to learn, but it was a useful magic that could be used extensively. Even if a person learned it, their performance would differ according to the capacity of the caster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A magician who could double their speed with Haste?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>There were no more than 100 of them on the continent.&nbsp;</span><span style>However!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Swaeeek!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The squatting young man showed off a phenomenal performance.&nbsp;</span><span style>His speed was doubled and no one could catch up with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That lousy person...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He’s trying to take all the potatoes today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The farmers were indignant.&nbsp;</span><span style>The young man who used Haste was Bland.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t hesitate to commit a foul by using magic to gain more potatoes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you forget that Piaro said we should divide it among ourselves?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will tell Piaro!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The farmers saw that he was about to leave and used a childish attack.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bland hesitated for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to eat!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bland who had a rich life as the son of Earl Ashur, one of the 10 great magicians on the continent!&nbsp;</span><span style>For him, potatoes were just food that pigs were forced to eat.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had never eaten potatoes, and only consumed the finest ingredients, which were more nutritious and tastier than potatoes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that changed after being held hostage in Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bland ate only potatoes to survive.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he became thrilled.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was surprised by the gorgeous taste and the instant feeling of fullness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In particular, the Rainbow Potato was a delicacy.&nbsp;</span><span style>He could get seven different types of tastes from one potato.&nbsp;</span><span style>A potato that he could only eat after being captured and suffering from a desperate situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>To Bland, it was more sacred than any blessing from a god. He was able to shake off all types of troubles and anxieties thanks to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was plenty of food in the developed Reidan, but the potatoes were still the best for Bland.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"You want one today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The housewives asked Bland, who had run across the vast fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Bland nodded without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The housewives thought it was pitiful.&nbsp;</span><span style>The beautiful young man in front of them.&nbsp;</span><span style>The housewives heard he was a precious child of a prestigious family. What wrong did he commit to live in slavery to Duke Grid?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every day Bland worked in the fields, then there were rumors that he was taken separately by Piaro to be beaten in all types of ways.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was clear that this young man must be experiencing a terrible life.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was painful enough to want to die every day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Eating to relieve his stress...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s a pity for such a good looking person.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A housewife tearfully handed the snack to Bland.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were 10 baked potatoes and 10 boiled potatoes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"As you know, there is only supposed to be one potato per person...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I know that you are always suffering, so I will give you all of this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please eat and gain strength!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The people pity me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bland had a unique bloodline and had been on the best elite course in the kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t have many opportunities to associate with the common people.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, his time in Reidan started to change his perception little by little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The people have a hard life, but they still take care of others. It’s too much.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was ridiculous.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he couldn’t help admiring it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bland received the handkerchief containing potatoes and frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There’s no need to worry about me. My bloodline means my physical strength isn’t weak, so I won’t get sick. There’s no need for unnecessary worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bland’s speech was prideful and could hurt the housewives’s feelings.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the housewives were fine.&nbsp;</span><span style>They thought it was cute that the young man didn’t know how to express himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Potato... I originally thought it was pig food, but I will eat it anyway.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bah! Bland snorted and held the handkerchief close to his chest. Contrary to what he said, he clearly cherished the potatoes.&nbsp;</span><span style>He left the place.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this time, the farmers belatedly arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He took so much!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Some of us might not have enough to eat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Damn that man!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Noisy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were so excited that they had to run around and yell?&nbsp;</span><span style>It truly was shameful.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bland clicked his tongue and moved to a secluded place.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was near the north wall.&nbsp;</span><span style>He sat down to eat the potatoes when his eyes sank.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There are a bunch of rats’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a suspicious group clinging to one side of Reidan’s high walls.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were 20 of them.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were moving carefully and slowly climbing the wall.&nbsp;</span><span style>The color of their clothes was similar to the color of the wall, making their stealth great.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Bland from before he came to Reidan wouldn’t have been able to detect them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hrmm."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Half a day ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asmophel led the army away, so it seemed like something big was occurring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It doesn’t have anything to do with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bland didn’t care if the 20 assassins climbing the wall were successful in infiltrating Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wouldn’t care even if they slaughtered people and set Reidan on fire.&nbsp;</span><span style>In fact, looking at it from his position, he should be applauding them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why didn’t he like it?&nbsp;</span><span style>Bland placed a boiled potato in his mouth and stood up.&nbsp;</span><span style>The delicious potatoes, the farmers who suffered with him, and the housewives who cooked the potatoes and cared about him.&nbsp;</span><span style>They might be harmed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>More than anything else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Irene.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman he once loved was in Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had no lingering feelings for her. She had already become the woman of another man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I want her to be happy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bland’s mind was made up by the time he put the third potato in his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fire Arrow.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hwaruruk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The 20 assassins climbing the wall.&nbsp;</span><span style>Eight fire arrows were shot at them.&nbsp;</span><span style>The momentum was completely different from a usual Fire Arrow.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was natural.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had been trained by Piaro for 16 months while doing field work every day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He farmed... No, he could now borrow the natural mana of the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was similar to the Natural State that belonged to the legendary Piaro.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Daluka.&nbsp;</span><span style>An assassin wrapped in the veil of mystery.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were many speculations that Doran and Kasim were disciples of Daluka.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then one day 10 years ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Eternal Kingdom were lucky enough to obtain one of Daluka’s hidden techniques.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From then on, they started raising the Silver Dragons group.&nbsp;</span><span style>They took 5,000 orphans from all over the kingdom and trained them as assassins, giving them Daluka’s hidden technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, it wasn’t easy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of the 5,000 children who endured the training and survived, only 40 were trained in Daluka’s technique.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of these 40 people, not one of them had mastered the technique. They could only scratch the surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But this alone was enough.&nbsp;</span><span style>One year since the launch of the Silver Dragons group.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Silver Dragons had a 100% success rate with their missions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Prince Ren was confident.&nbsp;</span><span style>With the power of the Silver Dragons, the Eternal Kingdom would grow until they could eventually threaten the Saharan Empire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that time, the silver dragon drawn on the flag would spread open both wings again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is happening?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 20 members of the Silver Dragons were baffled.&nbsp;</span><span style>Agricultural fields spread out in all directions from Reidan’s outer walls.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had to pass through this place to get to Reidan, but the conditions of the farmers were strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why are they farmers?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were dozens of farmers scattered through the vast fields.&nbsp;</span><span style>But their movements were unusual.&nbsp;</span><span style>The way they wielded the sickle and hand plow was reminiscent of swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, a few farmers were strong enough to make the Silver Dragon members sensitive towards them. They seemed like influential people who would represent a kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Silver Dragons had learned Daluka’s Absence of Worldly Desires technique.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a breathing method that allowed them to infiltrate many places, even if it was only at the 5th stage.&nbsp;</span><span style>And the 20 people assigned to this mission were elite 5th stage Absence of Worldly Desires members. It meant they wouldn’t show any agitation, even when facing death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the farmers couldn’t help making their hearts unsettled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is better to move more carefully.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Silver Dragon members made the correct judgment and lay flat on the ground, crawling through the fields. They didn’t want to be seen by the farmers.&nbsp;</span><span style>The result.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Pant pant... It’s dirty.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A lot of time and stamina was consumed by the time the Silver Dragons reached Reidan’s outer walls, making them &nbsp;fall behind schedule.&nbsp;</span><span style>Originally, they should’ve already had the duchess. Yet they hadn’t even crossed the outer walls yet?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It was truly shocking for the Silver Dragon members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But they were elites.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Erase the shaking.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The members regained their calm thanks to Absence of Worldly Desires. Then they used ‘Daluka’s Clothes.’&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a technique that could achieve the ultimate stealth by making them like a chameleon.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Susuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sususuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Even the gods in the sky wouldn’t be able to see them right now!&nbsp;</span><span style>Then fire arrows flew towards the backs of the Silver Dragons climbing without any doubts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Heok!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>How were they noticed?&nbsp;</span><span style>The Silver Dragons avoided the magic and hurriedly looked around.&nbsp;</span><span style>The magic flew from the direction of one person.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a farmer eating potatoes.&nbsp;</span><span style>The sun-tanned skin really made him seem like a hillbilly. It was unexpected, but this person was certainly a farmer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Did he use the magic?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was fast and powerful magic that they couldn’t completely avoid!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The farmers in this area are crazy!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eyes of the Silver Dragons shook.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their 5th stage Absence of Worldly Desires started shaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘We can’t delay any longer. Should we ignore him and continue the mission?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No. Witnesses must be taken care of immediately in order to complete the secret mission.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Silver Dragons made a quick decision.&nbsp;</span><span style>They dropped down from the wall towards the farmer chewing potatoes.&nbsp;</span><span style>A magician had very weak defense.&nbsp;</span><span style>They believed that they could easily overpower the magician.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The magician’s bombardment?&nbsp;</span><span style>There was no need to worry about that.&nbsp;</span><span style>Don’t give him time to cast!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The confident faces of the Silver Dragons distorted.&nbsp;</span><span style>The guy was a farmer or magician.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now he was creating a shield and pulling out a sword?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is his identity?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Farmer, magician, swordsman.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was uncertain.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bland shot Fire Blast at the Silver Dragons.&nbsp;</span><span style>Using another spell while creating a shield as well?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Double casting!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Silver Dragons paled.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their 5th stage Absence of Worldly Desires was broken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Throw it again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King of Shadows, Kasim.&nbsp;</span><span style>The strongest assassin who had taken numerous lives was busy spending time with a newborn baby.&nbsp;</span><span style>He kept forcing the baby to do something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Abu! Abuuuu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The baby clamored with sharp eyes that resembled his father’s.&nbsp;</span><span style>It felt like he was saying that he would do it this time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lord flew a block at a doll 3m away and it fell.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an achievement that had taken two days.&nbsp;</span><span style>The growth was much faster than what Kasim predicted.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kasim was convinced as he felt something beyond admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This child...! This child will be able to master all of Master’s skills!’</span></p>
