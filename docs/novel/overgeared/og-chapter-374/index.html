 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[Vampire Baron Mountain has been destroyed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[211,555,002 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Three Blessed Armor Enhancement Stones have been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Nine armor enhancement stones have been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Skillbook: Skin Enhancement has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A vampire baron.&nbsp;</span><span style>A semi-boss grade monster that could be raided in 10~15 minutes when five of the Overgeared elites were gathered together.&nbsp;</span><span style>But once the power of Grid and Yura were added, the raid speed was shortened by at least three times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Catching a semi-boss monster in 5 minutes...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The power of Grid and Yura was so good that it made Pon, Vantner, and Faker lose their words.&nbsp;</span><span style>They knew from the beginning that Grid had the trinity of stats, items, and class, but Yura’s growth was astonishing and dazzling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s the power of my class and items.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura explained briefly and clearly.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was also becoming overgeared.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>A corridor to the north on the castle’s first floor.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka and Zednos were isolated in the middle with enemies on both sides.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the aftermath of the teleportation trap that Regas stepped on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Multi Shot."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wind Wave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka blocked the vampires in the right corridor, while Zednos blocked the ones in the left corridor.&nbsp;</span><span style>Arrows and magic poured out and slowed down the vampires’ momentum.&nbsp;</span><span style>But of course, there was a limit.</span><span style>The number of vampires was endless, so Jishuka and Zednos’ mana gradually depleted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&nbsp;“The respawn speed is ridiculous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We’re really isolated in the worst place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their stamina fell to a dangerous level.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka and Zednos were covered with sweat and breathing roughly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The vampires took advantage of it with their magic.&nbsp;</span><span style>One of the blood shots flew through the gap and hit Jishuka’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jishuka!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka’s form collapsed as she was loading a new arrow, Zednos was shocked and dozens of vampires approached the two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wind Cutter! Wind Missile!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zednos started to go on a rampage.&nbsp;</span><span style>He only thought about protecting Jishuka, so he cast magic without considering his mana.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to that, they could pass the immediate criss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have no mana.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your mana potion cooldown time hasn’t returned.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zednos’ face turned white.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Jishuka’s voice was heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Bow down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zednos didn’t delay.&nbsp;</span><span style>He thoroughly trusted Jishuka and immediately followed her words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Phoenix Arrow.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A giant fire bird flew over Zednos’ head and turned one of the corridors into fire.&nbsp;</span><span style>Over 50 vampires were swept away and Jishuka urged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Use this gap to escape.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zednos didn’t easily move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What? I’m buying time while you run away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka stood up to secure Zednos’ retreat.&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite her noticeable slowed speed after Phoenix Arrow, she stood up to the vampires approaching from the other corridor.&nbsp;</span><span style>The arrows fired from her hand precisely penetrated the vampires.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mithril arrows and silver arrows dealt additional damage to the vampires, but Jishuka was already exhausted.&nbsp;</span><span style>The vampires were shot in the head, but continued to move forward to hit Jishuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“J-Jishuka.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why aren’t you leaving? Shouldn’t you go and join our colleagues?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka had opened a path, but it was unknown when new vampires would appear.&nbsp;</span><span style>Zednos didn’t want Jishuka’s sacrifice to be in vain and was about to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Jishuka, avoid it.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sururuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Between Jishuka and Zednos.&nbsp;</span><span style>Someone suddenly appeared in a place where nothing had been present.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Grid who was wearing a white hooded zip up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Transcended Link.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As the blue-black energy blades shot out, dozens of vampires in the corridor facing Jishuka disappeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>New vampires appeared straight afterwards, but the respawn rate couldn’t hold up against the overwhelming attack power of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka, who was saved by Grid at the moment of crisis, felt thrilled and hugged Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her sweaty skin and something big gave a huge stimulus to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Ga... Ganadaramabasa...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a soft and supple feeling.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s nose was affected by the excitement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura, who belatedly arrived, witnessed his appearance and looked down at her chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m not small either.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was significantly larger than the average size of Korean women, but Grid’s taste was too unrealistic.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Regas had an overwhelming combat sense, Peak Sword had a sword that was hard to read and cope with, Toon could transform into all types of beasts and demonstrated effective combat power, Ibellin’s talents weren’t fully developed yet, but he was recognized as a genius by Piaro, Toban was the 1st ranked paladin that acted as a poison to vampires, and Huroi was the 1st ranked orator.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This combination showed the strongest combat power.&nbsp;</span><span style>Regas and Toon acted behind Huroi and Toban, who attracted the enemy’s gaze. Peak Sword and Ibellin struck through any gaps, so the three vampire barons didn’t last long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A strength elixir has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been two months since Overgeared started exploring the vampire cities.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had hunted tens of thousands of vampires so far, but not one elixir had dropped.&nbsp;</span><span style>The party were thrilled by the unexpected benefit and then realized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There's no time to be idle. Let’s go save our colleagues.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The vampire expedition was strong. But without Toban and Huroi, the stability of the party would fall.&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword knew this point and urged the party. At this moment...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How have you been?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their boss came.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Damn Regas, I had to suffer because of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Please never go in front again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon and Vantner scolded Regas.&nbsp;</span><span style>Regas’ behavior put his colleagues at risk, so he was deserving of criticism.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will be careful about becoming too excited.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas regretted his mistake and showed repentance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pon and Vantner closed their mouths with satisfaction, and Jishuka asked Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How did you get here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A vampire city’s entrance was blocked after someone entered.&nbsp;</span><span style>It meant it was impossible to enter the city while the dungeon raid was going on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid explained,&nbsp;</span><span style>“This is his power.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everybody looked at Sticks.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elves, the noble race that was called the incarnation of beauty and who fought for the pace of the world.&nbsp;</span><span style>Among them, the well known high elf Sticks introduced himself to everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello, I am Sticks. I owe Grid my life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Another named NPC...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s network expanded every day, causing the Overgeared members to feel surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an unique ability to become friendly with named NPCs.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid suggested to the excited and happy guild members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let’s leave here. If we borrow Sticks’ power, we can escape from this place."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members were alarmed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grid, is it okay to leave when we can capture this place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The 1st floor has been cleared, so why do we have to run away?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some of the party members weren’t convinced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'm in favor at Grid’s suggestion. There are many baron grade vampires on the 1st floor. In the worst case scenario, the 2nd floor might be filled with viscounts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The 1st floor’s boss was a viscount called Tiramet. It is likely that marquis grade vampires will emerge on the 2nd and 3rd floor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"In the worst case, Marie Rose might appear and I don’t think we can go against her with our strength.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were some members who agreed with Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was those who had fallen into danger and needed to be rescued by Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>In this bad atmosphere, Grid gave them a meaningful smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s do special training.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Special training?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There is a place called the Behen Archipelago. The entry is limited to one person, but since it’s an instant dungeon, you can enter separately and proceed at the same time."</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was the Behen Archipelago and what could they get from there?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid started to explain what he had experienced.&nbsp;</span><span style>The faces of the Overgeared members turned rosy as they listened to the story.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The Sword Grave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hundreds of thousands of weapons were embedded in the hill, and it was known as the place where the legendary blacksmith Pagma spent his last years.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Agnus’ reason for finding it was unrelated to Pagma.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The legendary magician Braham.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was to secure his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don't know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He heard that there was an ice wall somewhere in the Sword Grave, and Braham’s body was sealed there.&nbsp;</span><span style>But despite searching for nearly a month, Agnus couldn’t find any ice walls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“At that time, I should’ve secured the soul.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One month ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>Agnus had encountered Braham’s soul here, but missed it.&nbsp;</span><span style>He still trembled when he thought about that time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I didn’t think his soul could use magic.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Takak.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Takak takak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As Agnus leaned back against a greatsword, hundreds of his summoned skeletons were thoroughly searching the hill.&nbsp;</span><span style>They touched the swords embedded in the hill, searched the ground and tried to find Braham’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, finding the body was impossible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...I can’t stay here forever.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, there were a lot of monsters in the vicinity so his level up speed didn’t lag behind. But due to staying in one place for one month, his various quests didn’t progress.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, Agnus confirmed the Rune of Death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Rune of Death]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bound Item</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is permanently preserved in your inventory. Trading, dropping or destroying it is impossible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Usage Effect: Increases the abilities of your summons in exchange for some leadership stats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a 20% increase in the stats of all summons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unique Lasting Effect: When you take the body of a named person or monster and make it your own, you can absorb their unique characteristics.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Blue Knight’s Faith: Creates a shield that absorbs 10,000 damage. Cooldown Time: 1 hour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Bentao’s Talisman: Exchange your health with the target’s health. Cooldown Time: 12 hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Tarant’s Swordsmanship: The Advanced Sword Mastery skill is created. You can use ‘Bloodless’ when wearing a sword type weapon. It is a unique and lasting effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Mumud’s Knowledge: Magic casting speed will increase by 15%. Mana regeneration rate will increase by 30%. It is a unique and lasting effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it went as originally planned, Braham’s trait should also belong to the Rune of Death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I wanted a legendary lich.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agnus sent a whisper to Veradin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Where is the nest of the great demon, Furfu?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Time was equal to everyone.&nbsp;</span><span style>As Grid and the Overgeared Guild were growing, the other players were equally growing.</span></p>
