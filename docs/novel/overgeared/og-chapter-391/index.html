 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The flail was a swinging tool. It was impossible to stab or cut with it.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was why Grid chose the black iron wood as the material.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Resilience is important for this type of weapon.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black iron wood was ‘bent iron.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had high rigidity and elasticity. Generally, it was used as a material for spears and the price was very expensive. The rankers and knights of each kingdom needed to have spears made of black iron wood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In short, it’s one of the best materials.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was impossible to buy it without any pressure.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid judged that it was natural to have the finest materials for the items he created.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an item created by a legendary blacksmith, how could he use lacking materials?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It hurts that the expenses are so big.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid swallowed back his tears and devoted himself to working on the black iron wood.&nbsp;</span><span style>First of all, he made a 1.3 meter pole and attached four long sticks to the end.&nbsp;</span><span style>The pole was at a width that was comfortable to hold in his hands, while the slender twigs were trimmed as sharply and thinly as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have a good feeling.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shaving, combining, etc.&nbsp;</span><span style>After repeating a series of processes, Grid looked at the thin sticks that had been shaped and expected the birth of a legendary item.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid’s feeling of ‘not bad’ didn’t fit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have completed the production of the Motley Flail.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Motley Flail.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 259/259 &nbsp;Attack Power: 143~191</span></p>
 <p><span style>* A special effect will occur every time the target is hit. The effect is unpredictable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Thrashing speed will increase by 150%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is no guarantee how the condition of the thrashed grain will change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Farming equipment designed by Grid who has been reborn as a legend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It’s made of solid black iron wood and has excellent durability and attack power. It’s at a level to be called a weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the effects can’t be guaranteed due to the influence of Silverun’s Secret Remedy. Use with caution. It is recommended that you don’t use it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>User Restriction: Level 200 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 109</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Shit, just a little bit more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be nice if his hope worked out just once.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sticks didn’t notice Grid’s frustration and spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s a great flail. It seems to be a good farming equipment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was his sarcastic way of asking why Grid was making farming equipment.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, Grid declared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This isn’t conventional farming equipment, but a weapon. I’m going to use this to break through the 41st island.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A weapon...!!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks admired it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s spirit was amazing to think about using a flail as a trump weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sticks was a sage. He was a wise man. He tried to understand Grid rather than treat him as a strange person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'There must be something deeply profound.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that didn’t mean he had confidence.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sticks looked over.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was grabbing the hammer again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will give the unique-rated one as a gift to Piaro.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would challenge it one more time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I have to get a legendary rated flail!’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid pledged and started working on the spare black iron wood. Finally, he got the desired form and added Silverun’s Secret Remedy.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a result, once again, a unique-rated flail was completed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...This $%!#.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been a really long time since Grid cursed like this.&nbsp;</span><span style>His thinking power might’ve expanded and his personality matured, but his essence couldn’t change.&nbsp;</span><span style>A year and a half had passed since he became Pagma's Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, only 12 legendary items were made.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even a saint would be enraged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why can’t a legendary blacksmith make legendary items?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Probability games were really rotten.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid realized it once again and soothed his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Okay, let’s calm down. It isn’t necessary to have a legendary flail to break through the 41st island.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t want a flail for its attack power. He only needed a random effect to cause a reversal.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted a legendary rated flail for the special event and rise in stats, but it was better not to be obsessed with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now I will practice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>21 hours passed since the creation and production of the flail.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid needed to get used to the flail in the next three hours, until the cooldown of his immortality and Noe and Randy returned.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The 41st island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bring it on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clone was puzzled when it saw Grid holding a flail.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a person with 100% of Grid’s abilities, it found it strange that Grid would use the flail.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Motley Flail.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clone checked the options of the flail and couldn’t understand Grid more and more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s an inefficient weapon.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why did he appear with this?&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone questioned it, but didn’t think deeply.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reason for the clone’s existence was just to hurt Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was useless to question the behavior of someone who would die soon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The clone moved forward.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was dazzling like a butterfly’s wings.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the precursor of Link.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pit!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pipipipipit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The clone quickly unfolded the attack.&nbsp;</span><span style>The sharp energy blades shot out from Grid’s Greatsword and aimed at Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Grid from 24 hours ago would’ve avoided this attack and fought back.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now Grid had regained his original judgment.&nbsp;</span><span style>The swords flying towards him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I won’t stop it!’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Blood spread like a fog around Grid’s body was he was hit by Link.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why didn’t Grid take any defensive actions?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was for a quick counterattack.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t resist the enemy’s attack and swung the flail.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hwiririk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clone’s eyes shook.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s right, it was hit.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s speed was incomparably faster, causing the clone to feel confused.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The clone was struck in the face with the flail.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was the sound of a watermelon bursting and blood scattered, but it was just the appearance.&nbsp;</span><span style>The four thin sticks on the flail were so sharp that they triggered bleeding, but the damage was actually low.&nbsp;</span><span style>But was damage important?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ssik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s mouth curved upwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s try it once!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Motley Flail caused a random effect when it hit the target.&nbsp;</span><span style>It could give a buff or a debuff.&nbsp;</span><span style>It would be the worst if the target was giving a buff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'A debuff is no use.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid knew.&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone was the same as him.&nbsp;</span><span style>A debuff wouldn’t have a big effect.&nbsp;</span><span style>Nevertheless, the reason why Grid fought with the flail was because he believed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It will have a definite effect, not simple debuffs...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>For example, the effect of decreasing the target’s health to 1 point or increasing the weight gauge to MAX.&nbsp;</span><span style>These effects weren’t classified as debuffs, so Grid couldn’t withstand the physical effects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The effect of the Motley Flail is triggered!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The flail had an immediate effect after hitting the clone.&nbsp;</span><span style>A light flashed once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The target’s attack power will double for 10 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had already decided.&nbsp;</span><span style>An unlucky bastard like him, depending on an item with random effects, the probability of getting a positive outcome was like winning the lottery.&nbsp;</span><span style>But still, this was too much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If it is double the attack power...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid stepped back as the clone’s greatsword started moving.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a basic attack, but the level was that of a skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s eyes shook as he received great damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, he didn’t forget to fight back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The effect of the Motley Flail is triggered!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The target’s maximum health will triple for 10 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The effect of the Motley Flail is triggered!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The target’s skill damage will increase by 20% for 10 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The effect of the Motley Flail is triggered!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Grants a shield spell to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The effect of the Motley Flail is triggered!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The target has been affected by the silence state.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The target has resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah, really!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s anger soared as the battle continued.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pisik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The clone ridiculed him.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the first emotion that the clone showed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You bastard...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid gritted his teeth.&nbsp;</span><span style>At first glance, it seemed like he had lost his reason.&nbsp;</span><span style>But reality was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had already anticipated this and was prepared to die a few more times.&nbsp;</span><span style>He constantly struck the clone and activated the effect of the flail.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the clone was careless.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because the effect of the flail continuously favored him.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was careless as Grid continued to swing the flail. He didn’t avoid Grid’s attack as he kept pressing Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered fatal damage!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A legend doesn’t die easily. You can resist all attacks for 5 seconds with a minimum of health.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Grid went on the defensive.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to generate more effects, he tried to speed up his attacks using Blackening, Blacksmith’s Rage and Quick Movements, but it just ended up helping the clone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have no choice but to be lucky in the next challenge.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid gave up on this game. He cleared his mind and wielded the flail.&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone didn’t even bother avoiding the flail.&nbsp;</span><span style>The odds of the flail threatening him was like finding a needle in the desert.&nbsp;</span><span style>Indeed, it showed that the clone had a very high artificial intelligence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The concept of ‘chance’ was insignificant to him.&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone was making fun of him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately before Grid’s immortality passive was over.&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone was surprised when it was struck in the face just as the match was about to finish.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was even more surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The effect of the Motley Flail is triggered!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Change health values with the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The confused clone hurriedly tried to pull out a potion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Where are you going?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smiled with satisfaction and kicked the clone’s abdomen.&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone’s health fell to 1 and it entered the immortality state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t miss this opportunity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid declared and summoned Noe and Randy.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment of the end of the long battle was approaching.</span></p>
