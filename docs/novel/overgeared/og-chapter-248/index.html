 <p><span style>Chapter 248</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>If the Overgeared members were asked who they trusted the most, they would answer without hesitation: Faker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gazed into the shadows that his companions couldn’t see and, with the tip of his weapon, destroyed any who was brave enough to try and harm his companions.&nbsp;</span><span style>His reason for being silent was caution, and his remarks became reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You will die here today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Five minutes after the battle commenced, Faker finally revealed himself.&nbsp;</span><span style>A terrible anger appeared on Bondre’s face as he exclaimed,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Faker, this guy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only five minutes, the amount of time it took to go to the bathroom. That was it.&nbsp;</span><span style>During that period of time, 11 of Bondre’s colleagues were killed.&nbsp;</span><span style>The dagger had a dispel function that made the shields of the magicians useless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing here? How did you predict that we would be going through this place? No, how did you know that we were going to invade Reidan in the first place? Did you plant a spy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Spy?&nbsp;</span><span style>There wasn’t enough manpower in Reidan for that.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was just a coincidence.&nbsp;</span><span style>Faker had to avoid the gaze of the empire while he was transporting the refugees.&nbsp;</span><span style>He chose this narrow thorny vine forest as his route and encountered the Ice Flower Guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This</span><span style> could be called luck.&nbsp;</span><span style>Did he need to explain all of this to Bondre?&nbsp;</span><span style>No.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bondre’s face turned red as Faker remained silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn bastard! Are you ignoring me now?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chwachachachak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Six ice pillars emerged from the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had used S-grade magic a little while ago to completely devastate the forest and make Faker reveal himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the moment when magic of the same level was manifested.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bondre stood in the cold air and smiled as he said,&nbsp;</span><span style>“This is one of the spells I prepared to kill Grid. Can you hold on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ice Dragon’s Fury: an S-grade spell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Six huge ice pillars swirled in the air like a flight of Dragons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll kill you before trampling on Reidan!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The six ice pillars attacked Faker from all directions.&nbsp;</span><span style>Power, speed, and range.&nbsp;</span><span style>Nothing was lacking. The only downside of this magic was that it consumed a large amount of mana. However, it wouldn’t completely deplete the mana of a top grade magician.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘As long as his cover is gone, he will die! Come on! The person who took the 11th rank that was originally my position!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bondre was sure of his victory.&nbsp;</span><span style>He knew he could neutralize an assassin’s swiftness with a wide area magic spell.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Don’t give an assassin time to avoid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The relatively weak attack power compared to a single damage skill?&nbsp;</span><span style>It didn’t matter.&nbsp;</span><span style>Assassins had low health, just like magicians.&nbsp;</span><span style>Once hit by the spell, the only result was...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The confident Bondre’s eyes shook, refusing to believe the spectacle unfolding before them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Left.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Right.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwajajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Left again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This time it was up.&nbsp;</span><span style>While six ice pillars rotated like the saw blades in a blender, Faker moved so fast that only afterimages were left behind.&nbsp;</span><span style>What about the cold air that caused the speed to drop?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How high is Faker’s agility?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, it wasn’t just a matter of agility.&nbsp;</span><span style>High speed that couldn’t be controlled was akin to having a pearl necklace around a pig’s neck.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Faker was in complete control of the speed that transcended common sense. No, it wasn’t just at the level of control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Godly co...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Godly control.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a modifier that only existed for Kraugel so far!&nbsp;</span><span style>As Bondre was in shock, Faker expressed his gratitude to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I always admire the items you make.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wind God’s Leather Armor.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the armor that Grid made based on the production method that Faker had obtained.&nbsp;</span><span style>Originally, this armor increased the wearer’s agility by 6% and all speeds by 12%.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid’s recreation of the armor increased agility by 8% and all speeds by 15%.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Susuk.</span></i> <i><span style>Sususuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The afterimages increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the third assassin classes, ‘Master of Swiftness,’ the class that required the highest level of control among all the classes in Satisfy. After meeting Grid’s items and Faker’s control, its capabilities were increased by 200% .</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unbelievable!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The six pillars gradually lost momentum, while Faker’s speed increased.&nbsp;</span><span style>Anyone looking at him was likely to feel dizzy.&nbsp;</span><span style>The guild members tried casting magic in order to limit Faker’s movements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Daggers flew and stopped their casting.&nbsp;</span><span style>There wasn’t a pattern, but he avoided the big magic that dominated the whole area while stopping other magic casting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is a scam!’&nbsp;</span><span style>It was strange. Faker’s skills were more than rumored.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘Weren’t the original rumors exaggerated? So why is it the opposite?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The duration of Ice Dragon’s Fury finally ended.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bondre hurriedly exclaimed,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Use the spells in your orb!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They could use the spells stored in their orbs without any casting. But the magicians were reluctant to use it. It was a last resort.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now it was time to use their last resort.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwajik!</span></i> <i><span style>Kwajijijik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Magics with all types of attributes immediately appeared and aimed for Faker.&nbsp;</span><span style>As he flew around the ice pillars, the spells struck his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s it! We did it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, it was a misunderstanding.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their spells had hit an afterimage, not Faker’s body. Faker’s condition was relatively fine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This damn thing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bondre cursed as Faker only suffered minor damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>He invoked ‘Double Casting’ and used two spells at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuuong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After minimizing Faker’s activities radius using an ice barrier,</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeok!</span></i> <i><span style>Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Then he unfolded the Ice Spider Web.&nbsp;</span><span style>The other guild members cast spells at the same time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What will Faker do now?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Master of Swiftness class had clear limits.&nbsp;</span><span style>It couldn’t move through the shadows like a Master of Shadows, nor did it have defense abilities.&nbsp;</span><span style>The only advantage was speed, so it was possible to disable the class if speed was suppressed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Faker threw smoke bombs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to the thick smoke, Bondre and the magicians were unable to see Faker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bondre laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuhahahaha! This guy! You can’t do anything with the Ice Spider Web pressuring you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The magicians used magic of the wind attribute. A gust of wind blew away the smokescreen, revealing Faker who would be stuck in the Ice Spider Web...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Where did he go?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bondre and the magicians were stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style>How did he conceal himself on flat ground without any cover?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Hide!’&nbsp;</span><span style>It was clear that he dug a tunnel to hide in.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘Such a pathetic method!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bondre used detection magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sweat trickled down Bondre’s cheek.&nbsp;</span><span style>The detection magic was telling him that Faker was behind his back.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A sharp dagger aimed towards Bondre’s neck.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the same time, Faker released the white hoodie he was wearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Invisibility cloak...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Ice Flower Guild were reminded.&nbsp;</span><span style>Faker was an Overgeared member.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, this meant that Faker was equipped with the power of items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bondre cursed as the dagger was stuck in his neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the blazing sun.&nbsp;</span><span style>Red flowers bloomed on the gleaming spider webs.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was once the world’s best gaming BJ.&nbsp;</span><span style>The average number of people who watched the broadcast in real time was close to 150,000.&nbsp;</span><span style>But that was a story of the past.&nbsp;</span><span style>Currently, the average number of viewers had dropped to 30,000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to overcome this crisis, it was necessary to renew his viewers and gain some publicity.&nbsp;</span><span style>He needed new broadcast material that attracted people’s attention. More provocative material.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny used his network and was able to obtain the best information that the seven guilds would unite and attempt to invade Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay. Good video quality, good angle."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fortified city, Patrian.&nbsp;</span><span style>Beyond it was the west of the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny activated the video recording feature and filmed the Yak Guild and Zeraph Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>The two guilds had approximately 200 members.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bunny Bunny checked that there was nobody around and whispered as he relayed the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you see them? Their IDs can’t be confirmed because they are wearing masks, but considering their features, they are surely the Yak Guild and Zeraph Guild. The information I obtained was true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny was cautious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, the two guilds have started moving. I will follow from a distance so that I won’t get caught.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wouldn’t be good if he was discovered.&nbsp;</span><span style>The seven guilds didn’t want it known that they united and were going to invade Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was shameful.&nbsp;</span><span style>The seven guilds that represented Satisfy had joined forces to invade just one city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The master of the Yak Guild, Bubat is covering his face, but it is easy to guess his identity. It is because his size is as big as a bull. Huh? What is this situation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny was following the two guilds at a reasonable distance when he suddenly stopped.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dozens of knights were blocking the march of the two guilds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, what is this? Why are the knights stopping the Yak Guild and Zeraph Guild? Isn’t it curious? Right? Should I go closer? Okay. I will risk my life and narrow the distance in order to get rid of your curiosity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny was a level 209 assassin. He used Stealth and hid behind cover, so both guilds couldn’t detect him.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the first place, they were busy concentrating on the knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What are you guys? Why are you blocking our way?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this? Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guild members questioned the knights, but they stayed silent. They stood like an iron wall to block the guild members.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, Bubat couldn’t bear it and went forward directly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you preventing us from using the gate? If you don’t give a reasonable explanation, I will break through by force.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You have no right to ask questions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A middle-aged man with white robes emerged.&nbsp;</span><span style>The name above his head was Ashur.&nbsp;</span><span style>The master of the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Earl Ashur...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Ashur was one of the 10 great magicians on the continent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why was such a big person blocking their way?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Ashur asked the curious guild members.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Why do you want to go to the west?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There is no reason to answer the question.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Reason?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Ashur snorted. Then he released his overwhelming magic power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eek...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The faces of the guild members turned white.&nbsp;</span><span style>The strong magic power felt like steel crushing their bodies.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Ashur’s golden eyes sunk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It is natural for you to answer my questions. There is no need to discuss why. Understood?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh...! What the hell was this? Why is this happening?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was absurd.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bubat couldn’t understand the current situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Ashur raised his voice and asked again, No, he ordered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me why you are going to the west.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The magic balls installed throughout Patrian were Earl Ashur’s eyes and ears.&nbsp;</span><span style>Through the magic balls, Earl Ashur already knew that they were going to invade Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Nevertheless, it was a type of game to listen to their answers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bubat lied.&nbsp;</span><span style>"We are just going hunting...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hunting? Kukuk, that is an obvious lie. Another lying bastard from the past just came to mind."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Ashur’s precious son was being held hostage in Reidan. He had no intention of letting these guys go, when they might harm his son.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll give you a choice. Return the way you came, or have your bones buried in my city.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaeeeeeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dozens of knights drew their swords, while the soldiers on the wall pulled back their bowstrings.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Ashur’s expression was arrogant as he stood behind them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bunny Bunny was thrilled as he recorded the situation while hiding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Doesn’t it seem like Earl Ashur is Duke Grid’s ally?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the continent’s 10 great magicians was loyal to a user!&nbsp;</span><span style>This was a scoop above all other scoops.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was convinced that if he broadcasted the current scene, he could get a lot of viewers.</span></p>
