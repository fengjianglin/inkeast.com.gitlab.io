 <p><span style>Chapter 211</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Coke was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He lost more than a third of his health when hit by a bone thrown by a beggar?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A bug?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a reasonable guess.&nbsp;</span><span style>A bug made more sense than a high level user like him being so damaged by a bone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who was he?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Less than half a year after starting Satisfy, he reached level 109 and was one of the best known players in Patrian. He also had a chance to hunt one of the most notorious monsters near Patrian, the orc captain, alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will be a god in the future, so I can’t be hurt by a bone...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Coke’s goal was Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was his desire to be called God Coke on the world stage, just like Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had such a lofty goal that today’s experience was even more humiliating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You hit me so, I’ll hit you back!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Coke rolled up his sleeves. Then he swung his hand at Piaro’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 3,140 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, it was a bean.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t even a big kidney bean, but a small pea.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was shocked as a pea flew out and hit him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Unbelievable! It wasn’t a bug?’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jeurereuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Blood poured from Coke’s mouth as he finally figured out the situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was able to realize that Piaro wasn’t a beggar, but a tremendously high level NPC.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I didn’t understand the subject!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy was famous for never having a bug since it opened. It was rumored that the creator, Lim Cheolho, was a god.&nbsp;</span><span style>Coke belatedly tried to change his attitude.&nbsp;</span><span style>He attempted to avoid a situation by apologizing to Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it was still a crisis because the other users didn’t understand the atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That guy is throwing food! Coke! Smash him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Teach that beginner and NPC a lesson!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The users didn’t know that Coke was already half dead!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Coke! Coke! Coke!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get rid of that beggar!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Coke was upset because of their cheers and fighting atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Please figure out the atmosphere!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t want to be killed by bones and peas in front of Patrian’s users, who looked up to him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Coke nervously looked at Piaro, but Piaro had no interest in him. He dismissed Coke at the level of a flying insect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid felt admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you just do? It looks like you dealt big damage with the bone and pea?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The user with the ID of Coke, based on the items he wore, he had a minimum level of 100. In addition, his armor had at least a rare rating.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was amazing that Coke coughed up blood after being hit by a bean.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro explained to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I used qi. I can maximize my power by injecting qi into an object. In my hands, even a feather can become a sharp sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is like a wuxia master.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wuxia? What is that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Strong people like you who transform the world.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid and Piaro didn’t care about the other people making a fuss.&nbsp;</span><span style>The users became increasingly furious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That beggar is ignoring us until the end...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Coke didn’t take action, so the level 78th monk called Pitu and the level 85 berserker Dais rose from their seats. As they were approaching Piaro, the door of the inn suddenly opened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sir Dio is coming!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dozens of soldiers rushed into the narrow inn.&nbsp;</span><span style>They stood and saluted as a white armored knight entered.&nbsp;</span><span style>The young man had particularly noticeable blonde eyelashes.&nbsp;</span><span style>He looked around the inn with narrowed eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It stinks. Are people eating worse than pigs? It’s incredibly stinky.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Dio held a blue rose in one hand and raised it to his nose. He smelled it and asked.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Has anyone here seen Duke Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duke Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is he talking about God Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were no high level monsters near Patrian. It was because the knights and soldiers of Patrian used the monsters to train.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why would they be looking for a high level user in Patrian?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No. Why would God Grid come to this type of place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You really don’t know.”&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, Dio started to examine the users’ faces for Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>“You’re not it. You also aren’t it. You as well. Um...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dio’s gaze went to a corner.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a beginner adventurer sitting next to a beggar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Take your hat off. Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dio approached Grid and commanded, only to become terrified. It was because of an enormous stench that spread.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dirty guy...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dio was a noble and a knight, so he had an unusually obsessive temperament about being clean.&nbsp;</span><span style>He became furious at Piaro, who hadn’t taken a bath for at least a month.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How dare you go around in such a disgusting manner! What a shameless bastard! My nose will become paralyzed because of you! Don’t make me nauseous and go away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The users annoyed by Piaro thought this was a cool remark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid rose from his seat.&nbsp;</span><span style>He judged that it would be better to leave because Earl Ashur seemed to have noticed him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don’t want to delay the time.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The big city Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had tremendous expectations about his city. He wanted to arrive quickly and check how much taxes he would get.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dio caught up with Grid who was trying to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Didn’t I tell you to take off your hat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...The boat might’ve already sailed.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid grinned at Dio and asked.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Do you really think that I am Duke Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dio bluntly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right. I received a tip that Duke Grid was here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s face distorted.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Then why are you speaking like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An enormous pressure was released.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dio, the soldiers and the users in the inn were overwhelmed by the pressure and hesitated.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because Grid’s dignity stat was comparable to the king of a nation.&nbsp;</span><span style>He threw off his hat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“G-Grid...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“God Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dio was astonished, while the other users cried out.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid pressed his finger to Dio’s forehead.&nbsp;</span><span style>“If you knew I was Duke Grid, why did you speak without using honorifics? Eh? What did you originally say? Did you call me a bastard? Eh? Are we friends?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had bad feelings towards Earl Ashur’s knights as well.&nbsp;</span><span style>The one who killed Grid when he acquired Pagma’s Rare Book wasn’t Earl Ashur, but Earl Ashur’s knights. And Dio was one of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I tried to endure it, but this bastard is too arrogant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid couldn’t suppress his rage and slapped Dio.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a terrible experience for Dio, who had never even been scolded by his parents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Y-You hit me...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He bit his lips as Grid hit Dio’s cheeks again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You didn’t even apologize for not bowing! This rude bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had matured after several incidents, but the roots of a human didn’t easily change.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s natural tendencies weren’t good.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid slapped Dio in front of all these people, without considering Dio’s position at all.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Slap!</span></i> <i><span style>Slap!</span></i> <i><span style>Slap!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dio’s handsome face quickly swelled up like a toad.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, Dio’s string of reason snapped.&nbsp;</span><span style>He grabbed his sword, forgetting Earl Ashur’s order to ‘graciously’ bring Grid to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Such humiliation...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What? Do you dare to show disrespect to a duke? You want to be like this until the end?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s eyes shone.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the same as when he was called the Psychopath Butcher.&nbsp;</span><span style>"You are sentenced to death."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He swung Failure.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dio couldn’t cope with a single strike and was thrown back into the wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Cough! Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldiers panicked as they watched Dio coughing up blood.&nbsp;</span><span style>Should they protect their leader? But wasn’t that considered a rebellion against the duke?&nbsp;</span><span style>As the soldiers were troubled, the cool blade was held to Dio’s jaw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you remember that day?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That day...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The day that I found Pagma’s Rare Book.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I clearly remember.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dio couldn’t forget, since it was the day that Earl Ashur’s anger pierced the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid gritted his teeth,&nbsp;</span><span style>"On that day, I was killed by your swords. I will give you a chance to experience the same pain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike a user who would resurrect if they died, the life of a NPC was finite.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>In Satisfy, killing an NPC was equivalent to murder in reality.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was unwilling to harm an NPC. It was even more so after forming a relationship with Khan. Due to that, he didn’t intend to kill Dio and was just planning to terrify him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Dio became honestly scared and pissed himself. He started foaming at the mouth and lost consciousness.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an event that would become a lifelong trauma for Dio, who had been an elite since childhood.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems strange if you’re the duke of the kingdom.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro remarked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid shrugged.&nbsp;</span><span style>"This was a dirty case. I have a bad chemistry with this place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"So that’s why you hid your identity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two people left the inn and were moving to exit Patrian.&nbsp;</span><span style>Coke rushed after them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid! Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Can’t you see that I am moving in secret? Why are you calling out the name of a person without thinking?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-I’m really sorry. I was so excited that I wasn’t thinking...”&nbsp;</span><span style>Coke took out a piece of paper and asked Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Please sign this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Sign?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s distorted expression disappeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Are you my fan?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You’re my idol! I want to be just like you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hmm hmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was an idol.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had been ignored by others for his whole life, so he had to be thrilled.&nbsp;</span><span style>He signed Coke’s piece of paper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the moment when Coke, who would be included in the next 10 Rookies, became Grid’s real fan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Earl Ashur received the news about Dio.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I can’t leave this alone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The embarrassment of his subordinate was the embarrassment of the owner!&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Ashur became more furious at Grid and grasped his exact position with the magic spheres. Then he used Mass Teleport on him and his knights.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid stopped as he was leaving Patrian.&nbsp;</span><span style>He saw the light from the sky and Ashur appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"In the end, you came here. Do you really want to die? Are you crazy?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Ashur angrily asked Grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not like I was in the past. I’m no longer to be trifled with. Can you afford to go against me?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid asked arrogantly, and Earl Ashur scoffed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’m the only great magician in the Eternal Kingdom, and one of the 10 great magicians on the continent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t an exaggeration.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Ashur was the strongest man in the kingdom. That’s why he was appointed to the strategic point of Patrian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’m not afraid of Pagma’s power. You aren’t Pagma. I have enough skills to get rid of you... Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Ashur suddenly became shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because an overwhelming amount of energy was being emitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I would like to compete with one of the 10 great magicians of the continent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the moment when Piaro’s competitive spirit was triggered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"W-Who are you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Ashur could no longer worry about Grid due to the unexpected emergence of a monster. It was putting the cart before the horse.</span></p>
