 <p><span style>Chapter 318</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as the blue greatsword and hand plow collided, Piaro’s eyes widened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Heavy!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s swordsmanship was rough. It wasn’t outstanding. However, his high strength and agility wrecked considerable havoc.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How far has he come?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro had experience teaching Grid. He knew more than anyone that Grid was dull-witted.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even though he inherited the legendary skills, Piaro was confident that a rapid growth wasn’t possible for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he was mistaken.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s growth rate was comparable to the geniuses that Piaro recognized, Regas and Ibellin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Now!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The synergy between the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch and his high insight exploded.&nbsp;</span><span style>As Piaro was feeling confused, Grid’s eye flashed red and he shook the hand plow off Failure. At this point, Grid’s greatsword moved horizontally.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro groaned.&nbsp;</span><span style>A powerful shock was delivered despite the defense of the plow.&nbsp;</span><span style>Blacksmith’s Rage and the buff on the pavranium meant that Grid’s attack power currently surpassed Chris.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, Grid’s high agility gave him wings.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Jjang!</span></i> <i><span style>Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In the time it took Chris to attack twice, Grid had attacked three times.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro was very surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was surprising since Grid was predicted to be below Chris’ level.&nbsp;</span><span style>But this surprise didn’t last long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had one lacking point.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was his understanding of swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris executed a trajectory that forced the enemy’s movement to slow, while Grid was just fast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First, defend and then pierce through the gap. Piaro turned to the left, aiming his hand plow at Grid’s left shoulder.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an attack that precisely aimed for the weak point, but something unexpected happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A golden blade flew and guarded Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro blocked the attack and was amazed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Indeed!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A legendary blacksmith. Grid made up for his lack of swordsmanship with tools.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, didn’t the golden blade stiffen from one strike?&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro didn’t consider the pavranium to be a variable.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was a natural judgment. It was too early to express this as carelessness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But who was Grid?&nbsp;</span><span style>Once again, he was a legendary blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span style>He transcended predictions with his items.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro had been the strongest ever since he became a great swordsman.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was considered invincible and rarely experienced a fright.&nbsp;</span><span style>The golden blade went stiff after protecting Grid’s shoulder.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then it launched Magic Missile!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a completely unexpected type of attack.&nbsp;</span><span style>He never imagined that magic would come from the blade.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Grid leapt forward through that gap.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Once the attack was blocked, he took advantage of the rebound and swung Grid’s Greatsword. It was an exciting linked combo.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood dripped down Piaro’s chest.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the damage didn’t seem to be great and there was no shaking in his posture.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid knew how robust he was and linked the attacks without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slashing and a descending cut.&nbsp;</span><span style>Landing and then a horizontal slash.&nbsp;</span><span style>The subsequent counterattack was defended by Failure and then countered with Grid’s Greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>He succeeded in a total of five attacks with Grid’s Greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the option of Grid’s Greatsword was activated, making the fifth attack a critical attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 22,900 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Ridiculously durable.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person wounded was Piaro, but Grid was the one who felt surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because Piaro’s defensive power exceeded Elfin Stone’s, despite him only wearing simple clothes.&nbsp;</span><span style>His health must be at least 300,000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro was a legendary farmer, so he now had significantly higher stats than when he was a great swordsman. In addition, he raised his level through continuous training.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro’s current level was 405, which was 38 levels higher than when Grid observed him with the Great Lord's Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was only level 301, so his attacks couldn’t deal proper damage. This was a judgment based on level that the system decided by default.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro expressed his respect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am proud of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Had he been working hard since the day he struggled with Pagma’s doppelganger?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have to salute My Lord, who has done your best despite your lack of talent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Piaro’s loyalty has soared to the peak.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The absolute trust in his lord has increased Piaro’s willingness and opened up his potential. Piaro’s stats will permanently increase by 10%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid would normally be glad about the notification windows.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now was an exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"W-Wait a minute!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro should become stronger after the battle!&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t have time to put that thought in his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Free Farming 1st Style, Sowing.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pa pa pa pat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro sprinkled dozens of seeds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pavranium responded because it was aimed at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Out of the 27 pavranium, four of the pavranium turned into blades had been mixed with the Water Clan King’s Tears. The remaining 23 were the basic form, showing a weak defense. They couldn’t fully defend against all the seeds sowed around Grid and stiffened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 9,320 damage.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This damn thing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was hit by a rice seed that penetrated through the stiff pavranium and screamed.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past, a low level user in Patrian was hit by a bone and died. Now Grid was in the same position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Free Farming 2nd Style, Rapid Growth.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaduk!</span></i> <i><span style>Kudududuk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After hitting the pavranium or Grid, the seeds on the floor started growing rapidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid freaked out as he saw the rice growing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is a power that only a legendary farmer can exert.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro’s will was firm.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a legendary farmer, he wasn’t incompetent. So he wanted to be acknowledged.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid couldn’t accept it.&nbsp;</span><span style>No matter how strong a legendary farmer, he couldn’t get rid of the idea that a sword saint was better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Link!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A sword dance was quickly unfolded.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pit!</span></i> <i><span style>Pipipipipit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dozens of attacks flew out and scattered the rice plants.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid and Piaro’s eyes met.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Free Farming!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The air around Grid sank heavily. The intense aura around Grid was concentrated at the end of the greatsword, making the target feel an extreme threat.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the manifestation of Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro’s skill was even more amazing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“6th Style! Flailing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The plow was replaced by a flail.&nbsp;</span><span style>It ruthlessly struck Grid’s Greatsword that was aiming for his chest.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepeok!</span></i> <i><span style>Bam bam bam!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because the energy of Kill was unable to bear the power of the flail and dissipated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is crazy!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flailing!&nbsp;</span><span style>One of his strongest skills was disabled by a farming technique.&nbsp;</span><span style>The thing that made him even more irate was that the old flail Piaro was using was a rare rated farming tool that Grid made a few months ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>In contrast, his weapon was legendary rated!</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Shit!'</span></p>
 <p><span style>It felt like he was grain hit by a flail.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro’s skill wasn’t just strong. It also had a tendency to break the enemy’s self-esteem. It was very powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He might be a farmer, but a legend is a legend. This is pretty amazi... No, no.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t acknowledge Piaro as a farmer. Piaro should only be a sword saint.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid barely recovered from his confusion and gave orders to four pavranium blades that contained Magic Missile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Shoot from all directions!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pavranium only followed Grid’s will.&nbsp;</span><span style>They immediately reacted by surrounding Piaro and firing Magic Missile all at once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This basic magic isn’t a threat to me!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro was caught off guard before, but not now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro demonstrated the hidden technique of Free Farming, ‘Natural State.’ Then the earth, air, trees and everything in nature gave him strength, causing his stats to rise dramatically. It was natural that his magic resistance would also increase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it was useless.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Magic Missile (Enhanced) Grid received from Braham completely ignored the target’s magic resistance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite the use of Natural State, Piaro suffered a lot of damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'What is with the strength of this magic?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro had fought with Earl Ashur, one of the 10 great magicians of the continent.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Earl Ashur didn’t have magic that was this fast and powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The magic of an artifact transcends that of a great magician...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>His lord was truly great.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro felt sincere respect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Grid was cursing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Dammit.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was able to add magic to pavranium thanks to the Water Clan King’s Tears sent by Euphemina, but there was a problem.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to deploy the Magic Missile attributed to the pavranium, Grid’s mana was consumed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Malacus’ Cloak and the Black Quartz Earrings increased Grid’s intelligence, giving him mana close to 16,000.&nbsp;</span><span style>The mana cost of the legendary skills was very high, so it was too much to use both Pagma’s Swordsmanship and Magic Missile (Enhanced).</span></p>
 <p><span style>But in this situation, Piaro became even stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Natural State...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It amplified his stats, like Braham’s Magic Drain.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an excellent legendary buff skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘On the other hand, my Blacksmith’s Rage...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blacksmith's Rage was based on sympathizing with blacksmiths!&nbsp;</span><span style>It couldn’t be denied that it was a great buff that increased attack damage and attack speed, but the disadvantage was that the duration was too short.&nbsp;</span><span style>The skill at level 5 only lasted for 35 seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro’s Natural State and Braham’s Magic Drain were undeniably better.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepeok!</span></i> <i><span style>Bam bam bam!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Ugh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would Blacksmith's Rage one day be reborn to match a legendary skill?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s thinking was broken by Piaro’s flail.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid tried to defend, but it was difficult. The flail was light, its attack speed was fast and its trajectory was irregular.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is a joke...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro was very fast after using Natural State. He avoided all the Magic Missiles fired by the pavranium again.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was distressed about the one-sided beating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If only I had two more hands...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would be able to resist Piaro’s flail and also reverse the situation by using Item Combination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Ah?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was struck with an epiphany.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yes, hands!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hands of a legendary blacksmith!&nbsp;</span><span style>What if he could reproduce these great hands with the pavranium?&nbsp;</span><span style>Just imagine it! The legendary blacksmith hands that moved according to his command.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During combat, he could use multiple items, maximizing the power of his items. In addition, they could be his substitute for the long activation time of Item Combination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can make several items at the same time, so the efficiency of my work will increase!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>...Irene would also be pleased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smiled with satisfaction and called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Time! Wait! Stop! I said stop!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not admitting defeat in a battle, just stopping?&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro stopped moving his flail. It was truly great loyalty.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid shouted to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s fight again tomorrow!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was too careless today. Even if Piaro was a farmer, he was still a legend.&nbsp;</span><span style>Tomorrow, if Grid lost again despite his full preparations...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘At that time, I will respect your choice.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s eyes were filled with confidence.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reason why he felt confident despite not reducing Piaro’s health by one-tenth today was because he had absolute faith.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had faith in his items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, a legend of the new era started to evolve. He was in the process of catching up to the legends of the previous generation and overcoming them.</span></p>
