 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>There were various hunting grounds for level 100~200 users in the vicinity of Bairan Village.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to that, there was a steady floating population of users.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the population was small, so the development speed was slow and there was the big city Winston in the area, so users were reluctant to live in Bairan Village.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The number of residents, including NPCs and users, was only around 500 people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The event effect of Grid and Lady Irene’s marriage meant that Bairan Village was enjoying a boom.&nbsp;</span><span style>Over the past week, a large number of people moved in and there were now around 5,000 people in Bairan Village.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Tzedakah Guild used their funds to hire technicians in the north to quickly build homes and facilities, as well as experts in various fields. Thus, the village was rapidly developing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a completely different scale from when I came last month.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. There were only a few small houses and stores, and now there are big buildings?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The users who visited Bairan after a long time were impressed. Hundreds of workmen were setting up buildings, making it a spectacular sight.&nbsp;</span><span style>Once all the buildings were completed, it seemed like Bairan could be called a city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Despite the rapid development, the security is excellent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is managed by the Tzedakah Guild. What crazy person would mess around with the Tzedakah Guild?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m envious of the Tzedakah Guild... Don’t they have the best estate among all the guilds? They will be sitting on a cushion of money very quickly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is all thanks to Lady Irene’s marriage. The marriage happened with exquisite timing for the Tzedakah Guild.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s her husband?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How should I know? Probably some noble.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The streets were flooded with people, despite the fact that most users were at the hunting grounds.&nbsp;</span><span style>If NPCs were included, there were approximately 2,000 people always in residence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh? What’s that?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’s terrific magic power.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Among the users doing their business, the high level magicians turned their attention to the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Tzedakah Guild had built high buildings in Bairan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Magic power was being generated at the tallest spire of the castle that stood in the middle of the village.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first, the scale seemed small, but rapidly expanded. Then the identity of the magic was determined.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the precursor to a mass teleport.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow... Isn’t that only available for third advancement magicians?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this? An event?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh, right! It’s an event!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kyah! what is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was amazing.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hundreds of rays of light were fired from the movement gate and fell like a meteor towards different part of the village.&nbsp;</span><span style>The users were excited because they thought it was a special event in connection with the national competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>But their cheers turned to screams in seconds.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The infidels, punish them in the name of God!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Show the fools the greatness of God Yatan!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaang!</span></i> <i><span style>Kukwakwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The identity of the people who fell from the rays of light were the Yatan believers.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were more than 1,000 of them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Black magic was used everywhere, instantly filling Bairan Village with poison fog.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"H-Hik...!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aaaaack! H-Help me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The buildings that the Tzedakah Guild invested time and money in were eroded in an instant.&nbsp;</span><span style>The pretty flowers and green trees blooming on the streets became black and corrupted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>There were fires everywhere and blood flowed like a river, making it like hell itself. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the hell is going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The average level of &nbsp;the users in Bairan Village was 140.&nbsp;</span><span style>As of February 20XX, Satisfy’s users had an average level of 93, which meant that users in Bairan were fairly high levelled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the Yatan followers had a minimum level of 160.&nbsp;</span><span style>Around 1,000 such people appeared simultaneously, as well as 200 high ranking elders that were at least level 200.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't fight! You will just die if you fight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Damn! What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of the 2,000 people residing in Bairan Village, only half of them were users. The other half were NPCs that lacked combat capabilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is divine punishment!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kyaaaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Die! Infidels!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ugh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a sudden raid. The Yatan Church’ followers were overwhelming. The NPCs died in an instant while the users went on the defensive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit! Logout!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will leave as well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The users who were already attacked by the followers weren’t allowed to log out, because they were judged to be in combat, but the other users logged out quickly.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thus, the number of users fighting against the Yatan followers was less than 300.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wah...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How rotten! We are outnumbered! Outnumbered!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 1,000 Yatan followers fought. They attacked everyone they saw, regardless if they were NPCs or users.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Save the people!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Helplessness! A force that swept everything away!&nbsp;</span><span style>The victims grew as the Yatan believers were like surging waves.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the one-sided damage didn’t last long.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was thank to the Tzedakah Guild’s excellent response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What? Someone dares attack in my area? Kyaaack~ spit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toon was easily controlled by Jishuka due to his simple nature.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was head of security in Bairan Village and led the knights and soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"All of you protect the people. Kyaaack~ spit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He ordered the knights and soldiers, before spitting out of habit and jumping into the enemies alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Yatan followers?&nbsp;</span><span style>They were just a joke in front of a rare class who was 35th on the unified rankings, ‘Beasts of Prey’ Toon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"King of the Beasts!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toon crossed his long arms equipped with wristblades and used a skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then his body changed into a lion. He was almost twice as large as an ordinary male lion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Heok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aaaaack~!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Yatan followers started to scream.&nbsp;</span><span style>Every time the enormous lion’s paws were swung, bones would break. In addition, the fangs chewed on skulls, killing the believers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shackles of darkness will press on your body!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While their peers were being attacked, the elders used black magic to summon magic shackles. Then they tied up the body of the great lion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lord of Heaven!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toon was unable to endure the dozens of shackles and used another skill. Then his body became smaller and turned into an eagle.&nbsp;</span><span style>The shackles became too loose and Toon escaped through the gap. Then he descended from the sky and his beak pierced the head of a follower.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the same time, he changed into a lion and roared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuweeeeeoh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kiyaaaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dozens of believers had blood pouring from their ears as they sat down.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toon attacked the necks of the people in pain and they turned into light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuhahahaha! Rejoice! Fighting is fun!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Mister Toon... His personality is strange, but his skills are great.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the walls.&nbsp;</span><span style>Laella, the 2nd ranked mixed magician, stared blankly at Toon who was facing the enemies alone before grasping her orb.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the Dark Magic Orb that was acquired after the Malacus raid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Laella amplified her magic by borrowing its power and fired magic towards the Yatan followers surrounding the soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wrath of the Red Witch.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kakakakak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A powerful pillar was fired in a straight line. The bodies of the believers were instantly burned.&nbsp;</span><span style>The soldiers were saved and thanked Laella. Then they moved and started to save the people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The east gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hrmm, are you the cream of the crop?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner, who had been hunting with a grudge against Grid, ran over after receiving the command.&nbsp;</span><span style>He saw three users dying in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Go to hell and become God Yatan’s eternal servant!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elders of the Yatan Church wore black robes and were shouting at the users.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner rushed forward and wielded his twin axes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keook!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bodies of the believers were cut in half and they turned into grey light.&nbsp;</span><span style>The saved users were thrilled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The number one guardian knight, you protected us! I will boast about it on the Internet!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You’re as strong as rumored, Vantner!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hehe, it isn’t such a big deal... Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner had suffered for a while due to Grid treating him as an insignificant person, so he was pleased about being praised by the users. He was scratching his bald head and laughing when he found Jishuka on the roof of a three-storey building.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three Yatan elders were approaching behind her while she was busy shooting at the believers.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unlike the ordinary believers, they were wearing robes of different colors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘High ranking believers!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner moved quickly. Then he successfully saved Jishuka, who expressed her disapproval.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aren’t you late?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka’s white teeth contrasted with her tanned skin. Vantner gave her a thumbs up and shouted,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Leave it to me and just kill all of them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Okay."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Swaeek!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Truly an expert archer.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t help admiring her marksmanship every time he saw it.&nbsp;</span><span style>The arrow flew 100m and pierced a follower who was about to murder some residents. Then she fired towards the roof of another building and turned five people chanting a spell into a skewer with only one arrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the basics.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka was satisfied with her abilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Magicians! Kill the magicians!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Five high ranking believers moved at once. Their targets were Laella and Zednos, who continued to cast magic from the walls.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then a cold voice was heard in their ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You should always watch your back."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The believers screamed. Someone was behind them?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Suddenly...? Keok...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faker.&nbsp;</span><span style>He slit the throats of the five high ranking followers.&nbsp;</span><span style>Blood poured from their throats and the believers collapsed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Next...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sururuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Faker turned his gaze to one side and disappeared using his Stealth skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don’t need to worry about the others.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The north gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A boy with a pretty appearance like a girl stood there.&nbsp;</span><span style>He listened to the screams coming from all directions and moved to one side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside a burning mansion.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were people present.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“S-Shit...! What is this? Does it make sense to come to this village, only to die? This is truly unfair!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"All my hard earned experience will drop...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why do I have to die in this village? Please help...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Four high ranking elders were driving six users into a corner.&nbsp;</span><span style>The users were seriously injured and about to die, so they were crying or begging for their lives.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tadat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ibellin’s running speed increased. He moved through the open door and jumped on a chair on one side. He fell between the users and believers.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he pulled out a flamberge that was like the thorny stem of a rose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You alone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ibellin replied to the believers,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Overgeared No.2.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the name that Vantner gave him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Recently, Vantner had been sarcastically calling Pon Overgeared No.1 and Ibellin Overgeared No.2.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ibellin loved this name.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The strongest flamberge, the Thorn of Deep Grievance was wielded.&nbsp;</span><span style>The followers reacted quickly and avoided a deep injury.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This wound... Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A follower’s face turned blue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It was became the small cut was bleeding in an unbelievable manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A magic sword!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The followers retreated, on guard against the Thorn of Deep Grievance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ibellin didn’t let them go. He chased after them persistently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It isn’t a magic sword. It’s just cursed.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk!</span></i> <i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Due to its distinctive shape, the sword move bizarrely, making it difficult to gauge the scope of the attack.&nbsp;</span><span style>Blood rose like a fountain as screams echoed in the house.</span></p>
