 <p><span style>Chapter 420</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kurururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The mountain wasn’t able to cope with the explosion generated by Transcended Link and collapsed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Russians showed their skills as the stones poured down like hail.&nbsp;</span><span style>Transcended Link was a non-targeted skill, so it could be avoided with control, while Linked Kill Wave could be countered with a corresponding skill.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, third advancement classes were different.&nbsp;</span><span style>The two second advancement users were unable to cope with Transcended Link properly, while the four third advancement classes handled Linked Kill Wave.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were hit by the landslide, but they moved their bodies properly and avoided a fatal injury. They were different from small fries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Among them, the 22nd ranked Alexander was a military student.&nbsp;</span><span style>He focused on the small shields hanging on both wrists and hardened them, completely neutralizing the strike of Linked Kill Wave.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wasn’t a tanker, so it was probably a skill to neutralize techniques.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed, you’re a monster.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alexander shook his hands like it was numb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If it’s just the power of the skill alone, you are stronger than Kraugel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aren’t your total abilities below me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alexander had also participated in the National Competition last year.&nbsp;</span><span style>He saw Grid defeat Hurent and Bondre in succession, winning the PvP event.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the time, he had been honestly surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style>He realized that he couldn’t beat this yellow monkey and his pride was hurt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now it was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>Over the past year, Alexander had become stronger. He advanced faster than others.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid would also be stronger than last year, but Alexander was certain that he had a bigger growth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I also experienced the East Continent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the people who knew about the Behen Archipelago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this notorious instant dungeon, Alexander reached the 15th island and luckily found Fog Island. He bought a large number of elixirs and moved to the East Continent. There, he succeeded in countless quests, receiving all types of titles and a second class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"My current stats are around 400 points higher than the same level users. By hardening my aura, I can exert powerful attack power and defense at the same time. Can a monkey like you handle me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid listened to the story and laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alexander frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is funny?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"In my experience, talkative people like you usually die in one blow. I’m just curious about how many seconds it will take for you to die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an obvious provocation.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid noticed Alexander’s temper and taunted him.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Alexander was a surprisingly cool person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey monkey. I know that you’ve been a winner for a while. But keep this in mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The world was wide and there were many people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are more than two billion users in Satisfy. Why do only a few rankers participate in the National Competition to represent their country? You’re strong, but there are countless others in the world that you don’t know about.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The true users that were Kraugel’s level didn’t show up in the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why?&nbsp;</span><span style>They didn’t want to expose their power to the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They don’t crave anything enough to risk exposing themselves. They are complete products.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is your point?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Well, to put it simply, it means that the rankers who competed in the National Competition are only B-class. They are lacking many parts and are weak and pitiful beings who made a choice to expose their power. Don’t be so arrogant when you have only played against them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Hoh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a plausible logic.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had reasons for participating in the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>First of all, he wanted the world to acknowledge his abilities. Secondly, he wanted to obtain adamantium and promote Overgeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He wouldn’t have bothered participating in the National Competition if he had no purpose.&nbsp;</span><span style>In fact, Faker hadn’t participated in the National Competition for two years in a row.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid thought about it and came to a conclusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then Alexander, aren’t you also B-class? Are you giving me an advance warning before I knock you out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alexander snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I am A-class.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alexander was already strong enough. He knew it wasn’t ideal to fight in the National Competition and expose his power.&nbsp;</span><span style>Nevertheless, he participated in the National Competition for only one reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I participated in this competition for the glory of my country. Now, experience the power of an A-class. Be the cornerstone of Russia’s glory!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s eyes widened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was because something as sharp as thorns rose from the ground at his feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His high insight and the power of the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch meant Grid quickly detected the abnormality of the ground. Then he moved around with the agility he gained in the Behen Archipelago, avoiding the thorns.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The swift movements were more than Alexander anticipated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yes, this is the trinity of items, stats and skills.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alexander linked skills while admiring it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is useless! Aura Explosion!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The aura thorns that rose from the ground where Grid stood became hard. They exploded and caused damage to Grid...</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 680 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 599 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 605 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alexander’s eyes widened with surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What? Why isn’t the damage higher?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>That Grid, did he move quickly and get away from the blast radius?&nbsp;</span><span style>Alexander watched the dust caused by the explosion and belatedly realized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No, he didn’t avoid it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s defense was just absurdly high.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Overgeared...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first time that Grid appeared in front of the world in the past.&nbsp;</span><span style>He called himself overgeared when facing Neberius, a Yatan Servant.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a defense that made Alexander recall Grid’s intense first appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But it will eventually break!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alexander moved forward.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjeejeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Twin swords slashed through the air towards Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Grid didn’t have flying magic, he wouldn’t have been able to respond easily.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Grid was accustomed to Fly after nearly two years. He could move as freely in the sky as he could on the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was relatively easy to block Alexander’s swords.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Grid was armed with a greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was common sense that his attack speed would be slow.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid’s attack speed was very fast.&nbsp;</span><span style>The attack speed was between that of a one-handed sword and a greatsword, so it was hard to defend against.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Even the destructive power...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alexander barely defended with his shield, but he couldn’t bear the weight of the greatsword. He fell to the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid immediately rushed towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the empty air, he moved while using Link.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pit!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pipipipipit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A quick swordsmanship that made it hard to believe it came from a greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dozens of black lights appeared around Alexander’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid believed that dozens of strikes would emerge from Alexander’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a maneuver to deal with Link.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Alexander wasn’t an ordinary person.&nbsp;</span><span style>As soon as Grid used Link, he developed an aura tornado, creating a barrier of aura around his body and making it harder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Link hit the aura barrier and it broke.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid and Alexander’s gazes met through hundreds of scattered aura fragments.&nbsp;</span><span style>Alexander laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Louder than before! Aura Explosion!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puaaaaaaaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid groaned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the first pained expression he made after the target processing started.&nbsp;</span><span style>It would be difficult to cope with the damage caused by the simultaneous explosion of dozens of aura fragments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the power of an A-class!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alexander took advantage of the momentum to hit Grid’s chest with his left hand, while pushing the sword in his right hand into Grid’s abdomen.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t a weak attack.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid’s items were much better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Largest Gloves have reduced physical damage by 4%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Shiny Gauntlets have reduced physical damage by 5%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Heavy Helmet has reduced physical damage by 6%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Lantier’s Cloak has reduced the damage of all stabbing and cutting attacks by 20%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Triple Layers has reduced physical damage by 4%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Triple Layers has reduced the damage of stabbing attacks by 50%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The enemy’s sword is caught in the gap of Three Layers. The skill ‘Sword Breaker’ is used.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The target’s weapon durability has dropped.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwajijik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"...What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alexander paled.&nbsp;</span><span style>The durability of his swords decreased severely just from cutting and stabbing Grid. It even got stuck.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was like dealing with a named golem boss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid told him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you are A-class, then I am S-class?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Damn items...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alexander removed his sword and attacked Grid again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the manifestation of his strongest attack skill, ‘Exceed Sword,’ which concentrated hardened aura at the end of the sword. Exceed Sword had the option of ignoring a certain amount of the enemy’s defenses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t avoid it. To be honest, it was difficult to avoid it. He didn’t bother wasting strength and just let it hit.&nbsp;</span><span style>He believed in the Heavy Helmet, Largest Gloves, Shiny Gauntlets, Triple Layers, and Lantier’s Cloak, which had high resistance to physical attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, his items certainly paid back Grid’s faith.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 8,144 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is ridiculous!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alexander’s strongest attack skill only did this much damage? The durability of his sword was further reduced.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid struck the miserable Alexander.&nbsp;</span><span style>Alexander couldn’t avoid it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid used a skill the moment he welcomed the attack, so there was no time to avoid it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Linked Kill pierced Alexander’s heart before Alexander could recover his sword.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Alexander did his best to the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He succeeded in defending against the first strike of Linked Kill with his hardened aura shield. But Grid’s Linked Kill was a skill that hit the target at least three times. Luckily, this time it was six strikes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alexander couldn’t deal with the overwhelming power exerted by Grid’s Greatsword + Failure and turned to grey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Russian representatives were speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They never imagined that Alexander, who was the next strongest after Kraugel, would lose against Grid. Frankly speaking, they expected Alexander to crush Grid. But the result was the opposite.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Grid said to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Am I still a dog?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Russian representatives shook their heads.</span></p>
