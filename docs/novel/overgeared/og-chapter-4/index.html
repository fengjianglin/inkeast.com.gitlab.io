 <p><span style>Chapter 4</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style> ‘The minus level isn’t a bug.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The numbers in parentheses beside the level indicated my current experience and the amount of experience required to reach the next level.&nbsp;</span><span style>The existence of this experience figure meant that I could level up.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the worst case, I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to level up because I was bugged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m glad it isn’t a bug...’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>I still felt upset.&nbsp;</span><span style>Think about it: my level was originally over 70, but now I was lower than even new players who had just created their characters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I have to endure this.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I braced myself. It might take time, but I could raise my level again.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reason for this positive thinking was due to the qualities of my profession and title.&nbsp;</span><span style>I didn’t know anything about item creation, so I couldn’t comment on the probability of adding additional options, but it was still good to have.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'The odds of enhancement will increase.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Satisfy, items could be enhanced up to +10.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the price of the materials needed for enhancement was expensive. In addition, the higher the enhancement number and item rating, the lower the probability of the enhancement succeeding.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, if the enhancement was successful, the enhancement value would be +1; however, if it failed, it would be -3.&nbsp;</span><span style>The price for items with an enhancement of +6 would rise exponentially.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don’t know how much the probability has risen, but can’t I feel hope for a large amount of money?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both of the class characteristics that I mentioned were quite attractive.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, my bigger interest was that all items could be worn unconditionally.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was an unreasonable merit. Depending on the penalties that were applied, this attribute could disrupt the balance of the game.</span></p>
 <p><span style>’Isn’t this a fraudulent class attribute?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of the equipment items in Satisfy had conditions of use attached to them. If the conditions weren’t met, the item couldn’t be worn.&nbsp;</span><span style>For that reason, every level had strong limitations.&nbsp;</span><span style>But that didn’t apply to me, due to the nature of my class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Really?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I opened my inventory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Mamon’s Greatsword]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 88/204 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Power: 178~301 &nbsp;&nbsp;Attack Speed: -16%</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Additional water damage will be added to all critical attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This is the greatsword patronized by the guardian of Lake Pamian, Mamon. Due to the influence of the lake, this sword has the strong aura of water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Conditions of Use: Level 65 or higher, more than 260 strength, more than 150 stamina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 1,050</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Mengel’s Plate Armor]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Rare</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 51/180 &nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 165 &nbsp;Movement Speed: -2%</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Strength +10</span></p>
 <p><span style>This is a work made by the blacksmith Mengel in the fortified city of Patrian. With it, the defense is improved and the weight lowered. The wearer of this work can feel Mengel’s strong willpower that remained behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Conditions of Use: Level 60 or higher, more than 180 strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 1,203&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>My current stats didn’t meet the conditions of use attached to Mamon’s Greatsword or Mengel's Plate Armor.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, a normal person wouldn’t be able to wear both items.&nbsp;</span><span style>But I was the exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Due to your class characteristics, you have equipped Mamon’s Greatsword.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A penalty is applied because the item conditions aren’t met.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Attack power of Mamon’s Greatsword will decrease by 30%. Only half of the option effects will be applied.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The penalties will be reduced if your understanding of Mamon’s Greatsword increases.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Due to your class characteristics, you have equipped Mengel's Plate Armor.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A penalty is applied because the item conditions aren’t met.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Defense of Mengel's Plate Armor’s will decrease by 20%. Only half of the option effects will be applied.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The penalties will be reduced if your understanding of Mengel's Plate Armor’ increases.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Amazing...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy rarely had items with no usage conditions.&nbsp;</span><span style>I recalled a set of beginner items that were representative of having no conditions.&nbsp;</span><span style>I didn’t remember it exactly, but in the case of the beginner’s greatsword received at level 1, the attack power was 5~13 and the defense of the beginner’s armor was 7.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now I could use a weapon capable of at least 124 to 210 attack power, and 132 defense at level one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Won’t it be surprisingly easy to recover my level?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how low my level was, I could hunt monsters around level 20 with just the attack power of Mamon’s Greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to Mengel's Plate Armor, I wouldn’t receive any damage from low-level monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, I could hunt monsters much more quickly and easily than other users at the same level, thanks to the item effect. This would be directly linked to leveling up at the speed of light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The basic penalties system is that rare items have a drop of 20% in the basic abilities, while epic items have a 30% drop. Only half of the item effects are applied...'&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The penalties were surprisingly small. Unique and legendary ranked items would be subjected to more penalties, but at this point, it was a sufficiently fraudulent ability.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is a legendary class...! But what is understanding?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to my excitement, I belatedly noticed the bit about ‘understanding’ that appeared in the notification windows. Then I checked the detailed information.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Item Understanding]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagma’s Descendant can understand the materials and principles of the item by using, disassembling, or repairing the equipment items. The higher the level of understanding, the more efficiently one can handle the items. If you have a 100% understanding, you can learn how to make that item.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohu~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The higher my level of understanding, the fewer penalties there would be.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I will get the production method? Wow...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ordinary production users had to pay a large amount of money or complete hard questions to get the production methods.&nbsp;</span><span style>But I could get it for free, as long as I increased my understanding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'The repair skill is available and my item durability is low, so I will try and repair it later.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then I looked at the title attributes.&nbsp;</span><span style>In combat, the one thing players had to be most cautious of was an abnormal status, due to its ability to often reverse the state of a battle.&nbsp;</span><span style>By the way, my title lowered the probability of being affected by abnormal statuses.&nbsp;</span><span style>It also said that I wouldn’t die when my health was at the minimum, so I could be temporarily immortal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Easily acknowledged, does that mean my affinity with NPCs can be easily increased?'</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Puhuhut...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was happy. I was so happy that I couldn’t stop laughing.&nbsp;</span><span style>The class and title attributes alone gave me the feeling of being ahead of other regular users.&nbsp;</span><span style>I had become special. This felt like proper compensation for my three months of suffering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I would’ve enjoyed a much greater pleasure if I could’ve sold the book for money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I missed out on the opportunity to get rid of my creditors and to drive a foreign car!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I suddenly went from feeling good to feeling bad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"~#@….!^%*@…. Ashur!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I pounded the floor with frustration and resentment.&nbsp;</span><span style>I poured all out types of profanities towards Ashur. Gradually, my heart was soothed.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was due to an unfamiliar stat, so I decided to check it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Composure]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The probability of being affected by an abnormal state is lowered. If affected by an abnormal condition, you will recover quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The higher the number, the higher the effect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Stat points can’t be distributed to this stat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Indomitable]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Has a certain probability of invalidating a portion of the incoming damage. The lower the health, the higher the probability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The higher the number, the higher the effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Stat points can’t be distributed to this stat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Dignity]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Can’t be pushed down by others. There is a rare chance of making the enemy submit to you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The higher the number, the higher the effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Stat points can’t be distributed to this stat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Insight]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Discover the target. Predict risks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The higher the number, the higher the probability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Stat points can’t be distributed to this stat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every stat had a great effect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>'By the way, how am I going to raise the number if I can’t distribute points to it?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The explanation seemed huge, but they might be stats without much practical use.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment that I was about to open the skills window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aack!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>I screamed with fear. Something had suddenly touched my back.&nbsp;</span><span style>I belatedly recalled that I was in a Yatan Temple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-What!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I hurriedly turned around and reflexively wielded Mamon’s Greatsword. The man behind me dodged my attack and raised both hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey, calm down. Do you want to kill a person?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The one who spoke was a Caucasian-looking man who seemed to have an assassin type class due to his light equipment and agile body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>'His finger poked my back.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It might’ve be okay if it was a sword, but it was embarrassing to scream just because of a finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man shrugged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is dreary. Shouldn’t you apologize after trying to kill a person?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His smile looked like a smirk. I disliked this type of person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This person is speaking so impolitely at our first meeting.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Certainly, the man looked older than me. At first glance, he seemed to be in his mid-30s.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, my one year experience was enough to let me know how deceptive appearances were.&nbsp;</span><span style>I once called someone ‘Brother’, only to find out they were seven years older than me.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>This bastard, he looked like he was in his 30s but...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough.”&nbsp;</span><span style>My fists trembled and I barely managed to calm myself as I remembered the shameful past.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I’m sorry about that. But shouldn’t you apologize for poking me without notice and surprising me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man laughed and asked for a handshake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young man, I called out to you. However, you were so engrossed in thinking that you didn’t hear me. That is why I poked you. I’m sorry.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>I refused to shake hands with the man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"So why did you call me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man scratched his head and shrugged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"As you know, the Yatan Temple is filled with evil energy. Ordinary people will become afraid if they stay here for a while. But I observed you, and you are fine despite all the time that passed. In addition, you can even manage to laugh alone. You, don’t you actually have great abilities?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Perhaps this is...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As I got a hunch, I checked the name above the man’s head. The man’s eyes shone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My name is Doran. I am a shadow who secretly protects Earl Steim. One or two days after I had gone on vacation, the Earl’s esteemed daughter was kidnapped. I tracked her and found out that she was trapped in the basement of this temple. Won’t you lend me your strength? I will give you a remuneration for the request.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don’t...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I thought the man was a user, but he was actually an NPC.&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to the perfect artificial intelligence, the distinction between users and NPCs was ambiguous and this mistake sometimes occurred.&nbsp;</span><span style>The name above his head was green, symbolizing an NPC. Then a notification window about a quest popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Rescue the Earl’s Esteemed Daughter]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Difficulty: S</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene, the only daughter of Earl Steim, is a beautiful and innocent virgin. The elders of Yatan had kidnapped Irene in order to sacrifice her for her virgin blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Conditions: Rescue Irene within one hour after accepting the quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clear Reward: 3,000 gold, a low probability of becoming the earl’s son-in-law.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Earl’s son-in-law: Nobility stat will open, all stats +20.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You will be treated as a viscount after marrying the earl’s esteemed daughter. Power and honor will rise. You can advance into the social circle of the nobles. You will receive a monthly salary. This can be a shortcut to becoming a high-ranking official or lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Failure: Level -2.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Would you like to accept the quest?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was crazy.</span></p>
