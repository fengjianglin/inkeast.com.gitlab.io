 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>When they returned to Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The level difference between Reidan and the northern army was evident during the marching process.&nbsp;</span><span style>Reidan’s soldiers weren’t breathless at all, while the tired northern army was on the brink of collapse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The northern troops had made great sacrifices in the war, so were they exhausted because of mental weakness?</span></p>
 <p><span style>No.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the difference in basic stats.&nbsp;</span><span style>The northern army was regarded as one of the best in the Eternal Kingdom, but it wasn’t comparable to Reidan’s army, who had endured the hell training by Piaro and Asmophel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reidan’s soldiers not only had a high level, their strength and stamina also far exceeded the average. Moreover, their ability to adapt to the terrain was so high that it was difficult to see them as soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I would like to get a copy of the soldier training method of Reidan.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Laden was feeling impressed with Reidan’s army, Grid spoke to Asmophel in the lead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Asmophel, you had a hard time training the army. Thanks to your hard work, I was able to win easier in the this war.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You're overpraising me, My Lord. In addition, the military training wasn’t done solely by me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, it isn’t too much praise. The difference between the royal army and Reidan’s army is as big as the sky and the earth. This was my chance to get to know your abilities. And Piaro? Doesn’t he usually spend his days in the field? You are a hundred times better than him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My Lord...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After serving Grid, Asmophel had been in the shadows without performing well.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was afraid that he would never be seen by Grid, but this was groundless.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid recognized his efforts and acknowledged his abilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asmophel was thrilled and exclaimed,&nbsp;</span><span style>“I will work hard to achieve your goals in the future!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, good. Continue to focus on training the army.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asmophel’s official position was head of the Overgeared Knights Division 2.&nbsp;</span><span style>In fact, this didn’t mean training the soldiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The leaders of the knights division were supposed to performance high level missions.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, Asmophel played a pivotal role in the Saharan Empire, the strongest nation on the continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He wants me to continue the military training in the future?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The problem was that Asmophel wasn’t active.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘My Lord is still not aware of my skills.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>His position was being downgraded to a mere trainer?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid asked the anxious and frustrated Asmophel,&nbsp;</span><span style>“By the way, how much loot did you get?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...The royal army dropped 933 blades, 712 spears, 250 bows, 195 shields and 141 armor pieces.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that the end?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? That... They are all the items dropped by the royal soldiers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Weren’t there 4,000 casualties? So shouldn’t there be at least 4,000 items dropped?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like monsters and users, NPCs didn’t always drop items when they died. It was natural for there to be many cases of empty hands.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was well aware of this, but he still thought it was too low.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asmophel stayed silent and Grid asked Lauel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lauel, how much money did we win? You said we could sit on a pile of money if we took the spoils? But what is this? Were my expectations too high?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is a total of 2,090 normal rated level 130 equipment. 141 normal rated armor. If I calculate it at the minimum price, it is a profit of 25,000 gold... Sooner or later, you will become a building owner. Are you really going to dismiss this much money?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>25,000 gold was around 30 million won.&nbsp;</span><span style>The profit earned from half a day of fighting was enormous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can it be so much money?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Level 130 normal rated weapons are at least 10 gold, while armor is 30 gold. You can’t ignore quantity. If you melt all of it and use it as material to make items, you will be able to earn a bigger profit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...War is a good thing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Indeed. If you take advantage of war, not only can you gain loot, you can also establish a logistics business. It will be very beneficial to the economy. This is why the empire has been constantly fighting for hundreds of years.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then should we fight every day from now on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it that easy? Well, it is undeniable that Reidan is a territory optimized to serve as a base for war. There is a desert everywhere and monsters pop up in large quantities. We can also produce large amounts of food thanks to Piaro. It will be useful when it’s time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Piaro...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s face distorted as he heard that name.&nbsp;</span><span style>The person who had the role of commander didn’t participate in this war. It was scandalous the more he thought about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did he go to Altes Mountain just before there was a war? He used the excuse of just training one soldier. His timing is really great.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro had actually smashed the separate group led by Hurent that attacked in the rear.&nbsp;</span><span style>He even obtained 850 new farmers... No, he had secured prisoners.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro could be said to have the best achievement in this war, but Grid didn’t know this.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Highness...! Your Highness!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cold desert night.&nbsp;</span><span style>A person of a noble lineage died without leaving a will behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chucksley hugged Prince Ren’s corpse and tears flowed down.&nbsp;</span><span style>Aslan’s expression was benevolent as he looked at Chucksley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sir Chucksley, I am reassured of your loyalty to the royal family. Now, take my hand. Serve me until the day I die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chucksley didn’t have any particular special feelings for Prince Ren. He equally revered all of the royal family.&nbsp;</span><span style>But at this moment, he felt hostile towards Aslan.&nbsp;</span><span style>His cruelty where he didn’t blink when he murdered his brother was rejected by Chucksley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He is scary!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In addition, the value of Chucksley’s existence was decreased.&nbsp;</span><span style>He felt helpless that he couldn’t protect Prince Ren.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chucksley swallowed his fear, anger, and despair as he bowed to Aslan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...I will follow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was his duty.&nbsp;</span><span style>No matter what Aslan was, Chucksley had to follow him since he served the Eternal Kingdom’s royal family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A person blinded by the throne and borrowing the power of a foreign nation to kill his brother, I can’t really be loyal to you.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would just perform his duty.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chucksley’s hot loyalty for the royal family cooled.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Prince Aslan wasn’t aware of his internal thoughts and was happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Today is a happy day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Aslan, who was destined not to be king just because he was born two years later than Prince Ren.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had always cursed his fate.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a prince who couldn’t be king, he hated his rotten life.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now his fate changed thanks to Prince Ren’s stupidity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now, let’s go back. I will take care of my brother who was killed by Duke Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>February 10th, Year 406 of the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>1st Prince Ren started his invasion of Reidan with only an army of 7,000 people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>February 17th, Year 406 of the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>13th King Wiesbaden died and 2nd Prince Aslan became king.</span></p>
 <p><span style>February 21st, Year 406 of the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>14th King Aslan declared at a meeting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duke Grid might’ve killed the prince, but he isn’t guilty. Prince Ren forgot about Duke Grid’s merits and invaded without any justification. He was clearly wrong and Duke Grid only defended himself."</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was able to maintain his position and lead a life that wasn’t any different from before, despite being charged with killing Prince Ren.&nbsp;</span><span style>His position as one of the great lords of the Eternal Kingdom was still solid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But this wasn’t what Lauel desired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In my original plan, Grid’s position should already be beyond the royal family’s.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He intended to take advantage of Prince Ren.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, all his plans were useless after someone killed Prince Ren.&nbsp;</span><span style>The culprit who killed Prince Ren?&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel was convinced that it was King Aslan.&nbsp;</span><span style>But this wasn’t a problem that he could bring to the surface. There was no exact proof and no justification for it. King Aslan was showing favor towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Clever.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>By acting like this, he restrained Grid from growing, while accumulating friendship with Grid. On the other hand, the king teamed up with the empire and could expand his economic and military power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There was an attitude of explicit cooperation with the empire immediately after Aslan was crowned King. This proves that the imperial royal family is behind Aslan. Aslan will be able to lay his foundation thanks to the empire, while the empire can perfectly control the Eternal Kingdom. It’s a good thing for both of them.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aslan, he was a troublesome opponent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rather than frowning, Lauel laughed at the thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kukukuk...! King Aslan, this was good. You’re the first opponent to stimulate my passion. The folds of my brain are twitching with excitement.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel held up a big hand and covered half of his small face.&nbsp;</span><span style>He leaned back on the window and lifted the transparent glass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I can’t wait. The master of the glass filled with bitter tears will be me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>So...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was rejoicing while Lauel was immersed in this atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"King Aslan sent another gift? Hey, he’s a nice guy. Hahaha! He is much better than the former king!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the war.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He acquired a lot of loot and King Aslan sent gold treasures, so Reidan became abundant.&nbsp;</span><span style>This would be the foundation on which all 1,000 of Reidan’s soldiers could arm themselves with the Mass Production Grid Set.&nbsp;</span><span style>The soldiers of Reidan were being reborn as true elites.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was busy making the Mass Production Grid sets with the four God Hands.&nbsp;</span><span style>He went out for a walk and to spend time with Lord, only for his eyes to widen.&nbsp;</span><span style>The cause was the large number of farmers working in the fields. It seemed to have grown by 1,000 people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Where did all these people come from?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reidan was suffering from a population problem, so how were there so many farmers?&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro came over to the grumbling Grid and explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I picked them up by chance in the Altes Mountains.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Picked up people in the mountains? It was also more than 800 people?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a ridiculous explanation.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid believed it because he had a history of bringing the Ul Clan here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There must be an ethnic minority living in the Altes Mountains. Very good. It is no wonder why I didn’t see you during the war.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the moment when soldiers of the Eternal Kingdom were treated as a minority.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royman had a question.&nbsp;</span><span style>She confirmed that Grid was busy with Lord in his arms and asked Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Piaro, why didn’t you tell the duke the truth? They aren't a minority, but people from the Eternal Kingdom like us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don’t want the workforce I obtained to be taken away into the army. This isn’t an act to deceive My Lord. Farming is a national power, so in the end, I made a choice for My Lord. I will also train them to do some military exercises.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royman witnessed Piaro’s overwhelming skills and sincerely admired Piaro. Everything that Piaro said sounded right.&nbsp;</span><span style>Anyway, 850 farmers were added to Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>They worked in the fields in the morning and received military training at night.&nbsp;</span><span style>Mixed among them was Aura Master Hurent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What am I doing now?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very confusing and embarrassing, but he couldn’t help desiring the results of the ‘★ Hidden Quest ★ Fun and Exciting Training.’&nbsp;</span><span style>Reidan was becoming stronger day by day.</span></p>
