 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>After restoring the proper amount of stamina.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid barely managed to sit up on a flat piece of rock.&nbsp;</span><span style>He noticed the eyes of the Overgeared members looking at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The atmosphere has changed.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was it because he overcame this big trial by surpassing his limit several times over?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid felt like he had achieved excellent personal growth.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid shared the item information with the Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Guardian’s Necklace]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Unique (Set)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 23/23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 35</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Indomitable +30</span></p>
 <p><span style>* When the set is worn: Defense +100</span></p>
 <p><span style>* When the set is worn: Indomitable +50</span></p>
 <p><span style>A necklace manifested by the Doppelganger of the Mysterious Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It gives the wearer a strong willpower and defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>User Restriction: Level 300 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 15</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Guardian’s Bracelet]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Unique (Set)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 21/21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 37</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Indomitable +30</span></p>
 <p><span style>* When the set is worn: Defense +100</span></p>
 <p><span style>* When the set is worn: Indomitable +50</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bracelet manifested by the Doppelganger of the Mysterious Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It gives the wearer a strong willpower and defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>User Restriction: Level 300 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 11</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh, it’ a magic accessory?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. Defense is attached to an accessory?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most accessories didn’t have much defense.&nbsp;</span><span style>For example, while Doran’s Ring could exert tremendous healing ability equivalent to a legendary rating, it didn’t give even one point of defense.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, the Guardian’s Necklace and Bracelet both had extremely high defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘With the set effect, they increase defense by 172 points...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was comparable to a level 300 heavy gauntlets or heavy boots of the normal rating.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was amazing that these two accessories gave such high defense.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the members weren’t happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just high defense? They don’t have any options.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. An accessory should at least have some attribute resistance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I need accessories that decrease cooldown time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It raises the indomitable stat, but the stat itself isn’t all that great.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Indomitable]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Has a certain probability of invalidating a portion of the incoming damage. The lower the health, the higher the probability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The higher the number, the higher the effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Stat points can’t be distributed to this stat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to the stated description, Indomitable was a very useful special stat. In particular, it was an essential stat for tankers.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, because the probability of the stat’s effect being activated was extremely low, people treated ‘indomitable’ as a trash stat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was more familiar with this than anyone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The indomitable stat really is trash.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid currently had close to 900 points in Indomitable.&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite this fact, he never experienced the indomitable effect.&nbsp;</span><span style>These were the only accessories that a strong boss monster dropped?&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members were disappointed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Grid was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you guys don’t mind, I would like to use these accessories.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he became Pagma's Descendant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had been self-sufficient regarding items through production and raids.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, accessories weren’t an area that blacksmiths could produce and because boss monsters didn’t often drop them, Grid didn’t have any.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I couldn’t find someone who could handle the purple orichalcum...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>From Grid’s perspective, he was grateful even for the Guardian accessory set.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members unconditionally agreed to Grid’s request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid, you should do what you want.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are the first place in this raid. It is natural for you to have what you want.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid expressed his gratitude and shared the information of the greatsword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Doppelganger’s Greatsword]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Legendary</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 731/731 &nbsp;Attack Power: 780~1,516</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attack Speed: -6%&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Ignores 20% of the enemy’s defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Increases the power of attack skills by 20%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A greatsword that the Doppelganger of the Mysterious Forest copied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It imitated the work of the legendary blacksmith Pagma, but the resemblance is only in the appearance. The power isn’t comparable to Pagma’s works.</span></p>
 <p><span style>User Restriction: Level 320 or higher. More than 2,010 strength. Advanced Sword Mastery level 2 or higher.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 3,955</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is terrific!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was overwhelming performance.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members let out sounds of admiration.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was also impressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is at this level, despite not being comparable to Pagma’s work?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The damage was slightly less than the unique rated Failure, but the options of the greatsword showed other advantages.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, the 20% increase in attack skills damage captivated Grid’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I use this greatsword, Pagma’s Swordsmanship will be greatly strengthened...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, it wasn’t a weapon good enough to replace Failure.&nbsp;</span><span style>It meant it wasn’t suitable for Grid to use.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members were also similar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It is a pity that it’s a greatsword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It would’ve been nice if it was a one-handed weapon...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one used the greatsword as a weapon among the Overgeared members.&nbsp;</span><span style>Beast Master Toon could handle a greatsword, but his primary weapon was a wrist blade.&nbsp;</span><span style>Both Grid and the Overgeared members felt regret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why don’t you try challenging the two sword style?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel suggested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Two sword style? Dual swordsmanship?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some swordsmen classes acquired a passive skill called the ‘Two Sword Style’, where they used two swords instead of a shield and boasted powerful attacks and dazzling attack orbits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He doesn’t have the skill called Two Sword Style... But it shouldn’t be a problem?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Pagma’s Descendant, Grid could handle all weapons regardless of whether he had the required weapon mastery skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members knew this fact.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid thought negatively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How can I do dual swordsmanship with a greatsword...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The weight wasn’t a problem.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s strength stat was unrivaled. Failure was light by default, but he could swing the relatively heavy Doppelganger’s Greatword with one hand.&nbsp;</span><span style>But there was a problem.&nbsp;</span><span style>Both Failure and the Doppelganger’s Greatsword had a length of 2m.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wouldn’t be easy to wield two weapons longer than his height at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel persuaded Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your control skills have increased by leaps and bounds during this raid. It is more than you can imagine yourself. I am confident that if you try hard and don’t give up, I am convinced that you can do it. Besides, don’t you have a great mentor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel pointed towards Piaro and said, </span></p>
 <p><span style>"Toon uses two wrist blades and Piaro is the strongest swordsman. If you study with them, won’t you be able to master the Two Sword Style someday?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Umm...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Certainly, it was a tempting suggestion.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Doppelganger’s Greatsword increased basic damage and skills damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>By taking advantage of the two weapons and using Pagma’s Swordsmanship, he would be able to achieve a much higher attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I want to challenge it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>His blood was boiling.&nbsp;</span><span style>But there was a problem.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Doppelganger’s Greatsword was an item obtained in a raid group with the Overgeared members. He couldn’t take all the items alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid hesitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do as Lauel says.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right. It is a good idea. Grid, can’t you use any weapon without limit? You should take advantage of this advantage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You will raise your defense with the accessories, so it’s ideal if you can increase your attack power.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were generously giving it to me.&nbsp;</span><span style>Were they doing him a favor?&nbsp;</span><span style>The Grid in the past would’ve giggled and accepted it without any conflicts. But now he was different. He had something called a conscience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members encouraged him when he hesitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"In the first place, you are the only one who can use a greatsword. Should we sell it to others for money? Absolutely not. I don’t want a ranker getting their hands on a powerful weapon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right, should we raise a rival with our own hands?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In addition, we owe a lot to Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he became the master of the Overgeared Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid produced the guild members’ items for free.&nbsp;</span><span style>He thought it was something he should do as the guild master.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was always thankful to the Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that favor was returning to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Doppelganger’s Greatsword was worth at least three million gold.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was thrilled by the Overgeared members’ actions.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“It is extremely difficult to adapt to using two swords in a short period of time. In particular, it is theoretically impossible to master dual wielding with greatswords.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you mean I should give up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, that isn’t it. It is possible to overcome it with Pagma’s power. But it will take time. First of all, don’t fret. I will try to train you so that you can use dual swords with Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid and the Overgeared members passed through the Mysterious Forest and climbed the mountain.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was to search for the presence of a mine.&nbsp;</span><span style>While they were moving, Grid discussed how to dual wield with Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi was walking ahead and he shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is a small cabin on the slopes of the mountain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A cabin?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A person lived in a dangerous area where no one could enter because of the doppelganger?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid and the Overgeared members were curious but didn’t forget their boundaries. They knocked on the door of the cabin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is anyone here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no answer. There were also no sounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Should we enter?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner wasn’t sure if there was a landlord present, but he opened the old door.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the smell of mold tormented the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This house has been neglected for at least a decade.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s group started to search the house. However, there was nothing in the house except for a small bed and desk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner discovered an old storage box.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was made of birch and locked like a treasure chest.&nbsp;</span><span style>What was inside?&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner was curious and tried to break the box.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the system rejected it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Nothing happened.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This... It looks like we need a key to open the box?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Leave it to me."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid came forward.&nbsp;</span><span style>He pulled out his ‘Master Key.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Clink.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The rusty lock was opened with no resistance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a small book in the storage box.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid opened it.</span></p>
