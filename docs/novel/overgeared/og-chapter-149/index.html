 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Oppa, come out!</span></i> <i><span style>Quickly!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo received contact from outside and hurriedly emerged from his capsule.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Sehee?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time Sehee prompted him to log out since he had started making money in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>How urgent was the situation for her to do something so unusual?</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Perhaps it’s a robbery?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo had a timid nature.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was four times as affected by horror movies when compared to normal people, and he couldn’t walk alone at night unless he was drunk. He panicked whenever he looked into the eyes of someone who was slightly scary.&nbsp;</span><span style>If a burglar entered his home, he would think about fleeing rather than protecting the house.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Now it’s different.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had lived through all the suffering, and his confident was currently soaring due to his endless successes.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the first place, he would’ve been courageous if it was for his family.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Snap.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo opened the closed door and shouted,&nbsp;</span><span style>“What bastard dares? I will kill anyone who puts their hands on my sister!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would protect Sehee, even if the burglar was armed with a knife!&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Youngwoo stiffened like a stone statue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hello."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo was stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rather than a robber, a familiar beauty was inside his house.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t you really care for your sister?”&nbsp;</span><span style>The beauty said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was sitting facing the flushed Sehee.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee was happy, but she spoke as curtly as possible,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Oppa, what? What did you imagine? Anyway, I’m not involved in this. Can you not advertise yourself as a sis-con?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, Sehee looked at the beauty with a winner’s expression.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘There is no room for you between a brother and sister.’ She seemed to be saying. The beauty smiled at Sehee like she was cute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Youngwoo was stunned and rubbed his eyes several times.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he repeatedly confirmed the beautiful woman who was sitting across from Sehee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why is she in my house?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why was the jewel of South Korea in a shabby place like this?&nbsp;</span><span style>It didn’t seem real.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don’t know why she’s here, but she’s really pretty.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura was wearing a pale yellow jacket over a V neck t-shirt that revealed her collarbone.&nbsp;</span><span style>She had good posture, confident eyes, delicate gestures and clear pronunciation.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her overall impression was that of a noblewoman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Approximately two seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style>That was how long Youngwoo lost his spirit to Yura before shaking it off.&nbsp;</span><span style>He might be deceived by external factors, but his feelings towards Yura weren’t so good.&nbsp;</span><span style>He shook his head and moved towards the sofa. He sat down next to Sehee and faced Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you come to my house? By the way, don’t you know too much about me? Are you a stalker?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura’s eyes narrowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He has changed.’&nbsp;</span><span style>The Shin Youngwoo who she met on the way to the alumni reunion would’ve shrunk back from her. He acted like a sinner and couldn’t even look her properly in the eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now he was different. He was dignified instead of shrinking back, and he gazed straight into her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You look like a completely different person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I hope you mean it in a positive manner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even his manner of speaking was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura smiled and replied,&nbsp;</span><span style>"I like the current you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘She likes it?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura was one of the best beauties on Earth, and was powerful and successful at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Such a great woman said she liked the current him, so he couldn’t help feeling joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The glory of my family... No, no. It isn’t good to be in the heart of such a strange woman.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura had a stalker temperament, so Youngwoo replied to her as coldly as possible.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I don’t want to be in your heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura wasn’t fazed. She looked at Youngwoo’s whole body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have gained weight. It’s really good compared to before. Your basic skeleton is good, so you look nice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was true.&nbsp;</span><span style>In his debt-ridden days, he couldn’t feel the pleasure of eating full meals. He played games all day, skipped meals and didn’t exercise, so he was underweight.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now that he was wealthy, he ate all types of delicious foods.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He enjoyed food like a gourmet, and got the idea that he wanted to live a long life to enjoy his riches. He sometimes jogged with Sehee in the morning, and before he knew it, he reached a normal weight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to his previous appearance, he was now slightly above average?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a huge development.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel like I can depend on you right now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo was embarrassed by Yura’s remark.&nbsp;</span><span style>“What is it? Tell me clearly. You, why did you come to someone else’s house? I don’t like this situation. Quickly cut to the chase.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Well done Oppa!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee was delighted as she watched the two people.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unbelievably, Yura seemed to be one-sidedly following her brother. Meanwhile, her brother was indifferent to Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why was a woman that the world admired so obsessed with her brother, and why was her brother treating Yura like this?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee honestly couldn’t believe it, but she still enjoyed watching her brother’s attitude.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I will prepare some tea.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her brother was trying to dump a woman.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee found this hilarious and smiled as she headed towards the kitchen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Yura finally cut to the chase,&nbsp;</span><span style>“I would like you to participate in the national competition as a representative of South Korea.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was she saying?&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo subtly reacted and Yura explained the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is an unofficial offer from the South Korean government. They want me to set up a national team so that South Korea can achieve a good score in the upcoming national competition that is starting May 1st and will last four days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura was one of the top 5 rankers in Satisfy. She was a global star, so it wasn’t strange that she had a link with the government.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I understand the matter, but why me? Don’t you tend to overestimate me?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I am convinced that you have the first hidden epic class.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second epic class was known to be obtained by Agnus while the third epic class was Katz. Only the first epic class hadn’t been revealed yet.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo was aware that the first epic class was the ‘Duplicator’ Euphemina, but Yura didn’t know this.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo had survived her strongest magic in the past, so she misunderstood and thought he had an epic class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"As you know, South Korea was a powerhouse in games decades ago. In most game competitions, South Korea’s professional gamers and teams won the championship, while the rankers in all RPG games were Korean. But that is just the glory of the past... Koreans aren’t doing well, especially in Satisfy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have read about it before... Koreans don’t have a physical presence?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As it happens, yes. It is a problem facing all Asians in general.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee misunderstood the conversation from the kitchen and came out quietly. She sat on one side so that she wouldn’t interfere with the conversation.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura thanked Sehee for the tea and continued.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The South Korean government wants to regain some of the glory of the past through this national competition. Right now, the gaming industry is competitive. The South Korean government wants to revive our competitive gaming power... In other words, they want to build the image of a country powerful in Satisfy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They want to obtain a good record in the national competition?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, but it’s really hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why? Aren’t you 5th on the unified rankings? One person can participate in three events in the national competition. Isn’t it enough for you to participate in three events and earn three gold medals?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time that the national competition was being held, so only eight countries were participating. Earning three gold medals would be enough to enter the top rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo thought it was simple, but reality wasn’t so clear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are seven people stronger than me in PvP, and boss raid and labyrinth breakthrough aren’t my specialities. The production related competitions are for production classes only, so they are out of the question.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The pet marathon will end up being between drakes, but there is no Korean user who owns a drake, so we have to give up on that. The remaining events are the siege, target processing, sword drawing and treasure hunt. Among them, the only one where I can win a gold medal is target processing. The siege is also my specialty, but it is difficult to obtain a medal because the Korean team is too lacking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo, who had been listening quietly, finally asked a question,&nbsp;</span><span style>"You, don’t you seem useless?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo casually stabbed her in a sore spot.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura eyebrows’ twitched before she started frowning.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo continued without caring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this true? No, why are there seven people stronger than you? Aren’t you 5th on the unified rankings? Shouldn’t there only be four people stronger than you? In addition, you are the Eighth Servant so you should’ve obtained special powers. I thought you were strong enough to be one of Satisfy’s three pillars?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura recovered her cool and explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s true that I’ve obtained the status of Eighth Servant. By sacrificing my divine power stat to God Yatan, I can acquire new dark spells and my combat abilities have risen dramatically. But the world is huge. The rankings aren’t the only measure of strength. In fact, you aren’t a ranker. Given the number of unlisted rankers like you, there are probably at least 10 people stronger than me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hrmm... Who are the people stronger than you right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura listed them without hesitation.&nbsp;</span><span style>"1st ranked Kraugel. 2nd ranked Zibal. 3rd ranked Chris. 7th ranked Agnus. 8th ranked Hurent. 11th ranked Bondre. 15th ranked Hao. That’s it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I know that Agnus has an epic class, but the the 8th, 11th and 15th ranked?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. Their levels are lower than mine. But they are monsters in combat. Although they are unimpressive compared to Kraugel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is Kraugel that great?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have seen him hunting many times and he is beyond common sense. He is a person who draws out the maximum result with minimal movements at all times because his field of view is large and he can accurately calculate things like damage, skill cooldowns, as well as reading the pattern of movements and countering. People call me a genius, but Kraugel has several times more talent for the game.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow... He sounds amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He said so, but Youngwoo was thinking differently.&nbsp;</span><span style>So what if he is excellent at these things?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is nothing in front of the power of items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The truth of RPG games was items.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>As Youngwoo was ridiculing Kraugel, Yura asked him politely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I need your strength as the first epic class. Please participate in the national competition and demonstrate your skills. The government has promised high incentives if you win a medal, so it won’t be bad for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo’s ears pricked as he heard the word ‘incentives’ and he was troubled for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I want to participate... But it will be annoying if it is revealed that I have a legendary class... Ah, perhaps?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo asked Yura, who was waiting for an answer with a serious posture.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Is it possible to participate while hiding my ID?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t. Your identity must be thoroughly proven to enter the competition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was expected. Youngwoo changed the question.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Then what about the pet marathon? Is it possible for inanimate objects to participate?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"... Inanimate objects?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“An inanimate pet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pets were pets. Pets. Animals. In other words, a living creature.&nbsp;</span><span style>But inanimate?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"An inanimate object isn’t a pet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The inanimate objects have an ego. They absolutely obey commands.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inanimate objects with an ego?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it like the golems made by great magicians?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The concept is roughly like that...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Roughly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Anyway, the pet marathon is basically a competition between drakes. They will bite at all the competition until the destination is reached. My pet doesn’t have the concept of stamina, so it can tease other pets and win the marathon. I will win the gold medal. The condition is that I don’t appear before the public.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pretend that my pet is your pet. Don’t worry, I will pilot it. Of course, all benefits that you receive for the gold medal will be mine. Okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...I honestly don’t care about credit. Do you have a pet that is equivalent to a high grade golem with an ego?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you don’t believe me then go home and connect to Satisfy. I will show you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay. I will connect and send you a whisper.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura got up. She told Sehee that the tea was delicious and headed for the front door.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo opened the front door out of courtesy. Then Yura gazed at him and gave him belated news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is something you should know. By now, Bairan Village should be ruined.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Neberius, the Fourth Servant of the Yatan Church, has determined the coordinates of Bairan Village due to the spies he sent. Using Mass Teleport, he has led a large army, including the Fifth Servant Balak, to invade Bairan Village. The Tzedakah Guild is either already wiped out or on the brink of annihilation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura raised a finger and pointed it at Youngwoo’s heart.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Didn’t I say that I wouldn’t kill you when war broke out between the Yatan Church and the Tzedakah Guild? This time I have paid off my debt.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It can’t be.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo checked the time. It had been 40 minutes or so since he logged out from Satisfy. That was two hours within Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you time your visit with the Yatan invasion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. You said you didn’t care about getting caught up in the war. Isn’t this good?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...I’m not sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was annoying. In the first place, his relationship with the Tzedakah Guild didn’t require him to get involved in wars. Youngwoo was a blacksmith of the Tzedakah Guild, not a soldier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’m going now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo stopped Yura before she was about to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The Fourth Servant... Does he have the ability to give God Yatan’s blessing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura shook her head.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Only the First Servant can give God Yatan’s blessing. Why? Do you have a quest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What if I do? Can you help?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s hard. I am the Eighth Servant, but I haven’t met the First Servant. And aren’t you hostile to the Yatan Church in the first place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed... I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura left. Youngwoo immediately returned to his capsule and logged into Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Shit! Kill, the killing doesn’t end!}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Faker’s group, we are facing Neberius. His magic will be sealed when we draw his attention.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{This is Toban. Balak is so strong that I can’t last much longer. Where is the support from Regas and Pon?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{The senior followers are focusing on Pon and Regas. I’m supporting with magic, but it seems hard for them to leave.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was an uproar in the guild chat window.&nbsp;</span><span style>The situation was so dire that few people noticed Grid logging in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Ah... How rotten. Being Jishuka’s protector is very arduous. If only Grid made my armor... Damn.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Vantner.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid smiled widely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can play an active role if you have armor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Certainly, only Vantner’s weapons were good.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t just Vantner. Not surprisingly, many of Satisfy’s rankers were armed with items not suitable for their level due to a lack of top quality items.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was one of the few people who could overcome this scarcity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will deliver the armor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid opened his inventory. Then he pulled out the Legendary Blacksmith’s Hammer and the Wave Armor that was on the verge of completion.&nbsp;</span><span style>The guild had endured the enemy’s ambush far longer than Yura predicted, but he still initiated a quick and deliberate hammering.</span></p>
