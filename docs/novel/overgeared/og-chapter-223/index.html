 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>He helped his parents with the garlic and finished his meal.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Youngwoo connected to his fan cafe and cheered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Finally...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yesterday, the fan cafe had exactly 1,998,411 members, and now it exceeded two million.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was the golem invasion and he became the first user to become a duke, so his popularity had greatly increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m happy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that two million people were showing interest and liking towards him made Youngwoo’s heart overwhelmed.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had been ignored and despised for a long time, so the affection of others was new and he felt happy every day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I wonder what Noe’s fan cafe is like these days.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long absence, Youngwoo accessed Noe’s fan cafe and laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t catch up with his popularity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe's fan cafe had reached 2.75 million members.&nbsp;</span><span style>The speed was rising much faster than Youngwoo’s fan cafes. The difference between the two fan cafes was increasing day by day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past, Youngwoo would be trembling with jealousy, but now he was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>He completely shook off the inferiority complex that was deeply rooted in him and wasn’t easily jealous anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Noe’s rising popularity will increase awareness towards me, since I’m his owner.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo had been watching Lauel for months, so even his thinking ability was improving.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He thought positively and stopped writing bad comments on Noe’s fan cafe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grid doesn’t know about Noe?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the title of the day’s most popular post.&nbsp;</span><span style>What was this nonsense?&nbsp;</span><span style>Noe was his pet. There was nothing he didn’t know about Noe.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the only one who knew about the stupid and simple personality hidden behind Noe’s cute looks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo wondered how this speculative post became the most popular.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: Grid doesn’t know about Noe?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Content: It has been a long time since Noe appeared in Reinhardt, making us cheer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe’s eyes that shine like jewels and the beauty that is enough to overpower our gaze.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he is ‘still’ strong.&nbsp;</span><span style>Noe was able to weaken the suddenly evolved ancient weapon by swallowing it, allowing Grid and the Overgeared Guild to win against the golem army.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now I have a question.&nbsp;</span><span style>Originally, don’t pets change shape and have a stronger presence as they level up?&nbsp;</span><span style>But Noe’s appearance hasn’t changed since the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order words, it means that Noe’s level isn’t much different from the National Competition and Grid isn’t nurturing him properly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Think of it from Grid’s perspective.&nbsp;</span><span style>As the first legendary class, he’s a person with a very busy schedule.&nbsp;</span><span style>If you look at TV right now, his CFs play successively. As a top star, he has little time to play Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid thought the words he read were absurd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nonsense.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The CFs recently being aired were all filmed right after the National Competition. Currently, Grid had completely stopped all broadcasting activities. He was on Satisfy all the time except when eating and sleeping, and was struggling to manage Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the author of the post didn’t know this and was just rattling off nonsense.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo felt frustrated as he read the rest of the post.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that Grid has less time to play Satisfy means less time to raise Noe.&nbsp;</span><span style>So Noe’s level hasn’t changed since the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then I can deduce that Grid has a very poor understanding of ‘top-grade pets.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Typical pets lost their loyalty to their owners and will return to the wild state if they are away from their owners for long periods of time.&nbsp;</span><span style>The owners of these pets usually put them in the inventory when they can’t be with the pet for a long time (e.g. when logged out).</span></p>
 <p><span style>But what about drakes?&nbsp;</span><span style>As a ‘top-grade pet,’ its loyalty isn’t easily lost, even when it has a long period of activity separate from its owner.&nbsp;</span><span style>This is why the owners of drakes can let them freely graze.&nbsp;</span><span style>A drake’s owner often lets it hunt alone to raise their level and don’t keep them in their inventory, even when they are logged out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So let’s point out the problem.&nbsp;</span><span style>Noe is better than a drake.&nbsp;</span><span style>The evidence is that he overwhelmed dozens of drakes alone and called himself the best demonic beast of hell.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, Noe should enjoy more freedom than a drake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Grid had given Noe freedom, then I’m sure his growth would be tremendous.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid lacks understanding of pets and didn’t give freedom to Noe, probably keeping Noe in his inventory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe’s growth became stagnant.&nbsp;</span><span style>This is proof of Grid’s ignorance, and is an insult to the top-grade pets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo realized it as he read the post.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am really lacking understanding about pets.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the case of a common pet, the pet would hunt monsters with its master and the experience would be split between master and pet.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was why Youngwoo didn’t raise Noe’s level.&nbsp;</span><span style>Noe was very powerful even without raising his level, and Youngwoo didn’t want to lose his experience to Noe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘However, a top-grade pet can hunt independently from the owner and grow on their own?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t easily betray their owner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In the future, I should give Noe freedom so that he can grow.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe hadn’t eaten since the golem invasion. Apart from that one time, he was always in his inventory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...It must be frustrating.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo was able to realize Noe’s grievances. He felt sorry towards Noe.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he thanked the author of the post for giving him new knowledge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He went too far.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Youngwoo was also angry.&nbsp;</span><span style>In a community of 2.75 million members, it was too much to call someone ignorant just from mere deduction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I represent the Overgeared Guild.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t ignore it because it was the same as insulting the Overgeared Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo took immediate action.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God Grid isn’t Bald’s comment: Yes, next pet person please ^오^ I am an expert on all classes ~</span></p>
 <p><span style>The author of the post that Youngwoo read was a expert on pets.&nbsp;</span><span style>But in front of the keyboard warrior, he became a ‘person who doesn’t know about pets’ and a ‘non-expert.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nyang! The best demonic beast of hell has emerged!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe was still at level 35, despite destroying the ancient weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it time to eat? Nyang?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eyes filled with expectations looked at Grid, who commanded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From now on, you can move freely in the vicinity of Reidan. You can eat as many monsters as you like, but don’t do anything that will harm humans. In addition, report to me if you see anything suspicious... Finally, fly to me whenever I call, no matter what you are doing. Don’t forget that I am your only master."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Nyong...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe’s eyes became wet.&nbsp;</span><span style>The ‘ㅅ’ shape snout opened with excitement as he asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master is really giving Noe freedom...? Noe can go...? Believe in Noe! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, as long as you follow my rules.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Thank you! Nyang! Master is the best! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little demon wings flapped as Noe circled around Grid before flying high into the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cat...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people of Reidan were stunned as they saw a black cat flying in the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the historic day when Noe, who would be revered as the guardian of the Reidan people, appeared in front of them for the first time.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee and Yerim were stars among the high school population of South Korea.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were in the top 10 nationwide of the mock exams and also beauties, so they were the target of envy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Recently, their popularity had skyrocketed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Before they were just stars of the high schools, but now they were stars of South Korea. Even foreigners recognized them.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the aftermath of the golem invasion of Reinhardt that occurred around a month and a half ago in reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ruby!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sexy Schoolgirl!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two girls who worked with Grid to save the Eternal Kingdom and became the first earls!&nbsp;</span><span style>People were enthusiastic every time they saw them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How did you join the Overgeared Guild?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is God Grid like?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is the secret to playing well while studying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is your ID Sexy Schoolgirl...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee and Yerim had to suffer from a barrage of questions.&nbsp;</span><span style>Various media also visited to request an interview.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were many companies who showed interest in them, causing a flood of CF model requests.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this enough?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It reached the point where it was impossible for Sehee and Yerim to go out without a disguise.&nbsp;</span><span style>After school ended.&nbsp;</span><span style>Before leaving the classroom, the two girls covered their faces as much as possible with masks and scarves. They mixed among the students and barely managed to leave the school.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, the place they went to was a capsule room, not their homes or the library.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had a plan to play Satisfy three times a week and followed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three hours later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Today was so much fun! Right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. I am now fully adapted to the new skills, so it’s fun to play.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee was now level 70 after the golem invasion.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, the Saintess’ Knight Yerim was still level 51 because she couldn’t raise her level during the golem invasion. However, it wasn’t a problem when the two girls played in a party.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Saintess and Saintess’ Knight classes had great synergy.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, Youngwoo made items for them, so it was possible for them to hunt level 100 monsters when they joined forces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>To borrow a phrase from Lauel, they were ‘golden spoons’ who played the game to help Youngwoo after they raised their levels.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really is Ruby and Sexy Schoolgirl.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were university students who followed Sehee and Yerim after they left the capsule room.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had seen through Sehee and Yerim’s disguise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t even 10 p.m. yet, so why are you going home?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let me buy you something delicious. We should become friendly, as we’re both Satisfy users.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The four university students were all confident with their appearances. In fact, they were online shopping mall advertising models and were confident that pure high school girls would fall for them.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Yerim and Sehee weren’t people who only looked at appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee had a hatred for men other than her brother, while Yerim looked at money. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have a lot of money? We only eat expensive things.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yerim gave a dazzling smile and provoked the university students.&nbsp;</span><span style>The university students felt their hearts thump before they shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Tell us what you want! We will buy you anything!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s okay. In fact, someone is already buying us a meal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you talking about Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eyes of the four university students sharply cooled.&nbsp;</span><span style>In fact, they were avid fans of Yura and Jishuka. But they had the scandal with Grid at the National Competition, turning the students into fierce anti-fans of Grid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>They couldn’t tolerate that Grid had already gobbled up the world’s best beauties, Yura and Jishuka, and now he was monopolizing Sehee and Yerim as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That bastard Grid...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, both of you. You shouldn’t hang out with that type of playboy. Throw away that trash guy and come play with us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The university students became agitated after hearing Grid’s name and forcibly grabbed Sehee and Yerim’s wrists.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Remove your hand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A voice filled with anger was heard.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a voice familiar to anyone in South Korea and the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oppa!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Shin Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style>After Sehee and Yerim became famous, Youngwoo was worried about their safety. Therefore, he took on the role of bringing them home every night.&nbsp;</span><span style>Today he came to pick them up, only to become furious as he saw this scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take your hands off them right now. Then I will overlook it this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo held a phone in his hand and pressed 112.&nbsp;</span><span style>But at that time, his phone ran out of battery.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Beep.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It turned off with a loud noise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, this, really...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why was this happening to him?</span></p>
