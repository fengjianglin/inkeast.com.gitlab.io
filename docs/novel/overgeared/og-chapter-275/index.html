 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>19th knight, Fulito.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was dissatisfied with this mission.&nbsp;</span><span style>His high pride meant he was upset at having to follow the orders of a priest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am a knight in the 10s.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He questioned why a such a distinguished person the Red Knights had to do a chore like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is sufficient for the guys in the 20s, tsk.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This disgruntled thought disappeared the moment he witnessed Grid overwhelming Kamiyan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Strong.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was he a duke of the Eternal Kingdom?&nbsp;</span><span style>That person called Grid, his skills were excellent and he was also holding several artifacts that were at the level of a national treasure.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, the performance of the golden spear was phenomenal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A competent person is hiding in a small kingdom.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was true that Kamiyan was inexperienced, but he was still a Red Knight. He was a member of the strongest group.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was honestly surprising that Grid could crush him so easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is approximately the level of the 21st knight. I have to intervene.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The restlessness and boredom in Fulito’s eyes disappeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was finally motivated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let’s take a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lifael’s Spear stabbed continuously at Kamiyan, who suffered a fatal wound.&nbsp;</span><span style>Right before Kamiyan died, Fulito fired a skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the same time, Grid used Fly.&nbsp;</span><span style>Fulito witnessed Grid flying towards him and smiled with satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Did you notice that I am your rival?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fulito wasn’t careless.&nbsp;</span><span style>He pulled out his sword and tried to attack Grid, only to stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless of his will, his consciousness headed to another place. He became completely indifferent to Grid. He didn’t swing his sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why am I doing this?’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Swaeek!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid brushed past the side of the confused Fulito. It was a dreadful speed.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Pant... Pant...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Apostle of Justice’s Partner.&nbsp;</span><span style>Very few people knew about this part of Huroi’s identity.&nbsp;</span><span style>When he was with Grid, all of his stats increased by 20%. He also had many skills that could be used without needing weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he was different from Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t have overwhelming stats like Grid. He was fundamentally an orator, so his combat related stats like strength, stamina and agility were extremely low.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t even have the power of his items.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was impossible for him to confront five Black Knights with his bare hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ugh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi moaned while bleeding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The Black Knights glared angrily at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wicked person! How could you scorn my late grandmother? I will surely kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you talking about my parents?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My colleagues didn’t ask me to pick up soap!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi had already ridiculed them.&nbsp;</span><span style>He debuffed the enemies, but now he reached his limit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The cooldown of Spiteful Tongue had yet to end and his whole body was already wounded. His health had fallen to a dangerous level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Huroi wasn’t worried about his own life right now.&nbsp;</span><span style>He could die a hundred times. Lost experience and items? It was incomparable to his lord’s life.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi just wanted his lord to be safe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“M-My Lord...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>How much frustration was he feeling while fighting against a Red Knight with his bare hands?&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi turned his gaze towards Grid. He thought that Grid would be going through a lot.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die! Die! Die! Puhahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was fine.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was enjoying himself while one-sidedly beating up the Red Knight.&nbsp;</span><span style>The knight’s face was swollen to the point that it was pitiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi felt like an idiot for worrying.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As Huroi’s attention was wandering, a sword flew and deeply pierced his side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are you looking?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuck!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi’s field of view shook.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now he had less than two-tenths of his health left.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he received two or three more attacks then he would die.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi gritted his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I need to bring one of them with me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would relieve the burden on Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi made up his mind and moved with all his strength. He grabbed one of the Black Knights and punched with all his strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>But with his skills and strength, he couldn’t hurt the Black Knight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>His fists falling on the black armor was just like a cotton bat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This weak brat! I don't even feel a tingle!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sneering knight grabbed Huroi’s wrist and raised his arm. Then the area around Huroi’s heart was exposed. Another Black Knight stabbed precisely with his sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>This is normal.</span></i> <i><span style>How can a Black Knight be taken down without a weapon?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Right...</span></i> <i><span style>Grid is abnormal.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi and the viewers took Huroi’s death for granted.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t party with Huroi because of the waste of experience, but he didn’t want Huroi to die.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was anxious about Huroi and used the ‘Secret Hero’ ability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Secret Hero was one of the titles he won while raiding Dark Bus.&nbsp;</span><span style>The condition to acquire this title was to ‘raid’ three named bosses higher in level ‘alone.’&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t a title that just anyone could get, and its value was unmatched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dispersed the consciousness of the enemies.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The aggro was turned off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The skill ‘Influence’ has been activated. This effect will last for 10 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Reduces the defense of all enemies within 50m of you by 50%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The skill ‘Freely Move’ can be used once.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Creates a high level daash skill that avoids all attacks until it reaches the ‘desired target’ that is within 200 meters.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You dare!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid became furious after seeing Huroi and floated in the air. Then he rushed towards the Black Knights.&nbsp;</span><span style>His movement speed was so fast that the camera lost him for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fulito, who was rushing towards Grid, stopped in place. He wasn’t able to focus on Grid due to the effect of his consciousness being dispersed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid ignored him and passed by.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A really strange ability.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fulio clicked his tongue and swung his sword towards the distant Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A strong aura poured out like a flash of light.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s back was fully exposed.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was natural that he would be hit by Fulito’s aura.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid had Freely Move activated. He was able to avoid all attacks except for automatic targeting skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>As if he had eyes in the back of his head, Grid moved his body and avoided Fulito’s attack. Then he broke through four Black Knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Black Knight trying to stab Huroi’s heart was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s movements were phenomenal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Get lost."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeok!</span></i> <i><span style>Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Ugh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The combo of Lifael’s Spear and Unbreakable Justice was used.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Black Knight’s defense was reduced due to Influence, so he suffered great damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid kicked the Black Knight away and grabbed Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Are you still weak? You still have the status of a punching bag.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha... I am weak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, the power of his items was still lacking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s aim for the third advancement class soon. Then I’ll make new items for you. Your biggest problem is that you are lacking items.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will keep that in mind.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Join my party now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It happened when Grid extended a hand to Huroi.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kamiyan regained his posture, rushed over and attacked Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi’s blood soaked Grid’s Hooded Zip Up.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s expression stiffened.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi was worried about Grid even when dying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please... Stay alive. My Lord absolutely can’t collapse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your morale has increased.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your attack power and magic attack power will significantly rise for the next attack.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The next attack will be a critical hit!]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Flop!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi sat down after using the strongest buff skill that he saved for Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kamiyan wielded his sword again, aiming at Huroi who only have a sliver of health left.&nbsp;</span><span style>He saw that Grid cared about Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It went as Kamiyan intended.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid moved to protect Huroi. He took out the Divine Shield after a long time and blocked Kamiyan’s attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You! You are like a turtle!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan laughed at Grid who was protecting his colleague with a shield and swung his sword.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Chaeeeeeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i> <i><span style>Puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid could only face Kamiyan and defend. He couldn’t respond to the Black Knights who were stabbing from the rear. He couldn’t avoid it and protect Huroi at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi didn’t like it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"My Lord, why are you sacrificing yourself for me! Wake up! Fight against the enemies! I don't want to grab at My Lord’s ankles!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You and I, aren’t we friends before the master and subordinate relationship?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Well, I usually treat you more like a subordinate than a friend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would repay Huroi’s honest heart someday.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had promised many times.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk!</span></i> <i><span style>Puuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After that, the injuries on Grid’s body increased as he protected Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Foolish man. Sacrificing yourself to protect your subordinate, you are no match for me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fulito folded his arms.&nbsp;</span><span style>He lost interest in Grid and returned to his bystander’s attitude.&nbsp;</span><span style>Meanwhile, Kamiyan’s onslaught continued.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Without that golden spear, you are nothing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan didn’t give Grid a chance to breathe.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then a notification window flashed in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Patience skill has been activated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Health, defense and dexterity will rise by 200% for one hour.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a skill that couldn’t be used intentionally. It was only triggered when he was showing extreme patience.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had some room to move thanks to its help, while Kamiyan and the Black Knights turned pale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What ridiculous defense!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wouldn’t fall, no matter how much he was injured. Therefore, Kamiyan and the Black Knights looked at Grid like he was a monster.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s armor and shield were so powerful.&nbsp;</span><span style>How long could he endure?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Light Sword!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan used a skill that he developed from Duke Limit.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A sword of aura moved through the air and struck the Divine Shield. It was the overwhelming attack power.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s body was defenseless for a moment, and five Black Knights stabbed at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Slaughterer’s Mask that covered half of Grid’s face was painted a clear red.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was why Grid allowed the attacks of the Black Knights without defending using Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The effect of Evil Spirit’s Bloody Tears is activated. Attack power will increase by 50% for 5 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Now it’s my turn.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid invoked Blacksmith’s Rage and declared towards Kamiyan.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I will kill all of you within five seconds.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dark red light shone from his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kamiyan perceived the danger and triggered Keen Senses.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s fist flew towards him. Kamiyan tried to avoid it, but Lifael’s Spear flew and constricted his behavior.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuheook!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was this damage?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was much more powerful than before.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s fists continuously struck Kamiyan’s face, who was shocked by the previous impact through the red armor.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Black Knights tried to control Grid by attacking him, but it was useless. Lifael’s Spear flew over and protected him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Jjang!</span></i> <i><span style>Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Crash!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Blacksmith's Rage, Evil Spirit’s Bloody Tears and Morale Boost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan was constantly struck for four seconds by Grid’s fists that had the strongest buff skills overlapped, and eventually kneeled down. His remaining health was already low so he couldn’t survive five seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This... Yo...u.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A grey pillar rose into the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>It symbolized Kamiyan’s end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Red Knight was defeated with bare hands!&nbsp;</span><span style>Everyone was shocked. All of South Korea was shaking. The news spread around the world within minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Currently, OGC’s audience rating was 41%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Are you having fun?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>OGC Station.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The director was cheering like it was a jackpot, when a visitor arrived.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her perfect proportions and slender legs captivated everyone’s eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was so beautiful that all other existences faded away. It was none other than Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I came to receive Youngwoo-ssi’s payment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura made a smile that fascinated those of all ages.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her eyes were as cold as ice.</span></p>
