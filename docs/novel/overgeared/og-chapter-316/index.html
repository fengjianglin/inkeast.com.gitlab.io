 <p><span style>Chapter 316</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The 1st National Competition and Reinhardt’s golem invasion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid appeared in public and always used a greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Nevertheless, the public perceived the best user of the greatsword to be Chris, not Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was natural.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid overwhelmed his enemies with skills and items, but his ability with the sword itself wasn’t special. The ability he showed at the time of fighting the Red Knight was merely excellent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Chris’ greatsword technique caused the viewers to feel wonder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re the one who knocked down Zibal? Those skills, show them to me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A greatsword covered in a blue light.&nbsp;</span><span style>It had a considerable weight to it at first glance and felt good in his hand.&nbsp;</span><span style>The speed wasn’t fast.&nbsp;</span><span style>But a considerable pressure was felt from it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the effect of the passive skill, Rule with Might’s Path.&nbsp;</span><span style>All enemies in the path of the charge had their casting speed and agility slightly reduced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He’s scared.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro stood still despite Chris’ rush.&nbsp;</span><span style>The disappointed Chris mistook it for fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is the person who knocked down Zibal?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, his opponent’s level wasn’t low. It was just that his level was higher.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Rule with Might’s Path skill had a greater effect depending on his strength. The effect of having 3,000 strength at level 314 was now being demonstrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris neared Piaro, who was standing like a stone, and wielded his greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There was no superfluous movements in the slash.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a violent explosion of wind and the target was pushed back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Perfect!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris admired.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The size and shape of the greatsword was very suitable, making the time it took to pull back the sword shorter than usual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So far, he had used hundreds of greatswords, but this was the first time he had a greatsword that was perfect for his hands. It seemed to be a greatsword made exactly for him. He felt awe towards the maker, Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Dead?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris was worried that he might’ve killed Piaro with this strike.&nbsp;</span><span style>NPCs had one life. No, it was because they only had one precious life that they were NPCs.&nbsp;</span><span style>He felt a little guilty about taking his life...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris’ gaze had been glued to Grid’s Greatsword. He was confused as he looked towards Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because Piaro was still alive and well.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro clicked his tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Looking away after one hit? Your arrogance has reached the extremes. It’s important to believe in yourself, but that can be a poison.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris couldn’t believe it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There was clearly the sensation of something being hit?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was he mistaken?&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris was feeling confused when he suddenly saw the cut up straw hat at Piaro’s feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ninja...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like most westerners, Chris, a Canadian, had fantasies about ninjas.&nbsp;</span><span style>He knew a little bit about ninjas, and learned that there was a ninja technique where the body was swapped with something else.&nbsp;</span><span style>Once he saw it, he was certain that Piaro was a ninja pretending to be a farmer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘An assassin-type hidden class NPC! No wonder Zibal was killed!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris was nervous.&nbsp;</span><span style>He guessed that now the ninja would throw knives at him, or aim a lightning punch at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I must be prepared!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like other warriors, Chris’ agility was only 200, because he focused his stat points on strength. It was virtually impossible for him to see and respond to the enemy’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I won’t give up!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris got ready to fight back.&nbsp;</span><span style>He could overcome his lack of agility with thorough preparation and prediction.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro felt pleased at the sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Excellent.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>His lord had many outstanding talents. In particular, Regas and Ibellin were amazing. And the man in front of him had their level of talent. It was a more refined talent.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the first time since Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I acknowledge your skills.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro acknowledged Chris.&nbsp;</span><span style>He pulled out a weapon with a serious expression.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gulp!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Chris gulped.&nbsp;</span><span style>Would he pull out a recognizable ninja weapon? Or maybe a whip? A ball and chain?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is it a whip?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris’ head spun quickly.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would take different actions depending on what weapon Piaro pulled out.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the weapon Piaro held completely deviated from Chris’ predictions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hand plow!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro’s weapon was a hand plow. It seemed to have just been used, as it was covered with moist soil.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris failed to conceal his embarrassment as he shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t a hand plow! You’re deceiving me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That isn’t the case.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was there a need for long words?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was better to show it with actions.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro moved.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was truly tremendous speed suitable for a ninja.&nbsp;</span><span style>The distance that Chris decided was ideal was instantly narrow, and the hand plow moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The incensed Chris swung his greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was determined to blow away the hand plow and Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>However.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dok.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"What?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he aimed for Piaro’s chest, the hand plow struck the front of the greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris’ balance collapsed and his upper body leaned forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eyes of the captains watching widened. They couldn’t understand why Chris looked like this.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Chris and Zirkan were different.&nbsp;</span><span style>They determined the situation in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It was what he intended!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Large weapons were much heavier and longer than one-handed weapons. The weight was great and had to be focused in order to exert more destructive power.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris was faithful to the basics, and Piaro aimed for this.&nbsp;</span><span style>He accurately grasped the point where Chris focused the weight of the greatsword and struck it, causing Chris’ center of gravity to shift.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is ridiculous!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t this like the protagonists of the 20th century Hong Kong movies?&nbsp;</span><span style>The hand plow flew towards the stumbling Chris. It was an attack that used the recoil of hitting the greatsword to link the next strike.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris felt a chill and raised his shoulders. The hand plow that should’ve pierced his neck struck his shoulder instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 12,300 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>'What is with this hand plow’s damage...!?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if this was a critical hit, it was an unbelievable amount of damage. Piaro was stronger than a named boss.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris groaned and tilted his body forward.&nbsp;</span><span style>After limiting Piaro’s movements by sticking close to his body, he recovered the greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, the greatsword moved naturally to strike at Piaro’s heart.&nbsp;</span><span style>Based on his hundreds of thousands of combat experience, Chris showed his dignity that threatened the enemy no matter what situation he was in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sowing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A smile appeared on Piaro’s face after he was lightly wounded on the chest. He sprinkled several small seeds at Chris’ feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why were seeds being sowed in a battle?&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris was confused, before suddenly realizing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is a mere trick!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The opponent was a ninja.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ninjas were people who used tricks to deceive the enemy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris glanced away from the seeds that fell at his feet. It was a fatal mistake to ignore this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris tried to swing his greatsword again.&nbsp;</span><span style>The seeds that Piaro sowed had sprouted and clasped tightly around Chris’ ankles and thighs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Plants instantly grew from the seeds that were just sown? In addition, the pressure of the plants was very high.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t something that could be understood with Chris’ common sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was natural.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a legendary skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro who chose the path of a farmer after forsaking a sword saint!&nbsp;</span><span style>The ‘Free Farming’ method that he completed after becoming a farmer was at a level comparable to the legends in history.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, today’s Piaro was much stronger than the one who competed with Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You are the second strongest person I have ever met. You should be proud of your potential.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second?&nbsp;</span><span style>Then who was the first?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is he talking about Zibal...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris’ ego was shattered.&nbsp;</span><span style>The difference between them was just one level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t overcome that level difference, but he believed he was stronger. But he was weaker?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris shouted and aimed his sword at the plants around his lower body. Then an energy blade aimed at Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the Rule with Might Sword that made ranged attacks possible.&nbsp;</span><span style>As the powerful blade was about to penetrate Piaro’s chest, </span></p>
 <p><span style>"Free Farming 4th Style, Plowing the Field.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro pulled out a plow and started digging at the ground. As it struck the ground, the soil rose up and became a barrier that blocked the blade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is ridiculous!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy had started exactly two years and two months ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>He steadily trained with the goal of becoming number one. He was even equipped with the best items.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris thought this person was a ninja who hid as a farmer, but he actually was overwhelmed by a real farmer?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He suffered defeat from farming methods such as sowing, plant growing and plowing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can’t accept it!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris barely managed to restore his mental state.&nbsp;</span><span style>The opponent was someone who beat Zibal.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was naive to think he could win when his level was lower than Zibal’s, but Chris couldn’t tolerate this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaah!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris used Tyrant's Strength which temporarily increased his strength by 20%, tearing apart the plants binding his lower body. It was done with pure strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro saw this and thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am lacking practice.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Free Farming Style 1 ‘Sowing’ and style 2 ‘Rapid Growth.’&nbsp;</span><span style>The durability of the plants grown was weaker than expected. It was proof that Rapid Growth hadn’t reached the right level yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to work harder in the fields.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Piaro vowed this, the energy blades covered Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>The hand plow defended against every strike, then Piaro tried to break Chris’ center of gravity again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘His enlightenment is fast.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro was surprised to see Chris’ skill in recovering his greatsword every time the hand plow collided with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s higher than Kraugel when I first met him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro acknowledged it and started to swing his hand plow. His skill with the farming equipment overwhelmed Chris.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Chris’ momentum didn’t go down. His chest was struck but he didn’t retreat as he shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am above Zibal!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwaaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was like a lion’s roar.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were farmers and users scattered throughout the vast fields.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were amazed and frightened, while the captains of the Giant Guild also blocked their ears.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the power of Chris’ second class, Tyrant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is the time!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no one who would be safe when facing Tyrant’s Growl.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris used the gap caused by Tyrant’s Growl to attack the temporarily confused Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kurururung.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There was an earthquake centered on Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>The only person able to withstand this earthquake was Chris, the one who caused it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris expected Piaro to be swept away by Tyrant’s Advent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris was at a loss after using the skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>He saw Piaro standing on a large number of rice plants growing out of cracks in the collapsing land.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You have messed up the land. You will have more work to do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was strange. It sounded like Piaro was trying to make Chris do something.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris was feeling confused when rice rained down on him.&nbsp;</span><span style>He defended by swinging his greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The durability of Grid’s Greatsword has decreased by 10.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The durability of Grid’s Greatsword has decreased by 11.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hollow rice.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were a weak plant that had no sense of weight. No, this was a concept higher than aura.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris couldn’t endure it, and became a rag along with Grid’s Greatsword.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Repair my greatsword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>20 minutes after saying goodbye, Chris returned. He handed his greatsword to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid frowned as he checked the greatsword, which was cracked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this? Did you meet a dragon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You awful bastard!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris believed that this incident was caused by Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The monster called Piaro was Grid’s subordinate, so he was forced to think this way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is it to let us know who is superior in our relationship?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t believe the rumors.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was rumored to be stupid, but he was actually incredibly scary.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid extended a hand to Chris.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The cost of the repairs. It is 3 gold for every one point of durability.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was 10 times more expensive than the normal repair price.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an unreasonable price, but he couldn’t refuse the transaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This demon... I absolutely can’t make him an enemy!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris handed over 853 gold with trembling hands and returned to the fields.&nbsp;</span><span style>The five leaders of the Giant Guild had to work there.</span></p>
