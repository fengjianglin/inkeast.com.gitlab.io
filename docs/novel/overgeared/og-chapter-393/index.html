 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Dammit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 3rd ranked Chris’ pride was as high as the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was understandable.&nbsp;</span><span style>It would be strange to have low self-esteem when he was top three among two billion users.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris only felt his limits with two people: Kraugel and Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the case of Kraugel, he was overwhelmed by the incredible level up speed and physical abilities, while Grid was a legendary blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I can’t believe I was jerked around by Zibal.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris thought that everyone except for Kraugel and Grid were less than him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Zibal was one level higher than Chris and fought closely with Piaro, but when Chris thought about it objectively, Zibal was a person with high political skills. He was right below Chris.&nbsp;</span><span style>But such a person played with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris’ pride was greatly damaged when Zibal raised doubts at the gathering of the leaders of the seven guilds. It would be difficult to recover unless he showed his strength to Zibal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I want to completely smash Zibal and the Snake Guild.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Giant Guild, led by Chris, was the strongest guild in the past, but not anymore. It fell after being hit hard by the Reinhardt golem invasion. Now it would be fortunate if his guild power could be considered in the top three of the seven guilds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this situation, he couldn’t guarantee an unconditional victory if he clashed with the Snake Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, there was the problem of the other guilds allied with the Snake Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Chris struck at the Snake Guild, the entire Giant Guild might be isolated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Chris had only one choice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to aim for the National Competition.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would meet the seven guilds, including Zibal and Seuron, in the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Trample them.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaduduk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Chris was one of the strongest people in the world, despite being defeated by a farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style>His biggest strength?&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t his level, control or items.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was his unique rated second class, Tyrant.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was Chris’ biggest weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A second class was a great concept.&nbsp;</span><span style>Since a user had two classes, it was hard to list the effects and benefits.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi’s combat power was the worst until he got his second class, Apostle of Justice’s Partner.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t use any weapons apart from a book and because he was an orator, he had to fight with words instead of attack skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past, Huroi could only believe in his mouth every time he experienced a crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok... Heok...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Behen Archipelago, the 31st island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After falling into his days as a level 73 orator, Huroi fell into a desperate crisis.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was surrounded by 13 level 85 monsters, the grey-mane wolves that boasted superb attack power and agility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is an island that recreates my past trials.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi was desperate.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t use a sword without his second class and his overall stats were the worst. He wasn’t sure how to handle this crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How did My Lord overcome such trials?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi once again thought that Grid was great.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'It was worth giving him all my loyalty.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi gained courage from this.&nbsp;</span><span style>As Grid’s right arm, he didn’t want to cause shame. Huroi wanted to overcome this trial.&nbsp;</span><span style>He made fun of the wolves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Your mother is a fox!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mother who gave birth to the wolves was a fox?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an insult.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Awooooo!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bark!</span></i> <i><span style>Bark bark!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The angry wolves started to go crazy, falling into a mental shock from Huroi’s Spiteful Tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Your father has a yellow mane!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You are dogs!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your ancestors were turned into my jerky!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a really low mud fight that made the listeners frown.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was one month to the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chairman Lim Cheolho, who hadn’t been able to monitor the rankings for a while due to his busy schedule, watched the recorded video of when Grid hit the 41st island and laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was he happy about Grid’s growth?&nbsp;</span><span style>No, that wasn’t it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was making steady progress, so this wasn’t anything new.&nbsp;</span><span style>Right now, Lim Cheolho’s attention was on the clone who died in the Blackening state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The clone should’ve been destroyed at the moment of death...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it actually fell to hell due to the Blackening state, becoming an independent entity completely separate from Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It this a bug?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lim Cheolho was the creator of Satisfy, but he didn’t build all the systems alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to minimize errors and create a larger system, Lim Cheolho left Satisfy’s overall operation to the supercomputer, Morpheus.&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite the end of Blackening, Grid’s clone wasn’t pushed out of hell to the human world. Therefore, Lim Cheolho felt doubts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Morpheus explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[It isn’t a bug. Z10B005 isn’t a user. Therefore, he isn’t subject to the rules of Blackening and hell.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hrmm... This situation is very interesting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell started to tremble with the arrival of Grid’s clone.&nbsp;</span><span style>What change would this cause in hell?&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, how could the clone grow now that it was independent from Grid?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lim Cheolho was very excited and was looking forward to it.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[You have entered the 50th island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This is a save point. Would you like to register?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have been registered. When you enter the Behen Archipelago later on, you will start from the 50th island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the 41st island, Grid tasted great adversity. After that, he succeeded in reaching the 50th island in a short amount of time.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it wasn’t a pleasant feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The mobs are over level 360.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The higher the number of the island, the higher the level of the monsters.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the 49th island, the average level of the monsters was 360~370.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was at least 55 levels higher than Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their basic stats were very good and they had good defense, making it hard for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was it possible to go 5 against 1?&nbsp;</span><span style>He fought against level 360 monsters in a 5 against 1 match. It was great enough to make general rankers lose their words.&nbsp;</span><span style>But once again, Grid wasn’t satisfied.&nbsp;</span><span style>The stronger the monsters, the slower his hunting speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s doubtful if I can reach the end of the Behen Archipelago by the time the National Competition arrives.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a month in reality and 90 days in Satisfy time before the National Competition arrived.&nbsp;</span><span style>It might not be possible to reach the 66th island in this period of time if the difficulty kept increasing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In order to increase the speed of hunting, I need Fog Island.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he knew it, Grid had collected 18,851 challenger points.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was enough to purchase the Weapons Mastery skill book and 51 elixirs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘51 elixirs.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was equivalent to 51 levels.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he was able to acquire Weapons Mastery and the elixirs, Grid would be able to hunt the monsters of the Behen Archipelago more easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is also possible to make the ratio of strength and agility 1:1.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This meant he could copy Piaro’s stats distribution.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was convinced that he would surely become stronger if he made the ratio of strength and agility 1:1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I won’t follow anyone else, only Piaro.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Satisfy opened, Piaro was the third strongest person Grid had ever met. The vampire duke Marie Rose and great magician Braham were the other two, so Grid judged that he would become stronger if he copied Piaro’s stats distribution.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huhuhut!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid repaired the items whose durability were severely damaged in the Behen Archipelago and laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was imagining the scene where he would reach Fog Island and be compensated for his hard work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had forgotten.&nbsp;</span><span style>The fact this his wishes didn’t always occur the way he wanted.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[You have entered the 51st island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A mission will be created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[51st Island]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Defeat 10 golden crowns in 20 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First Clear Reward: 1,900 Challenger Points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Golden crowns?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a high level mob that Grid was unfamiliar with.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the same with ‘golden crown.’ It was the first time Grid had even heard the name.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What nuisances will appear this time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike his complaint, Grid’s expression was bright.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid boasted the ultimate attack power, so he was confident in time attack missions.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kkirik.</span></i> <i><span style>Kik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was a small island with rock walls rising in every direction.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was about to deploy Fly to find the monsters called golden crowns when he suddenly stopped.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because he had an unidentified sound coming from a relatively close place.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid pulled out the blue-black Grid’s Greatsword and prepared himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kyak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A monster wearing a golden crown on its head fell from a rock wall.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the same time, it swung a big and heavy club.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid moved the greatsword horizontally and blocked it, before moving forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is dirty.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The power wasn’t a joke. The damage was almost at the level of a skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>It felt like he would lose at least 6,000 health if he was hit with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But it doesn’t matter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had met many strong enemies since becoming Pagma's Descendant. It was enough to make fun of common monsters like these.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid blocked the club and used a skill while narrowing the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was a monster with green, bumpy skin and a golden crown.&nbsp;</span><span style>The blue-black greatsword precisely struck the heart.&nbsp;</span><span style>However.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 1 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s eyes widened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kyaooooh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The golden crown started to counterattack.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeong!</span></i> <i><span style>Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He was puzzled by the unexpected situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>Most players would feel confused if the skill damage they were so proud of didn’t affect the target.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid was surprisingly strong against variables.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’ve been through this once or twice.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjeejeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There was a piercing roar as the greatsword and club collided.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid calmed down while frowning at the echoing sound. He used his developed thinking skills to try and find the blind spot of the golden crowns.</span></p>
