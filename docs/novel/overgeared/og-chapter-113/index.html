 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Approximately 10 minutes later.&nbsp;</span><span style>After hammering a few times while squatting in front of the lava, Grid stood up and cheered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good! It’s complete!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka and Vantner asked from where they were watching on the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Already? What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t possible to know the identity of the item made by Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Who would imagine a small cylindrical object with two wires attached was a key?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Watch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid confidently entered the cave. Then he chose the old wooden box among the two remaining and he placed the wire... No, he inserted the key.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Open!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to making numerous items, Grid’s dexterity was now over 1,600.&nbsp;</span><span style>Considering that Khan was known as the best blacksmith in the north and he had around 600 dexterity, Grid’s dexterity was unique.&nbsp;</span><span style>And the Master Key was an item affected by dexterity.&nbsp;</span><span style>As long as Grid used this key, there was no lock that couldn’t be opened.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Clink!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The rusty padlock on the old wooden box was released with a loud sound. Then a bright purple light came from the open box.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid cheered as he verified what was inside the box.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Braham’s Boots]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 140/150 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 130</span></p>
 <p><span style>Movement Speed: +10%</span></p>
 <p><span style>* 20% reduction in skill cooldown time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The skill ‘Fly’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boots that Great Magician Braham loved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The boots go to just below the knee, but they aren’t inconvenient because they are made of griffon leather.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black iron guards gives off a wonderful appearance and has high defense. The pattern of silver embroidered clouds adds a classic charm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is imbued with Braham’s mysterious magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>User Restriction: Level 240 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 50</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagma’s Swordsmanship was made up of the strongest skill tree. But each skill had a fatal drawback in the long cooldown time. In particular, Kill and Transcend were the two most powerful skills, but their cooldown time was too long. Therefore, they couldn’t be used efficiently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The option of a 20% reduction in skill cooldown time on Braham’s Boots was like a brilliant light for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Furthermore, Fly magic is attached...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t Fly an exclusive skill of a few magicians?</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Fly]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Summons invisible wings of magic power to fly like a bird.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flying speed is proportional to the caster’s magic power. There are no restrictions on height, but be careful about oxygen deficiency.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Mana Cost: 2 per second.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner enthusiastically urged Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Please share the information about the boots with me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner saw that the boots inside the chest clearly had a high value. He wanted to know their performance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka was the same. She didn’t ask directly like Vantner, but her intensely shining eyes expressed her curiosity. She looked very cute trying to restrain herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh... If you are curious about what I have gained...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid shared the item information with a boastful expression.&nbsp;</span><span style>Both people saw it and freaked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok... Fly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Magicians had to have their second advancement to acquire flying magic. A user needed to be at least level 200 to get their second advancement.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, it meant the number of magicians who had learned flying magic at this point could be counted on one hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet anyone who wore these boots could use Fly? It was an extremely rare item!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These shoes are really amazing. I can only admire it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Being able to fly... The options attached are really great. The defense is also excellent, so anyone would covet these boots.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner’s words were sincere.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Can you sell it to me? I have a lot of money. I will buy it for an expensive price. Yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imagine it! The ability to fly freely in the sky!&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a rare opportunity to buy a privilege that only senior magicians could enjoy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner sincerely wanted Braham’s Boots. He was willing to invest a fortune.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In addition, Grid had already tasted the goodness of money.&nbsp;</span><span style>He could clearly feel people’s gazes towards him changing after he drove an expensive car. He received special treatment wherever he went.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was able to realize why people bragged with foreign cars and luxury bags.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Yes, my goal is to be rich.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid no longer wanted to live like a beggar. He would no longer experience the sadness of having no money.&nbsp;</span><span style>He made so much money that he could eat chicken whenever he wanted, and could add two eggs to ramyun if he wanted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there was no need to rush.&nbsp;</span><span style>The debt was already paid and he had a stable income source. He had also bought a car already.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, Grid rejected Vantner’s offer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'm not in a hurry for money... These shoes are very useful for me, so I don’t want to sell it right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner felt regret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk... Then it can’t be helped.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham’s Boots’s had a level limit of 240. Grid was only level 114 so it would take him a while to wear it. But Vantner didn’t say anything else. What could he do if the owner didn’t want to sell it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Maybe he won’t make my item if I irritate him...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid patted the shoulder of the depressed Vantner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry. Mister, I am going to make your armor, right? I’ll make a great item for you. Of course, as long as you give me a good production method.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was confident.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He had already made a unique spear and legendary sword. These words were naturally reassuring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner grinned.&nbsp;</span><span style>"That sounds good. The armor production method we have is special~ So I will believe you. But... Why are you calling me Mister? I am the same age as Pon! If you call Pon by his name, why are you calling me Mister?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>To Grid, Pon looked to be in his late 20’s. On the other hand, Vantner was at least in his 50’s.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner seemed like a madman whenever he insisted that he was the same age as Pon.&nbsp;</span><span style>So as usual, Grid dismissed it and approached the last remaining box.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The most ordinary box...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t too flashy or too old, just a normal box.&nbsp;</span><span style>What was inside it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I shall check it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Destroying the giant monster and finding treasure chests!&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was like a hero in a story. The atmosphere was full of excitement as he shouted. Then he pulled out the master key and inserted it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Clink clink.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid squirming as he wriggled the wire around in the padlock was very unsightly. Jishuka became enraged as she watched him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He really seems like a thief.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she thought about Phoenix Arrow being used to make wires, she became more irate.&nbsp;</span><span style>It happened as Jishuka’s patience was starting to wane.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Clink!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The last box finally opened.&nbsp;</span><span style>What treasure would appear?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gulp!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid, Jishuka and Vantner gulped with anticipation and tension.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then from inside the box, a sharp streak of light struck Grid’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a sudden accident.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka and Vantner couldn’t react. They were forced to watch as a colleague died under their noses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“D-Dead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An untimely blow. The speed was too quick. It struck exactly at the heart, so Grid would be fatally wounded.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka was furious as she confirmed that Grid was thrown back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who dares kill a guild member in front of me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her sharp gaze was fixed on the iron box. Then white smoke emerged from the box.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was someone inside.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner pulled out his twin axes. Then he yelled from next to Jishuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You! You won’t be safe after touching a Tzedakah Guild member! I’ll make you pay for killing Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Vantner’s scream sounded through the cave, Grid jumped up from where he had been lying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why are you treating me as someone who is dead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grid? Yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka and Vantner turned their heads and stared at Grid with surprise.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then they saw an egg floating in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? That egg?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a really strange sight.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid shrugged at both of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’m not sure...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The egg that Grid obtained from the first treasure chest.&nbsp;</span><span style>The shape, color and even weight was perfectly like a normal egg. He threw it into a corner, but it flew over and protected him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It isn’t an ordinary egg.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid recalled the moment when he opened the last box.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>A light flashed as soon as the box open and a sharp blade of magic power aimed at his heart. Grid fully expected to die. But at that moment, the egg suddenly flew over and protected Grid from the attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was fast and moved by itself! It also had excellent durability.&nbsp;</span><span style>This wasn’t a mere egg.&nbsp;</span><span style>The egg was obviously a tremendous unique item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'It isn’t a simple chicken egg but the egg of a mythical creature... Is such a thing possible?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maybe it was a dragon!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The egg is small, but who knows? Is there any law that a dragon egg can’t be small?’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Duguen!</span></i> <i><span style>Duguen!</span></i> <i><span style>Duguen!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Maybe he would be the first one to have a dragon as a pet in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s heart thudded in anticipation and it started to resonate throughout the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the eggshell moved! </span><i><span style>Jjejejeok!</span></i><span style> It cracked open.&nbsp;</span><span style>What type of life would hatch?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid watched with a blank expression. The shell was completely peeled off, but the contents weren’t a living creature.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a lump of metal in liquid form.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yes, the lump was exactly the size of the egg. While mercury was silver, this metal was gold.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was like gold water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Susuk.</span></i> <i><span style>Sususuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was stunned at the lump of gold in front of him. In the meantime, someone’s shadow appeared from the box that was emitting smoke.</span></p>
