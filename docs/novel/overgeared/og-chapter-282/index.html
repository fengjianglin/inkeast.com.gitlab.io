 <hr>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>‘I want to see him.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Expert archer Jishuka.</span></p>
 <p><span>She was doing her duties as ruler of Bairan.&nbsp;</span><span>When developing Bairan, she regularly raided the Guardian of the Forest and distributed the resources generated from the raid.&nbsp;</span><span>It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that Reidan was able to hold on thanks to her efforts.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, Jishuka felt irritated.&nbsp;</span><span>She hadn’t met Grid once in seven months.&nbsp;</span><span>She was dying to see Grid.&nbsp;</span><span>She was regarded as the most beautiful woman in South America and courted by the world’s top 0.1% males, but she was irritated because of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hah.”</span></p>
 <p><span>She sighed and wanted to drop everything so that she could go to Grid’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span>[Your lord ‘Grid’ has summoned you. Would you like to accept the summons?]</span></p>
 <p><span>“Oh my?”</span></p>
 <p><span>The notification window she had been waiting for finally appeared at the right timing.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Do you know that I want to see you right now?’</span></p>
 <p><span>It must be telepathy.&nbsp;</span><span>Jishuka felt like this was fated, and her heart started thumping.&nbsp;</span><span>Her delusions unfolded due to her lack of dating experience.</span></p>
 <p><span>'Asking for a summoning without prior notice...’</span></p>
 <p><span>Did he prepare a surprise event?</span></p>
 <p><span>"Jishuka, I wanted to see you too. I imagined your beautiful appearance every night and struggled."</span></p>
 <p><span>She imagined Grid talking like this with a sexy appearance.&nbsp;</span><span>She smiled widely.&nbsp;</span><span>Jishuka’s blinded eyes looked down at her body. She was shy.&nbsp;</span><span>This was the first time she had liked someone since she was born.&nbsp;</span><span>The problem was that her clothing and attire were unsuited for minors to see.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I will respond to the summons.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Jishuka responded to Grid’s call without worrying about it.&nbsp;</span><span>The sight she first witnessed after being teleported to Grid’s side was a mountain of gold coins.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Did he prepare this for me?’</span></p>
 <p><span>Jishuka’s long eyelashes trembled.&nbsp;</span><span>She was touched by Grid’s event.</span></p>
 <p><span>"This money would be used for our wedding funds.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Jishuka’s face turned red as she imagined it.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Grid, dating should come before marriage.’</span></p>
 <p><span>It wasn’t urgent to get married before they even had a chance to date.&nbsp;</span><span>She might have a crush on Grid, but she wasn’t someone who acted prematurely. &nbsp;</span><span>Jishuka wanted to know more about Grid before she got married.&nbsp;</span><span>What type of man he was during the day and what type of man he was at night…?</span></p>
 <p><span>Then familiar voices broke through her delusions.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hey Jishuka. Hasn’t it been a while?”</span></p>
 <p><span>"Have you become prettier in the meantime? Did you get a boyfriend?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Why does women’s armor become more exposed the higher the level? I am thankful."</span></p>
 <p><span>Pon, Regas, Vantner, Toban, Faker, etc. &nbsp;</span><span>Once she returned her eyes to reality, she was able to see all of the Tzedakah members.</span></p>
 <p><span>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid wasn’t trying to meet her alone?&nbsp;</span><span>The embarrassed Jishuka turned her gaze towards Grid.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid didn’t even look at her. He was busy shoving gold coins into Noe’s mouth.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid shouted,&nbsp;</span><span>"Get the money! Money! This place will explode in 2 minutes and 40 seconds, so make sure you get as much money as you can!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“...This is the reason for summoning us.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The Overgeared members quickly grasped the situation.&nbsp;</span><span>On the other hand, Lauel urged the blank Jishuka.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What are you doing? Go and grab the money.”</span></p>
 <p><span>It was a huge amount of gold coins.&nbsp;</span><span>If they could obtain it, Reidan could overcome its financial burdens.</span></p>
 <p>[62 <span id="footnote-62">gold has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p>[75&nbsp;<span id="footnote-62">gold has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span>“There is a limit to picking it up one by one.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The amount of gold coins a user could take in a single action was limited. The problem was the volume that the hands could contain.</span></p>
 <p><span>"If Euphemina was here, she could move it all at once with Mass Teleport.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“That... Why is she disconnected when this is happening?”</span></p>
 <p><span>"I’ll use a shovel.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"Should I pick it up with my shield?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Oh, that is a good idea?”</span></p>
 <p><span>"Hrmm."</span></p>
 <p><span>Lauel thought for awhile between the grumbling Vantner and Toban before using a skill.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Dragon Claws.”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kururung!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Three stone pillars appeared from the bottom of the warehouse and soon disappeared.&nbsp;</span><span>Lauel confirmed the depths of the pit, then created wind.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Wind Dragon’s Roar.”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The wind poured the gold coins into the pit like a waterfall.&nbsp;</span><span>The gold coins buried in the ground were not guaranteed to be safe from the explosion that would soon occur.&nbsp;</span><span>The other Overgeared members also started utilizing their skills.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Mach Spear!”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kuwaaaang!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Vantner’s sonic spear broke the wall of the warehouse. A passage was opened to the outside.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Charge!"</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kuuong!</span></em> <em><span>Kung!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The combination of Vantner and Toban, standing side by side with their shield, was reminiscent of a bulldozer. They slowly pushed the mountain of gold coins towards the collapsed wall.&nbsp;</span><span>On the other hand, Piaro climbed on top of a mountain with a hand plow and hoe in both hands.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Free Farming.”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Pa pa pa pa pak!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>It was amazing.&nbsp;</span><span>The hoe and hand plow moved at a speed that wasn’t visible, extracting gold coins from the mountain.&nbsp;</span><span>A large amount of gold flew outside the wall and piled up neatly.&nbsp;</span><span>Amosphel, who hadn’t been able to adapt to the mood, no longer stayed still.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Aura Explosion.”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Due to the strong explosion, a hole larger than the one drilled by Pon appeared in the wall.&nbsp;</span><span>Asmophel aimed a large Aura Tornado there and blew a huge amount of gold coins out the wall.&nbsp;</span><span>It was an amazing sight. It seemed like they could carry out most of the gold coins in the warehouse within the time limit.</span></p>
 <p><span>Then what about Grid?</span></p>
 <p><span>“Oh! I will pack all of this!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Both hands squeezed out gold coins into his inventory and Noe’s mouth.&nbsp;</span><span>Piaro suggested that Grid was so blinded by money he couldn’t look around.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This limited field of view is poisonous.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid already knew this.&nbsp;</span><span>But he forgot due to his boiling greed.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid recovered quickly and observed the Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘I can use skills.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid had a late epiphany and let go of Noe.&nbsp;</span><span>Tears appeared in Noe’s large eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Spit spit spit! These shiny things are tasteless! Nyang! Kuuock!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Taste isn’t important. Don’t spit it out and keep eating... You, why are you burping?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Didn’t I say I won’t eat this? Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“No! Don’t chew it and keep it in your mouth! Like a squirrel keeps acorns!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Noe, the best demonic beast of hell.&nbsp;</span><span>When using Soul Ingestion, the size of his mouth could be increased freely. It was obvious that he could constantly inhale the gold coins.&nbsp;</span><span>The confident Grid ordered Noe to obtain the gold coins, then he pulled out Failure.</span></p>
 <p><span>'Grid, how much have your skills increased now?’</span></p>
 <p><span>The attention of the Overgeared members focused on Grid.&nbsp;</span><span>Piaro and Asmophel were also expectant.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid wore the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch and used a skill.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Transcend.”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kuooooh!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>There was an emission of energy and Grid’s black hair fluttered.&nbsp;</span><span>The red light contemplated the gold coins and he carefully swung Failure.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kwaang!</span></em> <em><span>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></em></p>
 <p><em><span>Kurururung!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The mountain of gold coins’ balance collapsed due to the exquisite strike and poured out of the hole in the warehouse previously created by Pon and Asmophel.&nbsp;</span><span>Piaro and the Overgeared members were amazed as they saw the gold coins pouring out like the tide.</span></p>
 <p><span>'Wonderful.'</span></p>
 <p><span>His skills had increased.&nbsp;</span><span>It was proof that Grid hadn’t be relaxing while acting alone for the past few months.&nbsp;</span><span>The ability to break down the balance of things was great, even if he relied on the power of an item.&nbsp;</span><span>As everyone was feeling thrilled, Jishuka pouted and pulled back her bowstring.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Avoid this. Phoenix Arrow!”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kuwaaaaaang!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>It was overwhelming power.&nbsp;</span><span>Half of the mountain of gold coins left in the warehouse caught on fire as they were blown outside.&nbsp;</span><span>A great amount of them couldn’t withstand the high temperatures and melted, but it wasn’t regrettable.&nbsp;</span><span>It was already 10 seconds until the warehouse exploded. If Jishuka hadn’t acted, half of the mountain of gold coins would be lost.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Pant pant... Avoid it!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid winced after almost being hit by the Phoenix Arrow, then he and the other members ran out of the warehouse.&nbsp;</span><span>Immediately afterwards, there was an explosion that shook the earth.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Kuwaaaaaang!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>"Kyaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“What is it this time?”</span></p>
 <p><span>The guests gathered near the collapsed building turned their gaze in the direction of the explosion.&nbsp;</span><span>The first prayer room beyond the waterfall was burning.&nbsp;</span><span>The paladins shouted,&nbsp;</span><span>"It must be the criminal who murdered the elders! Go there now!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Damian quickly called out to them.&nbsp;</span><span>"Wait a minute."</span></p>
 <p><span>“Yes, Goddess' Agent.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Damian might’ve been ignored by the elders, but he gained great support among the members.&nbsp;</span><span>Damian spoke to the paladins who stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span>"You will remain here and investigate. I will go there with Isabel-chan and Grid.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>"I will follow the will of the Goddess' Agent.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Damian was currently one of the highest ranking survivors.&nbsp;</span><span>The paladins immediately opened the path for him.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Damian glanced at Isabel and Grid.&nbsp;</span><span>The Grid in this location was Randy. His shape was gradually becoming strange due to the influence of divine power. He was like Grid, but not.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Follow!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The OGC team moved hastily after Damian’s group.&nbsp;</span><span>OGC Station wanted to find out who killed the elders of the Rebecca Church.&nbsp;</span><span>However, Damian didn’t stand still.&nbsp;</span><span>He exhibited the swordsmanship that he developed training with Piaro and Kraugel. Then he poured our dozens of magic spells. It caused indignation among the viewers, but he didn’t hesitate. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>It was an effort to protect Grid.</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>"It is Pascal’s hidden wealth.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid and the Overgeared members were shoving the scattered gold coins into their inventory.&nbsp;</span><span>Damian’s expression twisted as he saw this.&nbsp;</span><span>He remembered what Pascal had done with these riches and hated it.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Damian, become the pope.”&nbsp;</span><span>Grid spoke with a serious expression.&nbsp;</span><span>He didn’t look as impressive while squatting down and picking up gold coins.&nbsp;</span><span>But to Damian, Grid seemed to shine.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I will surely become the pope, whom you need.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Grid had done everything.&nbsp;</span><span>He saved Isabel and killed Pascal.&nbsp;</span><span>If Damian couldn’t become pope after this, he would have no pride left.&nbsp;</span><span>Grid was reassured by Damian’s resolute eyes and laughed,&nbsp;</span><span>“I believe in you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span>Damian was shaken.&nbsp;</span><span>He was well aware that Grid didn’t help him for pure motivations.&nbsp;</span><span>But Grid still believed in him?&nbsp;</span><span>It was the first time Damian, who was an otaku, was treated like this.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Perhaps... Would you like to join Overgeared?”</span></p>
 <p><span>A pope becoming a guild member?&nbsp;</span><span>It was nice to hear.&nbsp;</span><span>However, Lauel restrained Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The Rebecca Church is supposed to be neutral on the surface.”</span></p>
 <p><span>It was right to maintain the neutrality of the Rebecca Church, who preached their doctrines regardless of species or nationality. &nbsp;</span><span>It was feared that the value of the church would decline if various powers opposed the blatant favoritism.</span></p>
 <p><span>"That's right.”&nbsp;</span><span>Grid was sincerely sorry and held out a hand to Damian.&nbsp;</span><span>"Well, so what if we aren’t in the same guild? It doesn’t change the fact that we are eternal companions. Join the guild after your term as a pope is over.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“...Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span>He got a friend.&nbsp;</span><span>Damian smiled with delight and shook Grid’s hands.</span></p>
