 <p></p>
 <p>"He has a legendary class, yet he’s only level 21? How can he play the game like this? Amazing. His ability to not level up is truly amazing. It’s a wonder that he gained the class quest.”</p>
 <p><span style>Yoon Sangmin didn’t like Shin Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style>Shin Youngwoo’s game history confirmed that he was a young man with no talent at playing the game.&nbsp;</span><span style>Taking the legendary class, wasn’t it like a swine obtaining a pearl? Yoon Sangmin thought it was a waste of a legendary class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He is a person who will never become a ranker in his entire life. Thanks to his interruption, a large amount of content regarding the legendary class is consumed. Now he’s about to consume another large game content...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Director Yoon Sangmin was sure of it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Poison. This person is a deadly poison to Satisfy. Before he does more harm, we have to stop his account forever.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Director Yoon Sangmin didn’t have the authority to manage user accounts. He had no choice but to keep his thoughts to himself.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yoon Sangmin inwardly cursed Shin Youngwoo, then he asked Yoon Nahee with a serious face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"By the way, why does the quest only have a 9% chance of succeeding? There is a 9% chance of this person rescuing Allunbatar? Nonsense. Isn’t it more likely to be a 0% chance?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other executives agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This figure is obviously wrong."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right. I’m sure that the supercomputer Morpheus is infected with a virus.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This quest was a failure. There was no way that a level 21 user could rescue Allunbatar.&nbsp;</span><span style>The aggressive publicity campaign was finished.&nbsp;</span><span style>Everyone thought so and was sad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But in the midst of this, only Lim Cheolho was happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The protagonist of three big events in succession... Since becoming a legendary class, he made epic rated arrows and received the class quest, so I am somehow feeling expectant towards this young man.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>To put it bluntly, it was an incompetence so beyond common sense that it was difficult to predict.&nbsp;</span><span style>Shin Youngwoo was fun to watch because he caused many variables.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lim Cheolho was happy, regardless of the quest results.&nbsp;</span><span style>The other executives, including Park Eunhyuk and Yoon Sangmin, were upset.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>I met Khan earlier than Huroi. I protected Khan’s smithy and paid for his medical treatment. I was a great benefactor to Khan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, who was Huroi? He only spoke a few words to Khan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why did Khan give him the huge ‘For the Residents of Winston’ quest?&nbsp;</span><span style>Meanwhile, I received a quest that would only give me 600 gold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Isn’t it normal to give me all the quests?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Khan was an NPC who knew how to repay favours, he would’ve passed all his quests to me. But he was an ungrateful NPC.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Khan should repay the favor.. No, is he crazy? Anyway, I need to think about the contents of the story. If I want NPCs to listen to me, do I have to act better in the future?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more I thought about it, the worse I felt.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘For the Residents of Winston’ was a massive quest that would control Winston’s fate. It was natural for Khan to give it to the person he trusted most.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But his choice was Huroi!&nbsp;</span><span style>It meant I was worse than someone Khan had never met before!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why is a dog who rolled out from nowhere more credible than me...? Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was at a street stall near my house.&nbsp;</span><span style>I lamented about my life while pouring a shot of bitter shochu into my mouth. (Shochu is a Japanese alcoholic drink.)</span></p>
 <p><span style>My limit was originally one and a half bottles of shochu, but I was so disappointed in Khan and jealous of the jerk that I drank too much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuaaah~!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I emptied my third bottle of shochu.&nbsp;</span><span style>My heart still wasn’t soothed and I felt like crying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more I thought about it, the more hateful Khan was. I truly believed that we had become sincere friends during the time I spent with him, but Khan thought differently. Khan didn’t believe in me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why didn’t he trust me, giving a good quest to that other guy instead? Why...why? Damnnn!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyway, tomorrow it would start raining for three days. I didn’t need to worry about going to work during that time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I called out for the stall owner in a loud voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ajumma.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The middle-aged woman cutting the <a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=soondae&amp;oq=soondae&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.854j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soondae</a> was surprised by my call and flinched.&nbsp;</span><span style>I was able to notice that the woman’s eyes shook slightly as she met my gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'...Is my charm maximized by the lonely aura that I am emitting?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The loneliness in my eyes was like a blizzard on Mount Everest.&nbsp;</span><span style>Looking at those quivering eyes, the middle-aged woman seemed to be confused about being attracted to a young man around her son’s age.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am such a sinful man...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I felt sorry to the middle-aged woman, but I had no interest in her.&nbsp;</span><span style>Especially if the other person was a married woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can’t break apart a family.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I cut to the chase so that the woman wouldn’t have any expectations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One more bottle of shochu. Can I also get a refill of the fish soup? Don’t forget to put a piece of radish in the fish soup as a service...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The middle-aged woman plugged the knives she was holding into the chopping block. Then she pointed at me and shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are really too much! I don’t care about the three bottles of shochu, but I already said that I won’t refill the fish soup after the 9th time! Furthermore, you ask for a service every time! The total value is more than the alcohol you’re drinking. How can a young man have no shame?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...You are very inhospitable. At the very least, you should serve your customers fish soup... This world is once again causing me great disappointment. Yes, just like Khan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you saying? I can’t afford to give you any more free refills!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The owner was stubborn.&nbsp;</span><span style>My plan to fill my stomach with fish soup was in vain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is time to say goodbye and return to cruel reality...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I gave up asking for more refills and stood up. I placed the money for the drinks on the table, said goodbye to the owner and left the stall.&nbsp;</span><span style>As I walked on in a lonely mood, an angry voice was heard from behind me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey, Young Man! You are lacking 1,000 won! Give me 1,000 won!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ah, I counted the money wrongly due to being drunk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Then let’s try.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is a chance to save 1,000 won!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, I never felt like saving money. But now I was debt-ridden, so the spirit of saving was unavoidable.&nbsp;</span><span style>As the number of conservative young people grew, the future of South Korea would become brighter.&nbsp;</span><span style>For the sake of my spirit of saving and Korea’s future, I needed to avoid paying this 1,000 won.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'...No, no matter how drunk I am, I can’t run away. I was caught on security camera and will probably be brought to the police station.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wouldn’t it be shameful to be placed behind bars over 1,000 won?&nbsp;</span><span style>I turned around and handed a 1,000 won bill to the middle-aged woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I was a common person of this modern society, I would’ve run away without paying this 1,000 won. But I returned to pay the 1,000 won. Isn’t it wonderful?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Don’t most people act like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That...you aren’t aware of the world. Do you know how many immoral people there are these days? People like me are rare!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“R-Really? I understand. I understand already, so you should go home. You are drunk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Uhuh! Ajumma! Do you know how bleak my heart is? You should pack some fish soup for a young man who is nice enough to pay the 1,000 won in this chilly weather.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The middle-aged woman returned to her stall without saying anything else.&nbsp;</span><span style>I waited for her to come out again with fish soup, but she didn’t return after 5, then 10 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha... Once again, I have been betrayed. Both NPCs and people betray my faith!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, this was a bitter world.&nbsp;</span><span style>I went back home while realizing that I was alone in this world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“You should contact me if you are returning late! Do you know what time it is now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was one in the morning.&nbsp;</span><span style>As soon as I returned home, I was disturbed by Sehee who was watching TV in the living room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you been drinking until now? Oppa doesn’t have a girlfriend or friends. Then why? Don’t tell me you were drinking alone? Aren’t you embarrassed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Hey, you have school tomorrow, so why aren’t you asleep yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was worried when a person who only spends time at work or in his capsule suddenly disappears... No, it is strange!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh? Are you concerned about me? So you waited up to this time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What? Who was waiting? I-I was just watching a fun TV program and couldn’t go sleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why are you so mad? You face is red as well. What did I do wrong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"W-whose face is red? That is ridiculous. I’m going to sleep now!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee turned and entered her room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Phew, teenage girls are really difficult.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee’s loud voice had broken my drunken haze.&nbsp;</span><span style>I once again became mad about missing out on the ‘For the Residents of Winston’ quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn, I’m going to sleep quickly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Sehee left her room again. She approached me and started nagging.&nbsp;</span><span style>“You should brush your teeth and scrub your feet. You are drunk, so don’t take a shower. Well, I never expected you to take a shower because you’re not the type to shower every day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Aren’t you sleeping?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am going to drink some water before sleeping.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then go and drink water. Good night.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee headed towards the kitchen while I went into the bathroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not a child who needs to brush their teeth more than once a day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In rare cases, I did it three times a day.&nbsp;</span><span style>I stopped trying to place toothpaste on my toothbrush.&nbsp;</span><span style>I drank so much that my eyes kept closing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t die if I don’t brush for a day...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, I just washed my hands and left the bathroom. Then I went straight to my room.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee sounded like she was screaming outside my room, but I didn’t worry about it and went to sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The day was over.</span></p>
