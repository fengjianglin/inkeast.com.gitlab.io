 <p><span style>Chapter 264</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>{Welcome.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{You came!}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Are you rested?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members welcomed Grid when he connected.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid looked at the guild members list and questioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Where and what are Pon and Regas doing?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were connected, but their location was marked as ‘unknown.’ This was the first time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{They have been like that for a fortnight already. I can’t get in touch with them, so it seems like they’re trapped in an unusual dungeon.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Should we organize a search party?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Search party? Grid, are you worried about those two?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{There’s no need to worry about them. Look at their levels. It went up by one in just a fortnight.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{I think they found a huge hunting ground}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{We don’t need to worry about those monsters. It’s a waste of emotions.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Really?’&nbsp;</span><span style>Pon and Regas were level 307. It was two levels higher than Faker. It was a rapid growth, considering there had only been a one level difference between them.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘Where did they discover such a great hunting ground?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>From level 299, the amount of experience needed to gain one level increased exponentially.&nbsp;</span><span style>But they were level 306 and gained one level in just a fortnight...&nbsp;</span><span style>The stunned Grid recovered his mind. Then he delivered the news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{By the way, the Silver Knights Guild will merge into the Overgeared Guild.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{The Silver Knights Guild? What about Peak Sword?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, the members of Overgeared were rapidly raising their level and causing an upheaval in the rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style>The existing rankers dropped at least 5 spots, 20 if it was severe. They were stolen by the Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Peak Sword rose in the rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style>15th on the unified rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was in the absence of the best hunting ground called Reidan. This meant that his level of skill was the same as Pon and Regas.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members were interested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Hey, Peak Sword will become our companion? Isn’t this encouraging?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Peak Sword is the master of drawing a sword. I watched his war video against the Sakura Guild one year ago.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{I also saw that video. Peak Sword was so great at that time. A Sakura Guild member died every time he drew the sword.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Did you see that lump of pride, Yoshimura, run away?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘...Is Peak Sword that great?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid liked Peak Sword. He liked and respected Peak Sword’s personality.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, he didn’t acknowledge Peak Sword’s combat ability.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the time of the Hell Gao raid, Peak Sword had just been a miner and wasn’t helpful in combat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He helped once when I was in danger.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword had grabbed Hell Gao’s attention. Thanks to that, Grod could get one fire stone unharmed.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s it.&nbsp;</span><span style>After that, Peak Sword didn’t play any offensive role.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Well, at that time, Peak Sword was only a second class.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The abilities of a 2nd advancement class couldn’t afford to take on Hell Gao.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Peak Sword would have a third advancement class and be much stronger than he was in the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{But why is the Silver Knights Guild trying to merge with us?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{The Silver Knights Guild rules Cork Island. The scale of their guild is huge and they have tremendous financial power. So why the merger?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid explained to the puzzled Overgeared members.&nbsp;</span><span style>After listening to the story, the Overgeared members recalled what they knew about Peak Sword and were convinced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Ah, that makes sense if it’s Peak Sword.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{It isn’t strange if he builds a religion to Grid.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Lauel, the matter of the guild merger...}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Leave it to me.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was very happy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro, Asmopehl, Rabbit, and the Silver Knights Guild... It was amazing that Grid was constantly rallying the best powers. Grid truly was great.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They seem to like it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guild chat window was in a frenzy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Everyone was excited because the Silver Knights Guild would merge with them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared Guild was in a difficult situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared Guild had too little manpower.&nbsp;</span><span style>They might be the top rankers, but including Grid, there were only 28 people in the guild. It was hard to include two of them(Ruby and Sexy Schoolgirl), as they didn’t play often.&nbsp;</span><span style>In this situation, absorbing the Silver Knights Guild was huge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Piaro and Asmophel approached Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duke Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>A man who respected Grid but didn’t yield to him.&nbsp;</span><span style>He bowed towards Grid. It was the same for Asmophel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Give us an opportunity to serve you."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, the moment had come.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid smiled widely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s my pleasure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sunshine through the window shone on Grid’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a bright and dignified face.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro recalled the day he first met Grid in Kesan Canyon.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had been a dark and depressed young man.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was really ugly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But his potential is excellent.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro never realized that Grid would grow to this point.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The great hall was wide without any decorations, and it reflected Reidan’s financial condition.&nbsp;</span><span style>In short, it was pitiful.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro and Asmophel vowed allegiance to Grid in this place as the Overgeared members watched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid experienced a new system.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have accepted Piaro as a subordinate. The effect of Reidan’s barracks will increase by 30%. The probability of a good harvest will increase by 100%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have accepted Asmophel as a subordinate. The effect of Reidan’s techniques research institute will increase by 30%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have people who are qualified to lead a knights division. Would you like to establish a knights division?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no reason to hesitate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Form a knights division.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Appoint a leader for the knights division that will be created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>-List of people who can be appointed as leader of a knights division-</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Piaro]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro can lead a total of 50 knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro’s knights will have their physical attack power increased by 10%, attack speed by 3% and movement speed by 5%.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The effect is permanent as long as the person belongs to the knights division.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Knights Division’s Passive Skills: Increased Health Regeneration (High), Decreased Stamina Consumption (Medium).</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Asmophel]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asmophel can lead a total of 35 knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asmophel’s knights will have a 5% increase in physical attack power and magic power. Skill cooldown time will be reduced by 8%.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The effect is permanent as long as the person belongs to the knights division.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Knights Division’s Passive Skills: Increased Mana Regeneration (Medium), Decreased Stamina Consumption (Low)</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed that classes that depended on skills were better suited to Asmophel’s knights division.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Huge buffs.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only admiration emerged.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid formed two knights divisions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Piaro and Asmophel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Piaro and Asmophel’s knights divisions have been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Please name the knights division.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“1st Overgeared Knights Division. 2nd Overgeared Knights Division.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait! Wait a minute!"&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel hurried out from where he had been watching nervously.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he trembled as he begged.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Please! Please give it a fantastic name!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Um...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was it too shabby to divide it by one and two?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid felt some remorse after seeing Lauel’s tears.&nbsp;</span><span style>Therefore, Grid renamed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Overgeared Knights Division. Overgeared Magic Knights Division.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was at a loss for words.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t help resenting Grid’s naming sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>But when he thought about it, hadn’t the boat already sailed after the guild was called Overgeared?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Given the name of the guild, Overgeared Knights Division and Overgeared Magic Knights Division wasn’t so bad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It doesn’t feel good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was his taste increasingly becoming like Grid?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was like a nightmare for Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style>A notification window appeared in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Congratulations! You have become the first owner of a knights division!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[’Ruler’s Cloak’ has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bright red cloak. There was the golden insignia of a dragon on the shoulder.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a gorgeous and elegant cloak that caught everyone’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Ruler’s Cloak]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Legendary</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: None</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Skills ‘Charge Command,’ ‘Military Command,’ and ‘Ruler’s Voice’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is a cloak that symbolized the monarch who is qualified to rule over an army.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 33</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Charge Command]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grants the ‘Charge’ skill to your soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the soldiers advance in the direction of the enemies, movement speed and damage will increase by 200%, depending on the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: 5 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nothing will be consumed by the skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Military Command]</span></p>
 <p><span style>You can change the direction of the marching soldiers immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: 3 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nothing will be consumed by the skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Ruler’s Voice (Passive)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>You can deliver a clear voice to soldiers at any location.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘These are skills to be used in a war.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were simple but effective skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>Considering that most of Satisfy’s users were ordinary people who hadn’t commanded an army before, the value of this item was astronomical.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was in the army, so he could recognize the value of the cloak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Sure and swift commands will make an army stronger. Unfortunately...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were no separate features.&nbsp;</span><span style>It would’ve been better if it had the option of raising defense, resistance or stats.&nbsp;</span><span style>He used the Legendary Blacksmith’s Appraisal skill, but there were no hidden functions.&nbsp;</span><span style>Maybe if he used the Legendary Blacksmith’s Disassembly skill?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Maybe there is something.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wasn’t perfect yet. It was still only Pagma's Descendant. It was difficult to see himself as a true legend.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he mastered the skills of a legendary blacksmith or completed a quest...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘At that time, my current self will be no comparison. Maybe I will learn modification skills.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he wanted that day to come, he should play the game harder.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid made up his mind and put the Ruler’s Cloak in his inventory. Then he spoke to those who were gathered in the great hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Each of you should join the knights division and then continue with your missions. Lauel should coordinate with Rabbit to give Piaro and Asmophel separate areas. Ah, and please handle the guild merger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will take care of it.</span> <span style>Believe in me,’ he wanted to answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he somehow wasn’t feeling motivated today.&nbsp;</span><span style>It might be due to the ‘Overgeared Magic Knights Division’ floating in his status window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sob sob.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel could only cry.&nbsp;</span><span style>At that time, Grid approached Piaro and asked an absurd question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Piaro, can I join your knights division?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted the buff.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unfortunately, the lord couldn’t join the knights division.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...That isn’t possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wanted to cry like Lauel.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Grid left the rest in Lauel’s hands.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi joined him as he left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will accompany you, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The red drake was waiting for Grid in the garden.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi was to be Grid’s driver. They were ready to go to the Vatican.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'In any case, this is great.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi was the colleague who followed Grid before anyone else, so he was a special existence for Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid got on the drake with a willing heart and confirmed Huroi’s level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘290.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ssik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There was a meaningful smile on his face.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi couldn’t help feeling curious as he saw it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is he thinking about?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid asked the puzzled Huroi.&nbsp;</span><span style>“You heard about what happened between me and Damian?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, I was impressed after hearing that you raided Pope Drevigo alone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Rebecca people know me well. Right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Of course. They all praise My Lord. Just...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was one point.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian was fighting the other candidates to become pope.&nbsp;</span><span style>Maybe those candidates would be hostile to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Saving Isabel meant being Damian’s guardian.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi got an eerie feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Perhaps?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pope candidates who were hostile to Lord Grid...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why aren’t you starting? Aren’t we going to the Vatican?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was certain.&nbsp;</span><span style>His lord was ready to provoke a bloodbath in the Vatican.</span></p>
