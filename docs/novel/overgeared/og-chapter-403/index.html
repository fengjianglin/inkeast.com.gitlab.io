 <p></p>
 <p><span style> [It’s possible for a great demon.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagma was a great demon?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was ridiculous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Wait.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid attempted to deny it when he suddenly stopped.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t know enough about Pagma to judge, and Braham’s nature was also odd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In fact, isn’t Braham a vampire, rather than a human?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A legendary great magician was a demonkin, so it wouldn’t be strange if a legendary blacksmith was also one.&nbsp;</span><span style>But why?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why isn’t it mentioned in the legends?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham sensed Grid’s confusion and laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Aren’t you an idiot, to take my words at face value?]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I have taken the intelligence elixirs, so why are you still seeing me as an idiot? No, what does that mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[To put it more accurately, Pagma is a human who accepted the power of a great demon.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He accepted the power of a great demon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Baal.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was startled.&nbsp;</span><span style>Did he know the weight of the name Baal?&nbsp;</span><span style>No.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because Grid felt Braham’s anger.&nbsp;</span><span style>The anger was deeply imprinted in Braham’s soul like an abyss and it slowly boiled up.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid held Braham’s soul, so he was also angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Pagma was Baal’s contractor.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was once again surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style>Questions filled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is Baal’s contractor?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[...Hah.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the first time Grid discovered that souls could also sigh.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The 1st great demon, Baal.&nbsp;</span><span style>As the peak of the 33 demons, he reigned as the master of hell.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was easy to call him the demon king.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was an absolute existence that even the dragons guarded against.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[He is more faithful to his instincts as a demon than anyone else. He is proud, destructive, and does anything for pleasure. Plantings seeds of chaos through contracts with humans is very entertaining for him.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why did Pagma sign with such a bad demon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Ironically, he had to borrow Baal’s strength to protect the Behen Archipelago.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The words were confusing.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pagma wanted to protect the Behen Archipelago from the great demons, so he borrowed the power of a great demon?</span></p>
 <p><span style>[It’s as you said. Baal likes taunting and deception.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"So?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>[It is irrelevant to Baal whether the target being deceived is a human or a great demon like himself.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Grid in the past would’ve been frustrated without understanding to the end.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now it was different. He properly interpreted Braham’s remark using his developed thinking ability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Baal wanted to enjoy the entertainment of protecting the invasion of great demons with the power of a great demon, so he signed a contract with Pagma?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[That’s right.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, Baal screwed over his own people.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid couldn’t understand Baal.&nbsp;</span><span style>Braham laughed at his confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Don’t look at great demons with the prejudice. Don’t humans also betray and hurt their own people?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But isn’t Baal the master of hell? Isn’t he the king of the great demons? A king sacrificing his servants just for entertainment... I guess there are some.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he thought about it, there were many crazy people in the world.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was convinced and defined Baal as a psychopath great demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Um... Yes, this is why the Behen Archipelago changed in this way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If so, there was another question.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why did Pagma leave the Behen Archipelago in this state?&nbsp;</span><span style>He protected the Behen Archipelago with a contract with a great demon, and then the Behen Archipelago eventually deteriorated and the original function was lost.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Pagma truly wanted to protect the Behen Archipelago, he would’ve returned it to its original state after the great demons were repelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he didn’t...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Was there a chance that the great demons would invade again?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Or maybe Pagma had no more power left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened after Pagma contracted with a great demon to protect the Behen Archipelago? Did he die? Or is he still alive?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Why do you think he is still alive?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He contracted with a great demon, so wouldn’t his lifespan increase?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[That’s a ridiculous notion. The reason why demons contract with humans is to basically take their life force and soul.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t something strange? Pagma lived for a long time, right? Didn’t you say that he lived for hundreds of years? Wasn’t it because of his contract with the great demon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You are mistaken. Pagma made the contract with Baal 100 years ago, not 300 years.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid belatedly recalled that Sticks mentioned the Behen Archipelago being fine 200 years ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then a new question arose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Does that mean that Pagma can live for hundreds of years, regardless of the contract with a great demon?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was Pagma’s identity?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can a human live that long?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[...]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The silent Braham didn’t answer, anger filling him again.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s spine became soaked with cold sweat before Braham finally broke the silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The reason why Pagma could live for hundreds of years, despite being a human, was because my lifespan was taken.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His words didn’t make sense.&nbsp;</span><span style>Obviously, Braham was a vampire.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unlike humans, they had a life expectancy close to infinity so there might be a way to transfer his lifespan to someone. It wasn’t strange for a non-human and legendary great magician to do something that was beyond common sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Braham said that his lifespan was ‘taken.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does that mean you didn’t give it willingly? Weren’t you and Pagma close friends?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[What if I was deceived and betrayed?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted to hear more of the story.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was curious, but Braham didn’t want to talk about it anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Well, if you want to know more about Pagma, reach the last island. Move to the 61st island. Then after experiencing the difference between your skills and Pagma’s, see if you can challenge it again.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>What on earth was on the islands in the 60s that Braham was so sure he couldn’t overcome?&nbsp;</span><span style>Braham spoke to the troubled Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[It is your duty to break through this place, so don’t think about giving up.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t give up, even if you hadn’t said this. I’m just a little worried about how dangerous it can be.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[What do you have to fear with an immortal body? As I said repeatedly, challenge it once.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as Braham said.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Behen Archipelago was deeply related to Pagma, and there was a high possibility that a quest related to Pagma’s Descendant was hidden here.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid felt a need to investigate the islands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid moved towards the gate of the 61st island with determination.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Sticks, who had been watching silently, urgently called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Braham is a demonkin. You must not be misled by him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I know that elves and demonkin have a bad relationship. But shouldn’t you cool your head? Aren’t you the one who is the most desperate for the Behen Archipelago to be purified? I can also get rewards, so I have to move forward.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wasn’t someone who would be dazzled by Braham’s existence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The enlightened Sticks followed behind Grid.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[You have entered the 61st island.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>An island covered with fire.&nbsp;</span><span style>The lush forest was burning and the river running through it was an ominous red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The temperature is very high.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You are affected by the heat.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Health and stamina are being continuously consumed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The legendary passive is a scam.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy fully implemented the five senses.&nbsp;</span><span style>Users naturally felt the heat and cold, causing climate to be a disaster to them sometimes.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid didn’t feel it due to being Pagma’s Descendant. He was able to maintain a proper body temperature and play the game in a much more pleasant environment than others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pant pant...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike Grid’s refreshed face, Sticks standing behind him was sweating like a dog.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wouldn’t be strange if he collapsed immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you’re a sage, shouldn’t you have a countermeasure for the heat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are a few ways, but I don’t have the materials...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Can’t you use magic?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s hard to use mana because of my illness...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Please don’t die.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid desired Sticks as a tutor for Lord, so he prayed while moving forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There are no monsters or missions.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shape itself seemed different from the other islands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid crossed the blazing island, looking to the left and right.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>His attitude was more cautious than ever.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was extremely concentrated as he prepared for any sudden attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, it was meaningless in front of an strong enemy that couldn’t be defended against.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Step, step.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The footsteps moving through the forest sounded relaxed and proud.&nbsp;</span><span style>The owner of the footsteps didn’t seem to care at all that Grid discovered his position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Who?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid turned his gaze in the direction of the footsteps.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t see anything because of the smoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The smoke has thickened?’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Step, step.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The footsteps were getting closer.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid urgently pulled out his weapon and was surprised when he used Magic Detection (Enhanced) Lv. 2.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[No life has been detected.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no life detected despite the footsteps?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was baffled, but he wielded Iyarugt in the direction the footsteps came from.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the smoke. No, it was darker than mere smoke and he couldn’t properly see the target.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 50,040 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keook...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The enemy had moved?&nbsp;</span><span style>The attack was supposed to be in front of him, but it turned in a flash and struck his back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s eyes widened as he lost more than two-thirds of his health with one blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[That’s right. It’s Lantier.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham penetrated the identity of the enemy hidden in the smoke.</span></p>
