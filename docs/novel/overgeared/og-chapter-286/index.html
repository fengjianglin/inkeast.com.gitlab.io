 <p><span style>Chapter 286</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The announcement of the merger between the Silver Knights Guild and Overgeared was an issue that would cover a whole page of newspapers in various countries.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the merger ceremony was small. Not one reporter was invited.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was no reason to help other forces by publicizing the growth of Overgeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t yet time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Puhahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kukuku!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A banquet was held after the merger.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was intended to promote unity with the existing members of Overgeared and the new members from the Silver Knights Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>The atmosphere was good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Vantner! It’s an honor to be your colleague! I have admired you for a long time! You are the reason why I became a strength type guardian knight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh, you’re completely ruined. You’re still level 180, so I recommend you delete your character and raise a new one. Or else you will have to live with this bad build for the rest of your life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Faker, I heard about how you smashed one of the seven guilds, the Ice Flower Guild, alone, and I trembled. How should I develop my stats and skills to be a great assassin like you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mister? Mister Faker? Why aren’t you saying anything? Mister?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Regas! I heard that you really like Taekwondo and South Korea? The South Koreans thank you! Then have you tried kimchi? Huh? Do you know kimchi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both guilds were a bit unconventional. It seemed like more time was needed to become closer.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was busy observing the faces of the guild members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Do you know kimchi…? That person is similar to Peak Sword. The Korean Patriotic Association? Huh, that person looks fairly young, but he’s quite reticent? I should watch closely because I’m a blacksmith.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 225 new colleagues were future friends and family members.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid made an effort to remember their IDs, faces and features.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, it wasn't that easy.&nbsp;</span><span style>How easy was it to remember 225 names and faces?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Ouch, my head hurts.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Grid’s brain was overloaded less than an hour later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past, his brain would’ve been paralyzed in five minutes, so this was a great improvement.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka, Lauel and Peak Sword were engaged in a conversation next to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The average level of the Silver Knights Guild is 220? At this level, they can’t exert any strength against the desert monsters, so it is urgent to raise their level. Let’s have the Overgeared members take turns to help them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. Improving the working environment of the yellow mithril mine is the top priority. The low level members should be sent to Cork Island and Bairan to make them grow, while the higher levelled guild members should devote their efforts to fighting monsters near the mine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then wouldn’t the low level guild members fall too far behind?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. For the lower levels, the environment of Bairan and Cork Island is much better than Reidan for hunting. In the first place, I have negative feelings towards power levelling. What will happen when they borrow the power of others to level up? It’s obvious that they will be unable to exert the appropriate skills for their level."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right. I was too short-sighted."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The key is who we should appoint to Bairan and Cork Island? A good lord will develop both the territory and the low level guild members well. It might be better for Peak Sword to be kept as the lord of Cork Island. How about it? Peak Sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That isn’t possible. Grid told me to go and mine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword was a swordsman.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was ranked 15th on the unified rankings, and it was evaluated that he should be on the same level as Pon and Regas.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was someone who could compete with the top rankers.&nbsp;</span><span style>That type of person was being used as a miner?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is Grid thinking? Is there a story I don’t know?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Lauel was feeling confused, a boy rushed into the banquet hall.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the minerals detector, Minor.&nbsp;</span><span style>The boy ran over to where Grid was sitting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pant pant... Hey, Duke. Shouldn’t you move quickly to obtain the pavranium?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you in such a hurry? Did something happen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The pavranium sealed in the vampire cities are beginning to be eroded by a strange energy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Minor was arrogant and had no loyalty to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he was surprisingly faithful to his duties.&nbsp;</span><span style>Today he had gone to look at the state of the pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Strange energy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was he talking about?&nbsp;</span><span style>A quest window appeared in front of the frowning Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A new quest has been created!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Vampire City!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Difficulty: ?</span></p>
 <p><span style>An incident has happened in the vampire cities that is the center of chaos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The enormous power has spread its presence throughout the 15 vampire cities, blessing the vampires while harming the pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If you can’t secure the pavranium quickly, this presence will erode and alter the pavranium, making it lose its extraordinary function and turning it into an ordinary mineral.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Head to the vampire cities right now to secure the pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Every vampire city has one piece of pavranium sealed inside it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Obtain as much pavranium as possible within 90 days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The pavranium that can’t be secured within 90 days will be permanently destroyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* It is highly likely for there to be hidden quests linked along the way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The degree of difficulty is a question mark '?’’&nbsp;</span><span style>A question mark!&nbsp;</span><span style>In Satisfy, this often referred to matters that were ‘impossible to measure.’&nbsp;</span><span style>This meant that the difficulty of this quest was likely to be the highest difficulty that exceeded the SS-grade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is bad.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A chill went down Grid’s spine.&nbsp;</span><span style>He knew about the vampire cities thanks to Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to clear one city, wasn’t at least 10 third advancement classes required?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The estimated time to clear one city is 10 days.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was huge enough that it couldn’t be compared with normal dungeons, and the level of the monsters was also high.&nbsp;</span><span style>In any case, this was the conclusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Isn’t this a quest that is impossible to clear by myself?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, what was this dirty thing!&nbsp;</span><span style>Pavranium could be considered the inherent weapon of Pagma’s Descendant and was limited to exactly 28 pieces.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t help cursing at the possibility of losing 15 of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh... Dammit, really. Things were going too well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He once again realized there was nothing free in this world.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka and Lauel became worried after seeing hearing sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it Grid? What type of quest did you get?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you share the quest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a moment.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka and Lauel frowned after confirming the contents of the quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t this a quest that can’t be cleared?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon and Regas had failed to clear even one vampire city. This was despite the fact that they invested one whole month.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had to clear 15 cities in 90 days alone?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was impossible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But it’s a quest that must be cleared. Losing the pavranium is like weakening Grid. It can’t happen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about the guild members help you out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That would be good. However, our guild now has to manage three territories. The number of people who can support Grid is around 10.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina wasn’t at the merger ceremony because she was on a separate mission. Ruby and Sexy Schoolgirl weren’t even level 120 yet, so they were out of the question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“10 of them... Even if it isn’t 15, we can at least obtain 9 pieces of pavranium.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, it is possible."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s face wasn’t good as he looked at the two people discussing the matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop it. I don’t want to bother the guild members because of my personal quest.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the right mindset.&nbsp;</span><span style>A guild master using members for individual quests was harmful behavior that should be avoided.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel smiled at him and explained,&nbsp;</span><span style>“A lot of experience can be gained from the vampire cities, as well as a low probability of obtaining elixirs. The guild members can develop by helping you with your quest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a group of Overgeared members gathered near the hesitant Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I haven’t been hunting in a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let’s gain some levels.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members were hoping to become the strongest rankers. They didn’t want to miss an opportunity to raise their level at the best hunting grounds.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, Vantner was extremely active.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I need some stamina elixirs. Please take me with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whatever their reasons, they were still trying to help him.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was different compared to the days when Grid couldn’t depend on anyone, so he couldn’t help forming some happy tears.&nbsp;</span><span style>A wide smile spread on Grid’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Thank you. The next time you come to Korea, I will buy you kanjajang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The golem invasion of Reinhardt.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had rejected going to the king’s banquet because he wanted to eat kanjajang.&nbsp;</span><span style>Through this remark, he convinced the Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Kanjajang... It must be an incredibly precious food.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is it the food for the Korean royalty?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>How expensive was it?&nbsp;</span><span style>As the Overgeared members were engrossed in this vain delusion, Peak Sword watched quietly and mourned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I like jjampong.” (Jjampong=like a spicy seafood noodle soup. It is common in Korea to ask if you like jajangmyeon or jjampong more)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that they were colleagues, Peak Sword was thinking about helping Grid.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The expedition was organized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid, Jishuka, Pon, Regas, Peak Sword and Faker were the damage dealers, while Vantner was the tanker. Huroi came to buff while Zednos was the support in the rear.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had 90 days to clear 15 dungeons, so the combination was important.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a combination aimed at quickly reaching the boss by piercing through the mobs.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel couldn’t leave as temporary lord, so he wasn’t part of this expedition.&nbsp;</span><span style>Before the expedition departed, Lauel warned them again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"As you all know, the balance of the cooperation is important. There is a probability of surprise attacks, so always keep an eye on your surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I understand, I understand. Are you our mother? How many times do you have to repeat the same thing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner whined, but Lauel continued speaking without paying attention to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Considering that the entrance if blocked and communication cut off once you enter the city, there is a 99% chance that summoning your knights won’t work. Please don’t face a desperate situation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wouldn’t be so uneasy if Piaro and Asmophel were included in this expedition.&nbsp;</span><span style>But unlike users, NPCs had only one life. They couldn’t be risked.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid laughed at the worried Lauel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid pledged to complete Lifael’s Spear through this expedition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I can reclaim all 15 pieces of pavranium, I can make a Lifael’s Spear that is purely composed of pavranium.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a weapon that could easily overcome Failure.&nbsp;</span><span style>His heart was already thumping as he imagined the weapon flying around alone and helping him out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let's depart."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The strongest party in Satisfy’s history, led by Grid, embarked on their journey.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a person following them.</span></p>
