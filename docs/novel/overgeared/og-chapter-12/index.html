 <p><span style>Chapter 12</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>If not now, I didn’t know when I would be able to join a Guardian of the Forest raid party in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Please let me join the party.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I would join the party, survive until the Guardian of the Forest died and pick up all the blue orichalcum that dropped. It didn’t matter if the other party members died.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Anyway, my experience can’t drop if I die!’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>If I were really unlucky, then I might drop Mamon’s Greatsword or Mengel's Plate Armor, which made up my entire fortune. But if I took the risk, I might be able to obtain blue orichalcum.&nbsp;</span><span style>I expressed my strong emotions when I gazed at Toban.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was I too brazen? Did I have any sense of shame?&nbsp;</span><span style>I looked up to see Toban looking at me with a perplexed expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is your level?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What? Didn’t you say that level and class doesn’t matter?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I did say that at first, but... unexpected party members arrived, so I am now looking for those who are over level 120, preferably those with divine magic or magician professions. As you may know, the Guardian of the Forest is a monster whose body is made of minerals, so physical attacks won’t work on it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban stared at my greatsword with an unconvinced look, a gaze that strongly conveyed that he didn’t want to accept me into the party.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Then this guy shouldn’t have said that he would take any level or class.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Should I give up?&nbsp;</span><span style>No, I couldn’t give up when thinking about the blue orichalcum. I would join the party no matter what.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please accept me. I won’t hold you back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is your level?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was currently level -3, but due to Mamon’s Greatsword and Mengel's Plate Armor, my actual combat ability was above level 30. If I confessed that I was level 30... I would be kicked out straight away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“30... no, minus... no, plus 100.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“30 minus, plus 100?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No ~ no. Just 100.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was currently level -3, but I would’ve been close to level 100 if it weren’t for Ashur’s quest. Let’s try it once.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>When I actually entered the party, I didn’t intend to fight. Instead, I would follow like I was a dead mouse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I’m careful, they won’t notice that I deceived them about my level.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban had a worried expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your weapon is a greatsword? Isn’t it around level 65? Even if your item has an epic rating, claiming to be level 100... Are you really level 100?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course I am. My Mamon’s Greatsword has been strengthened to +5, so I can still use it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My face was still.&nbsp;</span><span style>I was just bluffing.&nbsp;</span><span style>I exploited the fact that items enhanced below +5 wouldn’t have a change in appearance, so I lied that the +0 Mamon’s Greatsword was actually +5.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Toban wasn’t easy to pass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Even if Mamon’s Greatsword is +5, to still use it at level 100 is... In addition, your armor isn’t as good as the equipment that level 100 users can wear. Besides, where are your boots, gauntlets, and accessories?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was accurate.&nbsp;</span><span style>Mengel's Plate Armor, which I was currently wearing, was only level 60.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>My helmet, boots, gauntlets, and accessories were all lost by the end of the three months quest...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Items that are like my blood...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the case of the boots and gauntlets, they were destroyed because I didn’t manage the durability. I managed the durability of my helmet and accessories, but it was unfortunate that I dropped them when I died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As I recalled the hellish past, Toban looked at me suspiciously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I said, “The only people who don’t need armor and accessories are those with excellent control over their weapons, like me. In fact, I remove this armor whenever I hunt. I only arm myself with the greatsword on hunts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Control was a word that didn’t apply to me, as I drank potions like I drank water whenever I hunted.&nbsp;</span><span style>When I watched the hunters on TV, I saw them exquisitely take advantage of the monsters’ gaps, firing off powerful skills as they avoided the attacks of monsters.&nbsp;</span><span style>Meanwhile, I just took random potshots and drank potions whenever my health was low. That was my hunting method.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But right now, I needed to bluff to enter the raid party. Therefore, I quoted the remark I heard about control. However,&nbsp;</span><span style>that was a big mistake.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban’s body was fully armed with heavy armor and a shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hoh... so people who wear armor aren’t skilled?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was smiling, but his eyes were cold.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was seriously angry.&nbsp;</span><span style>The problem was that the other party members around were also filled with righteous indignation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You make it sound like wearing armor and accessories is a bad thing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Listen to him; He never wears armor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Those who wear armor and accessories aren’t authentic? If we don’t want to be ignored, we should take it off...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I tried to calm down the angry people who were talking sarcastically,&nbsp;</span><span style>"That’s too much. I didn’t mean anything bad, I was just explaining why I am less dependent on defense.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Anyway, that means that I shouldn’t be armed! Your level is lower than mine!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wild-looking, hairy middle-aged person interrupted with a shout.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was equipped with two shining axes, armor and gorgeous ornaments, looking completely like a high-level user. He looked angrier than all the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grid? This is the first time I’ve seen you. You, have you done any hunting at the hunting grounds around here? I know how powerful the monsters in this area are. You sure must be confident if you’re bragging about hunting them without armor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other party members nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Based on his words, he must be a newbie to this area.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Have you ever seen someone called Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’ve never seen him at a nearby hunting ground. How about you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Honestly, it sounds like crap... I think he is actually lower than level 100.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Looking at him now, it seems like he died and dropped his items on a lone hunt. Maybe his intentions to enter the party are impure. He already has nothing to lose so...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The atmosphere was getting worse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Sharp people... What now? Should I give up on the party?'</span></p>
 <p><span style>As I was feeling confused... A blond haired man with his upper body revealed appeared and intervened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Everybody stop.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The party members became excited at the man’s appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"First place in the martial artist rankings, Regas.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The equipment items requirements are so severe that raising the level is difficult, yet he is already over level 180.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"His nickname is Taekwon Master, Taekwon Master. Is it true that a mob will melt when hit by his fists?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow~! He really came! I did well to join this party! Martial artists ignore defense to attack the weak point. Can’t this technique inflict huge damage to the Guardian of the Forest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas caught my eye and approached me.&nbsp;</span><span style>"A greatsword is very slow and has wide movements, so it isn’t easy to take evasive actions during battle. Therefore, it is amazing that you are hunting without wearing armor.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas was good looking, slim, and had ideal muscles. Due to the nature of his class, he was popular with women because he didn’t wear any tops.&nbsp;</span><span style>In fact, when I looked closer at him, I saw that he was, in fact, very handsome. I felt like a squid standing next to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>I instinctively hated handsome people so I replied bluntly,&nbsp;</span><span style>"It isn’t a big deal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hoh, it isn’t a big deal... My expectations about your skills have increased. I would love to directly see your amazing abilities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas said to the others,&nbsp;</span><span style>"This guy will also join the party. Originally, it was a party that had no limits on class or level. Some of the party members are below level 90, so I don’t think there’s a problem in accepting one more level 100 user.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>People still responded poorly, so Regas added,</span></p>
 <p><span style>"As you know, only level 170 or higher users can hit the Guardian of the Forest properly. Nevertheless, the reason why I gathered as many people as possible without a level limit is that people are needed to mark the golems constantly summoned by the Guardian of the Forest. The Guardian of the Forest will be dealt with by my 17 guild members, including Toban and Vantner. We want people to tie up the feet of the crystal golems while we focus on the Guardian of the Forest. I think that Grid’s skills are sufficient for our wishes.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He wants to join the party, so I don’t know why we should refuse. I can understand you doubting his actions, but why do you doubt people beforehand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The remarks of a strong person were reputable.&nbsp;</span><span style>Once Regas spoke, the party members had an atmosphere like they would accept me into the party.&nbsp;</span><span style>But they had impure intentions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let’s see how well his control is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Watch him fighting... We will see if he’s a braggart or not."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He said that he fights with his armor off? Then he can’t wear his armor on this raid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will watch him closely.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A party filled with intense hostility!&nbsp;</span><span style>This wasn’t a Guardian of the Forest raid party, but a Grid raid party.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can’t join this party.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If I joined the party now, I would have to fight in front of them.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a level -3 player, I would surely die quickly and not even see the Guardian of the Forest, let alone see the blue orichalcum. It would also come with extra embarrassment involved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s okay. I won’t join the party.”&nbsp;</span><span style>I stepped back, causing the middle-aged man to laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Were you just bluffing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An attitude that ignored people!&nbsp;</span><span style>But I didn’t get angry because his words were true.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I replied coldly,&nbsp;</span><span style>“It isn’t a good idea to join a party with people who don’t trust me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, party members should be able to trust each other with their backs. However, everyone here doubted me.&nbsp;</span><span style>The party members were forced to accept my words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well... that is true.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Come to think of it, we were so excited that we drove him to the other end.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I agree. I didn’t know if it was the truth, so I should’ve just stayed silent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right. Actually, weren’t we the ones who committed the sin? I feel bad now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I didn’t hold onto the party members any longer and left this place. Regas followed me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>My attitude was cold, but Regas just asked for a handshake with a gentle smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I hope to see you again next time, Greatsword warrior who doesn’t use armor. As a person who walks along the path of a martial artist, I am very interested in you."</span></p>
 <p><span style>I didn’t doubt that he was interested in me. I didn’t think it was a bluff as I gazed into his honest eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I shook hands with him and thought,&nbsp;</span><span style>‘Why is he so naive?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was a good person. If I had a chance someday, I would make him a friend that I could borrow money from.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then I’ll see you again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Take money from him later... no, I owed him. Therefore, I said goodbye to Regas with a big smile headed straight to the smithy.</span></p>
