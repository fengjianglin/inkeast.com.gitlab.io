 <p><span style>“Linked Kill Wave.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kukukukung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A thunderous sound burst from Grid’s sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the strongest skill, which cast Kill eight times continuously and attached the features of Wave to it, Linked Kill Wave.&nbsp;</span><span style>The momentum and strength was legendary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The new skill fusion has succeeded.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your intelligence has increased by 10 due to the successful fusion of a new skill.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Linked Kill Wave is added to the list of Pagma’s Swordsmanship techniques.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Linked Kill Wave]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Performs three sword dances simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Summons eight consecutive Kill attacks that inflicts 1,500% attack power, chasing all objects within a 2m radius.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The targets hit will have all speeds reduced by 50%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* This skill doesn’t share a cooldown with Link, Kill, and Wave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Mana Cost: 2,000</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: 20 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a targeted skill that dealt up to 12,000% damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>Depending on the number of targets, it could be used as a single or wide area skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>The three combination skill was several times stronger than the two combination skill, and the utilization was also high. It was truly a legendary skill.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The fierce momentum of Linked Wave Kill shot towards the clone.&nbsp;</span><span style>At first glance, it seemed to be Grid’s victory.&nbsp;</span><span style>But what about the clone?&nbsp;</span><span style>Just as Grid summoned Randy to deal with Linked Kill Wave, the clone could use the same method.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kyaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clone’s Randy was hit by Linked Kill Wave instead, turning him to grey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s eyes looked all over the place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Where?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Randy’s ‘Change Locations with the Copied Target’ was similar to Teleport.&nbsp;</span><span style>Depending on where Randy was when switching positions with the target, he could aim for the enemy’s blind spot.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid nervously looked around with the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A menacing aura of hatred and killing intent filled the air.&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone was using Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid determined that it was difficult to avoid or defend against and used a skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Freely Move.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the skill attached to the title ‘Secret Hero.’&nbsp;</span><span style>There were limits to the range of use, and the cooldown time was one hour. However, it was a top dashing skill that allowed him to avoid all non-targeting skills until he reached his target.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suuk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He avoided Kill and at the same time, leapt towards the clone and used Pinnacle.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Blood spurted from the clone’s chest.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the clone didn’t shrink back.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pinnacle had the advantage of being a targeted skill, but the power was less than Kill. It was difficult to inflict death on the clone who was armed with all types of items.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid defended against the clone’s counterattack.&nbsp;</span><span style>Since both sides had equal stats, no one was overwhelmed in a frontal battle. A tense contest began.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kikik!</span></i> <i><span style>Kkikikik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid exchanged blows with Grid’s Greatsword and provoked the clone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why don’t you use Pinnacle Kill? Won’t it be hard to beat me without that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clone didn’t say anything.&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone was Grid, but it capabilities were confined. The clone was a puppet doll without feelings.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reason for the clone’s existence was to kill Grid, so it had no thoughts or comments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Magic Missile."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Magic Missile."</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid and the clone looked at each other through interlocking swords and fired Magic Missiles, both of them flying back with damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This time, we did it simultaneously.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was satisfied.&nbsp;</span><span style>Previously, he hadn’t been able to use Magic Missile first and was one-sidedly hit.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pa pa pa pat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Four golden hands appeared behind the clone’s back.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the copied God Hands.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were armed with the Ideal Dagger, the Doppelganger’s Greatsword, Failure, and Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid also summoned the God Hands.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was truly spectacular.&nbsp;</span><span style>Four golden hands holding weapons were behind Grid and the clone.&nbsp;</span><span style>Someone who could use five weapons at the same time. It was a nonsensical fraudulent character from the point of view of an ordinary person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How can I take advantage of God Hands in this situation?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason Grid didn’t take out the God Hands was because it wasn’t useful.&nbsp;</span><span style>What would happen if he took out the God Hands?&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone would just use his God Hands to neutralize it, and it would eventually become a one-on-one match again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Cheook!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Did the clone want to prove Grid’s thoughts wrong?&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone started to actively make use of the God Hands.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hwiririk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘Wheel formation?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The God Hands formed a circular shape and rotated, wielding the weapons one after another at Grid’s God Hands.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rise and fall. Rise and fall.&nbsp;</span><span style>The effect of the wheel formation, which didn’t have any breaks between attacks, was amazing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s God Hands were completely overwhelmed and made obsolete.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is possible!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The commands that Grid gave to the God Hands were simple.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was classified as attack, defense and waiting.&nbsp;</span><span style>He only gave detailed commands when he wanted them to grab onto something.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because Grid didn’t have the ability to concentrate while giving more complex commands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Think about it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Focusing on battle while giving complex commands to four God Hands?&nbsp;</span><span style>An ordinary person couldn’t do it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the clone was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had the same stats as Grid, but was optimized for battle. Since he only existed to hurt Grid, his concentration was extremely excellent.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The clone’s God Hands kept rotating.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s God Hands were attacked with no time difference and they stiffened in order, then the clone’s God Hands flew towards Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, the God Hands couldn’t threaten Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The wheel formation?&nbsp;</span><span style>How funny.&nbsp;</span><span style>The God Hands only had level 2 intermediate Sword Mastery, so Grid was able to shake them off with no difficulty.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the problem was the time spent in the process.&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone approached while Grid was dealing with the God Hands and used Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Link.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pipit!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pipipipipit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Ku...ack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood splattered from Grid’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style>If the God Hands hadn’t lost their stiffness and flown over to defend him, Grid would’ve suffered unimaginable damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid fired Magic Missile and retreated in order to drink a health potion.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, there was no time to drink a potion because the clone’s God Hands attacked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Chaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was busy blocking the strikes of the God Hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Strong.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The difference in basic judgment ability and control was too great, despite the clone having the same stats and items.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ssik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A smile appeared on Grid’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was happy.&nbsp;</span><span style>He realized that he still had room to grow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to try and improve the control of the God Hands.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>After learning a new skill combination, now he could see the usefulness of the God Hands.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid grinned with joy as he commanded the God Hands to capture the fake ones.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this time, the clone started to deploy Pinnacle Kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I must look.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s concentration became extremely high.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kkuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A stronger force was added to the God Hands holding the fakes.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was testament to the fact that Grid’s order to ‘hold’ the God Hands was more elaborate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Pinnacle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clone’s sword moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Pinnacle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid showed an extreme concentration as he followed the actions of the clone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The curved orbit of Pinnacle changed to a straight line.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid did the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The new skill fusion has succeeded.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your intelligence has increased by 10 due to the successful fusion of a new skill.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Pinnacle Kill is added to the list of Pagma’s Swordsmanship techniques.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Pinnacle Kill]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Performs two sword dances simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deals 2,000% of your attack power to a specified target.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It changes the trajectory of the sword in the middle, making it hard to deal with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* This skill doesn’t share a cooldown with Pinnacle and Kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Mana Cost: 2,000</span></p>
 <p><span style>Health Consumed by Skill: 4,500</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: 5 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ack...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, blood poured from the nose and mouth of Grid and the clone.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the same time, both of them lost half their health.&nbsp;</span><span style>They quickly raised their swords and made different choices.&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone immediately used Linked Kill, while Grid summoned Noe to slow down the clone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The best demonic beast of hell has emerged! Nyahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe laughed as he appeared after a long time.&nbsp;</span><span style>But this laughter didn’t last long.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because Noe was hit by the clone’s Linked Kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kyaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe’s fur bristled.&nbsp;</span><span style>He got fresh air after a long time, but was surprised at instantly suffering a crisis.&nbsp;</span><span style>But who was Noe?&nbsp;</span><span style>The greatest demonic beast of hell, a memphis.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had the best speed in hell and the skill to minimize physical damage, Fluidization.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Noe barely escaped the second Linked Kill by using Fluidization.&nbsp;</span><span style>The guy with a cute mouth barely escaped! Then he opened his mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the manifestation of the worst skill, Soul Ingestion, which take away half of the highest stats of the target.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe swallowed up the clone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The effect of Soul Ingestion will increase your strength by 1,408 for the next minute.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Power boiled up inside him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid paused as he was about to use Linked Kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Will the clone also be able to summon Noe?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that his strength temporarily rose to 4,224, what if the clone summoned Noe and used Soul Ingestion?&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone’s strength would increase dramatically.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid visualized the worst case scenario and couldn’t easily attacked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stupid master! What nyang? Attack this guy! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe moved forward to deal a blow to the clone instead of his hesitating master.&nbsp;</span><span style>But despite the use of Fluidization, it was difficult to deal a fatal blow.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid heard Noe’s voice and rushed forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Linked Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was confused.&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone didn’t resist the attack and allowed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why didn’t the clone summon Noe?&nbsp;</span><span style>Did he read the question in Grid’s heart?&nbsp;</span><span style>Sticks admired Noe while explaining.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A memphis is the most perfect creature after a dragon, except for their personality. Even the mysterious Behen Archipelago can’t reproduce a memphis.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he had known this earlier, he would’ve summoned Noe from the beginning.&nbsp;</span><span style>No, if he did that, he might not have learned Linked Kill Wave and Pinnacle Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid smiled positively and opened up the distance as much as possible.</span></p>
