 <p><span style>Chapter 301</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>On the large screen, Elfin Stone scattered into black smoke.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an incredible result.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lim Cheolho stretched out a hand towards Yoon Sangmin and Team Leader Ashley, whose mouths were gaping open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Come on, give it to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two people pulled out a 50,000 won note.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh...! My allowance...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I won’t be able to buy chicken this week...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yoon Sangmin and Team Leader Ashley had some of the highest salaries in South Korea.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, they both had strict wives and only lived on a small amount of money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Their loss in the bet was really heartbreaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I shouldn’t have bet... I never imagined this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were convinced that Grid’s party wouldn’t succeed in the Elfin Stone raid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lim Cheolho smiled warmly.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Grid won because he blocked the first Blood Field. If Blood Field was deployed at the beginning of the raid, the Overgeared members wouldn’t have been able to hold on that long.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I agree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s skills were improving day by day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After reaching level 300 and waiting a short time to activate his newly acquired Item Combination skill, he could exert a fighting power comparable to the combat specialist legendary classes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was strong enough to transcend all presumptions.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a reason Grid was included in the ‘five people who could make miracles’ that Lim Cheolho mentioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But Grid... Isn’t it a little dangerous? Didn’t he die in the Blackening state?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chairman Lim Cheolho laughed at Yoon Sangmin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grid will get to experience a whole new world.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the meantime, Grid’s radius of activity was too narrow. The Human World. He was active only in the Eternal Kingdom on the continent.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was necessary to experience the wide world that two billion users enjoyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"In the first place, it isn’t a dangerous place. Most of the residents are friendly and similar to humans.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[You have died.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had died before in the past.&nbsp;</span><span style>He died four times to the green slime that even level 5 beginners could go against.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, death was unfamiliar to Grid after he became Pagma’s Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The last time was with Doran.&nbsp;</span><span style>It had been a long time since he struggled against Yura and died.&nbsp;</span><span style>If it was the Grid of the past, he would’ve been trembling about the penalties caused by death. He would’ve cursed.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now he was different. He was worried about the safety of his party members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is everybody okay?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wasn’t sure if the Elfin Stone raid succeeded.&nbsp;</span><span style>His mind had darkened the moment the 5th strike of Linked Kill had landed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Status window.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lv.300 (11.05%)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Hah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smiled as he checked the experience gauge on his status window.&nbsp;</span><span style>When he encountered Elfin Stone, Grid’s experience gauge was only 0%.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he had failed the Elfin Stone raid?&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, his level would’ve decreased. However, now his experience gauge was at 11%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The raid was a success."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The death penalty at level 300 meant a 30% drop in experience, so he had gained 41% experience from Elfin Stone. It was a huge number, as expected of a named boss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Everyone will be safe.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thank god.&nbsp;</span><span style>A relieved Grid was reminded of the pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Did he drop my pavranium?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no need to worry even if it didn’t drop.&nbsp;</span><span style>His party members would search the city for it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the meantime, I...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The durability of his items was ruined by death.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, the item combination meant that Failure only had 10 durability remaining. If things went wrong, it would’ve been destroyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I need to repair my items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid turned to head to Khan’s smithy and hesitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Where is this place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s resurrection point was Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>The landscape that unfolded before his eyes should be familiar.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the surrounding scenery was unfamiliar.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a small and tranquil village with around 20 shacks.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid stood alone in the center of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The confused Grid unfolded the map. However, Grid’s location wasn’t marked anywhere on the map.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the hell is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid frowned and swept over the village.&nbsp;</span><span style>There wasn’t a general store in the village. There were just 20 shacks, macaroon trees, and a small stream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There aren’t any people.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid picked a sweet and sour macaroon and placed it in his mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why did he resurrect here instead of Reidan?&nbsp;</span><span style>A bug was unlikely. He never once heard of a bug being discovered in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s thinking ability was unable to analyze the current situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I need to go back to Reidan.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to do that, he needed to know his current location.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid tried to ask the guild members for assistance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Does anyone know my location right now?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have failed to send a message to the guild. Hell is disconnected from the human world.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Hell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell was a place with a blue sky and warm breezes?&nbsp;</span><span style>Shouldn’t hell be darker and filled with lava?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dammit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Grid revealed his nature.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is hell! I fell down into hell!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he knew this, he would’ve lived a nice... No, he would’ve paid more attention to his demonic power figure!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I killed too many people in the empire, the Vatican, and Winston.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid currently had 401 demonic power.&nbsp;</span><span style>It happened when Grid was sure that he fell into hell because his demonic power was too high.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They are...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A group was entering through the entrance of the village.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had strange appearances.&nbsp;</span><span style>Some men had horns on their foreheads, while some women had purple skin.&nbsp;</span><span style>They didn’t look strong, but it was hard to see them as humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Demonkin?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t want to fight when the durability of his items was so low.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demonkin found Grid who was trying to run away.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was so fast that Grid failed to escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Damn... In the end I have to fight. But demonkin do farming?'</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demonkin held farming equipment in their hands and their clothes were dirty.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was like Piaro’s usual appearance.&nbsp;</span><span style>The demonkin asked him a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A traveller...? Why would a traveller come to a place like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demonkin weren’t wary or hostile towards Grid. They treated him normally.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was great for Grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The demonkin aren’t hostile towards humans?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid felt doubt and suddenly looked down at his hands.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were pale.&nbsp;</span><span style>He looked at the rest of his body, but it was the same.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid realized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Blackening wasn’t over.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was currently in a half demon state.&nbsp;</span><span style>The demonkin perceived him as their own people.&nbsp;</span><span style>An old demonkin put down a basket full of unfamiliar plants and looked benignly at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You seem stiff for some reason. Don’t be nervous. Everyone’s just curious because it has been almost 100 years since a visitor came to this village. Wasn’t it an exhausting trip? Would you like to have a meal? As you can see, this is a poor village and we can only cook Atura grass.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Grass? You eat grass? You don’t eat humans?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid blinked and questioned.&nbsp;</span><span style>The demonkin laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This young friend made a funny joke.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How can we eat humans?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We are fortunate not to be eaten by humans.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their perception of humans was quite strange.&nbsp;</span><span style>These demonkin seemed different from the stories that Grid had heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Living in this shabby neighborhood... Are they weak among the demonkin?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Grid cocked his head with surprise.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was became a demonkin called Helmis came up and grabbed his wrist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Do they know that I am human?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was nervous as Helmis looked at his hands with interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Looking at your calluses, you are a blacksmith? Isn’t this very interesting? I’ve never heard that there was another blacksmith among the demonkin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Blacksmith?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blacksmith among the demonkin?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Perhaps...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was the one who made Iyarugt a demonkin?</span></p>
 <p><span style>A notification window popped up in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Blackening will end in one minute.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blackening wasn’t lifted even if he died.&nbsp;</span><span style>The problem was that it wouldn’t last forever.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t know what would happen if he changed back to a human here.&nbsp;</span><span style>The demonkin were surprisingly good people so Grid asked them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you know how to go to the Human World?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demonkin said hopelessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We don’t know either. Even the great demons can’t freely enter the human world, so how can trivial people like us know the way?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why do you want to go to the Human World? You, aren’t you a little strange?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Something is suspicious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demonkin started to question Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Did I screw up?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid gulped.&nbsp;</span><span style>At that moment, Noe jumped out of Grid’s pet inventory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nyang! It was the smell of home!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The short-legged cat sniffed and his tail waved as he smelled the familiar scent of hell.&nbsp;</span><span style>Looking at his bright expression, Noe seemed quite happy. He even seemed to be doing a shoulder dance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Cute.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wanted to continue watching Noe dance.&nbsp;</span><span style>The demonkin’s faces turned pale as they gazed at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Heok! M-Memphis!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The best demonic beast of hell!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The astonished demonkin shouted and knelt down when they saw Noe.&nbsp;</span><span style>A memphis.&nbsp;</span><span style>The most intelligent and mighty servants of the great demons, they were objects of worship for common demonkin.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Noe finally noticed the bowing demonkin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah! Do you see Master? This body is so great!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid scolded him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You only hid when I was trying to hunt Elfin Stone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe’s expression changed rapidly.&nbsp;</span><span style>The demonkin started speculating when they heard Noe called Grid his master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“M-Memphis’ Master!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We didn’t know who you were and we dared offend you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although they were demonkin, they were also friendly people who invited him for a meal.&nbsp;</span><span style>It happened when Grid was about to answer them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The duration of Blackening is over.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your demonic power is sealed and your species has returned to a human being.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[It is impossible for ordinary humans to enter hell. You are expelled from hell.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s vision blurred.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then after a moment, he opened his eyes at Reidan’t resurrection point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Grid! Are you okay?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{What, why were you marked in an unknown location?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was an uproar in the guild chat window.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka and the Pavranium Expedition members were clamoring.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid could feel how worried they were.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The Elfin Stone raid must’ve succeeded if they can make contact with the outside world.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Grid! Look look! These are the items Elfin Stone dropped!}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Really amazing! A growth type item! We didn’t even know that these items existed!}</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t because he checked the item options of Elfin Stone’s Ring and Iyarugt that was shared by the party members.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was another reason why he was surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You came.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Yura?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why was she here?&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura looked at Grid and her cheeks puffed out.&nbsp;</span><span style>She could make a cute face like this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura was standing next to Lauel and the Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Acting like this because she’s pretty. Tsk tsk, those pathetic guys.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was smiling despite this.&nbsp;</span><span style>The power of beauty was truly great.</span></p>
