 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent had been playing Satisfy since the closed beta.&nbsp;</span><span style>He went through a lot of adventures, so he knew better than anyone how vast the world was.&nbsp;</span><span style>A farmer was stronger than him?&nbsp;</span><span style>He could accept it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, it wasn’t surprising if a legendary farmer could use a meteor type skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The legendary fisherman might be friends with the dragon king by now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were many hermits in this world.&nbsp;</span><span style>But there was one thing that Hurent couldn’t accept.&nbsp;</span><span style>A legendary farmer was excellent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Then why was he Grid’s subordinate?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid, where is your limit?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gained a legendary class faster than anybody else, and now he also had a legendary NPC?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was an object of hatred, but Hurent had to acknowledge his superior abilities.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro reached out to the frustrated Hurent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crazy farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t even blink after killing thousands of people, making him look strange.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent wanted to resist.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, his body wasn’t in a state where it could move.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, he had to give up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I will follow. Drag me to Grid, where you can boil or bake me to your heart’s content.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, you will do farming with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was he really crazy?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was funny to say this with his own mouth, but Hurent was the leader of an army that wanted to invade Reidan. From Reidan’s point of view, he was a sinner that they could acquire a lot of information from. As a person of high importance, it was right to handle him carefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he was going to do farming?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was surreal and his ego was hurt.&nbsp;</span><span style>Did Piaro read his mind?&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro made a ridiculing sound at Hurent’s expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The leader of an army who died before reaching Reidan has no value. You just have to think about doing farming.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eek!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent’s ego was shattered.&nbsp;</span><span style>He panicked and made a mistake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have a lot of confidential information! If you don’t obtain the information from me, Reidan will be turned into a sea of fire! So treat me as a high priority prisoner!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh, really?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro’s expression changed.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the moment Piaro transformed from a farmer into the commander of Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent realized his mistake.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuheok! Cough! Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The explosion of countless wheat was enormous.&nbsp;</span><span style>More than half of the 2,000 soldiers died, and the rest were seriously injured.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bunny Bunny’s state was in the middle.&nbsp;</span><span style>He barely survived with 15% of his health left and he was gripped with an unknown terror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He is a huge monster!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reidan’s crazy farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rumor had it that he overwhelmed the 2nd ranked Zibal and the 3rd ranked Chris, turning Chris into a serf.&nbsp;</span><span style>The rumor that he blocked the seven guilds alone(?) was also not an exaggeration. </span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How terrible was Zibal’s fight with that monster?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The world was wide and there were many monsters.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bunny Bunny was caught in a desire to capture all of them with his camera.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to become a conglomerate by monopolizing all the viewers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But to do this, he needed to survive.&nbsp;</span><span style>Swiftness was needed to catch all types of scoop, so he steadily raised his agility with every level. It should be enough to avoid death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'The first thing is to live.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was enough that he captured video of the rumored farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style>The farmer made a wheat field in an instant and used it for an explosion that destroyed most of the 2,000 soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was no longer any reason to stay here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Hurent?&nbsp;</span><span style>Wasn’t Hurent going to get revenge on Grid?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Heok!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuack!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuheeok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at Hurent being hit three times on the forehead with a hand plow, Hurent’s desire for revenge on Grid seemed like a dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Discard Hurent!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny determined, wore the ‘Fast Boots,’ and quickly left the battlefield.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was planning to join Prince Ren.&nbsp;</span><span style>Prince Ren had many talents who were above Hurent.&nbsp;</span><span style>What if he filmed the gorgeous clash between them and Overgeared?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will be sitting on money! I must shoot a video worth 100 billion dollars today!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny’s aspirations were great.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Where have all the kids gone? Why don’t I see any of the guild members?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After playing with Lord.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid stopped by Lauel’s office before going to the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style>As always, paper was piled up like a mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Everybody is busy. They aren’t at the estate because they are committed to their missions or hunting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aren’t they only hunting in the vampire cities?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That is the most efficient method. Aside from the experience, vampire items and elixirs can be obtained. The desert ecosystem is in a fairly stable state, so this is appropriate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Did anyone find an elixir?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The drop rate was truly the worst.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a shame for Grid, who coveted the agility elixir.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel asked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you remember how 10 years ago, the former lord of Reidan sent out an expedition to the vampire cities?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I remember. Why are you asking about it all of a sudden?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s annoying because the Overgeared members haven’t found any traces of the vampire expedition, despite searching all over the vampire cities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why is it annoying? It was 10 years ago, so is it strange for all evidence to be wiped out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. The records left behind showed that there were close to 18,000 people on the vampire expedition. It is normal that some traces of them should remain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Well, there are many vampire cities that we haven’t visited yet. The evidence might be somewhere there. But is it an important issue?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"At the present time, no.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"At the present time? Then it could become an important issue later on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Grid asked the question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Earl Lauel”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A young knight ran into the office.&nbsp;</span><span style>Entering the office without even knocking on the door?&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel was offended, but this didn’t seem like a situation where etiquette was important.&nbsp;</span><span style>The knight’s entire body was covered in wounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aren’t you one of Marquis Steim’s knights? What is going on?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Well... Heok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The knight was going to explain to Lauel when he panicked.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because he noticed Grid sitting on the couch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-I greet Duke Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid waved his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no time to say hello so please explain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah, yes! 5,000 enemy troops are advancing towards Reidan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"5,000 enemy troops?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The face of the knight was filled with despair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is the royal troops!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Royal troops? Eternal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes! Sir Laden is leading the 1,000 northern soldiers to slow the enemy’s march, but it’s a terrible situation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid couldn’t believe it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is the royal army of the Eternal Kingdom coming to invade Reidan? Aren’t we on the same side?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style>“The rice that we sowed was eaten.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sowed rice...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Grid in the past would’ve failed to understand the present situation until the end.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Lauel had been his subordinate for 9 months in reality and 27 months in game time.&nbsp;</span><span style>It had been so long, so how could Grid not learn something?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Did King Wiesbaden die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style>He honestly never imagined that Grid would guess this himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He has grown steadily, but to think he reached this level!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The astonished Lauel was speechless for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This situation is interesting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid rose from his spot and smiled darkly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lauel, have Asmophel convene the soldiers. It’s time for the storm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid headed towards his private warehouse.&nbsp;</span><span style>The warehouse was filled with ‘Mass Production Grid Sets.’</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“M-Marquis Steim... I couldn’t hold out until the end...I’m sorry... Cough! Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 1,000 troops led by Laden and 10 knights.&nbsp;</span><span style>They fell into a crisis after wiping out the Iron Wind troops.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because he was caught by the unit led by the great swordsman, Chucksley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re great.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Swordsman Chucksley.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was comparable to the past Piaro of the empire.&nbsp;</span><span style>He praised Laden, who defended against his sword four times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“20 years later. No, you might’ve been able to hit me in 10 years. I have never seen anyone with such a terrific talent like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pant... Pant...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laden had defeated Beida and several others talents alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was exhausted and at a disadvantage when facing Chucksley.&nbsp;</span><span style>To be honest, it wouldn’t be strange if he collapsed immediately.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Laden didn’t show weakness to the end.&nbsp;</span><span style>He knew that the moment he fell, the 1,000 troops he treasured would be wiped out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to give my all for My Lord.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt disappointment and despair at not meeting expectations.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kkuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Laden tightened his grip on his sword. He ignored the blood in his mouth and laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure? I don’t need 10 years. Five years. No, I will go beyond you in three years.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chucksley’s face distorted.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was unable to deny Laden’s arrogant remark, making him feel uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isn’t that only if you survive?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, try to survive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chucksley’s family had been loyal to the royal family for generations.&nbsp;</span><span style>For him, Marquis Steim was an annoying presence that could threaten the royal family.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was more so after his son-in-law became Duke Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a golden opportunity to catch both Marquis Steim and Duke Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was fortunate that he met the northern troops by chance in the desert.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was evidence that Marquis Steim was in Reidan!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chucksley’s swordsmanship was sophisticated without any deviations.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was faithful to the basics, which excluded any variables.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, it wasn’t something that Laden, who lacked training and experience, could go against.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Chaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the exchange of blows continued, Laden’s wounds increased while Chucksley’s technique became sharper.&nbsp;</span><span style>The northern army and Chucksley’s Black unit were clearly divided as they watched the confrontation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘We won.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is over.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Black unit cheered while the northern troops were frustrated.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this moment, 5,000 soldiers appeared on the horizon.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was it the appearance of a friend like a miracle?&nbsp;</span><span style>No way.&nbsp;</span><span style>The identity of the great army was the main troops of Prince Ren, the enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tears flowed down Laden’s bloody and dirty cheeks as he saw it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘My Lord...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt guilty for his lacking strength.</span></p>
