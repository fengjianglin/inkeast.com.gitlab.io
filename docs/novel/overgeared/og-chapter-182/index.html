 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>No matter if this was a legendary class, wasn’t it too strong?&nbsp;</span><span style>Defeating famous rankers in a matter of seconds? It was a class that would collapse the balance.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, Pagma’s Descendant wasn’t a pure combat class, but a production class.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was Pagma's Descendant intended to be this strong? Was it perhaps a bug?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid defeated Aura Master Hurent in 5 seconds and Bondre in 4 seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style>His stunning world debut, devastating Satisfy’s strongest players in a single blow, caused huge waves.&nbsp;</span><span style>Public opinion was boiling.&nbsp;</span><span style>The S.A. Group was flooded with inquiries.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Chairman Lim Cheolho judged that he needed to calm the atmosphere and spoke directly.&nbsp;</span><span style>The balance didn’t collapse.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pagma's Descendant was intended to be this strong, and it wasn’t a bug.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were a total of nine legendary classes. They were special classes only for the chosen nine people.&nbsp;</span><span style>All of them were immune to CC.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s right. The CC Immunity was a passive skill that all nine legendary classes had in common and was a privilege exclusively for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was it too much privilege?&nbsp;</span><span style>What could he do?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, the world wasn’t fair.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was always one person ahead of others when it came to achievements or luck.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was everyone equal in the world?&nbsp;</span><span style>Would that world be fun?&nbsp;</span><span style>A game where no matter how hard you tried, you would end up being like someone else? Would anyone play that game?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, he was well aware that normal classes might feel deprived.&nbsp;</span><span style>They didn’t need to worry.&nbsp;</span><span style>Satisfy was a world designed to make everyone happy, even if they weren’t equal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Didn’t they already directly experience it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ability of all normal classes shot significantly upwards after the second advancement. With such a formula, their abilities would improve even more after the third advancement, and the gap with the legendary classes would gradually be narrowed.&nbsp;</span><span style>If the third advancement was still lacking? Then there was the fourth advancement class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy was a game built to reward everyone.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was inevitable that the hidden classes would lead the way, but if they played the game to the best of their ability, someday the normal class users would catch up to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lim Cheolho, the creator of the virtual reality, was already deified.&nbsp;</span><span style>Satisfy had been released for one year and eight months, and not a single bug had been found.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lim Cheolho’s credibility was absolute for creating such a perfect world.&nbsp;</span><span style>Most of the people in the world were convinced by Lim Cheolho’s remark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The controversy about Grid quickly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...I never thought the day would come when I would lie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the press conference.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lim Cheolho’s expression wasn’t bright as he returned to his office.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pagma's Descendant was intended to be this strong and it wasn’t a bug.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This remark.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, it wasn’t a bug.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it was true that this went against the intentions of the creators.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pagma's Descendant should be more normal and weaker than he was now.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid had become stronger than was originally planned for Pagma’s Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Umm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lim Cheolho sat in a chair and recalled Grid’s actions in the PvP.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was overwhelming strength that surpassed insufficient senses and control.&nbsp;</span><span style>The foundation of that strength was his abnormally high stats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was the reason for Grid’s high stats?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid spent too long making five legendary items after becoming Pagma’s Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Originally, he should’ve made five legendary items four months earlier than he did, making his stat growth beyond what was expected...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was too lacking in game talent.&nbsp;</span><span style>So he didn’t take advantage of the benefits of his class and wasted his time. He was stagnant for a long time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Furthermore, he was very unlucky.&nbsp;</span><span style>He fell to a minus level and could barely create legendary items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to that, he avoided the planned penalty and Pagma’s Descendant received much higher stats than the creators planned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>His growth slowed due to insufficient game talent, but this was actually good luck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kulkul... Indeed, a protagonist is a special existence...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the time of the Pope Drevigo raid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had claimed he was a protagonist.&nbsp;</span><span style>And he certainly showed the actions of a protagonist.&nbsp;</span><span style>By getting rid of the corrupt pope, he saved thousands of the Rebecca people and helped Damian become the first unique class, Goddess' Agent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So far, the protagonist of Satisfy was definitely Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He changed the landscape of Satisfy with every action he took.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He isn’t the only protagonist.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The supercomputer Morpheus reported.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The current time is 13:01:27. Quest RD-3991X has been completed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lim Cheolho’s gaze was fixed on the extra large monitor on the wall of the office.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a man on the monitor that was surrounded by dozens of screens.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ID was Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had maintained the 1st ranking since Satisfy opened.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the first to reach level 300 and at this moment, he achieved his third advancement class.&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite being a normal class, he became a ‘sword saint’ candidate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Quest RD-3991X is... The White Swordsman class?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, Kraugel was moving from the Western Continent to the Eastern Continent.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the first user.&nbsp;</span><span style>Krugel became the first to leave footprints on the white snow that no one had stepped on yet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘By completing a large number of quests first, he will gobble up more than a few titles. This will make him an even more unique person.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lim Cheolho thought for a moment before asking a question out of pure curiosity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If the current Grid fought with Kraugel, who will win?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[There is a 51.3% probability that Kraugel will win.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Even before he receives the new titles...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once again, the world wasn’t fair.&nbsp;</span><span style>Just as there was a unique genius called Lim Cheolho in the scientific community, there was a unique genius called Kraugel in the game world.&nbsp;</span><span style>Originally, no one could exceed them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there was no Grid in the scientific world, while there was Grid in the game world.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wondered how long Kraugel’s solo dominance could continue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid has already exceeded numerous geniuses.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was it just exceeding?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid started to gather numerous geniuses around him.&nbsp;</span><span style>In contrast, Kraugel was alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>Later, would Grid be able to surpass Kraugel?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lim Cheolho was looking forward to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The existence that would reign at the top of the world he created, would it be a genius or a dunce?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was very interesting.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>3rd on the unified rankings, Chris.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was also the master of the strongest Giant Guild, and predicted it the moment the PvP event began.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The opponent I will meet in the finals is Grid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the round of 32, Grid faced Hurent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Most people thought that Hurent would defeat Grid. Then the round of 16 would be a match between Hurent and Bondre, and the winner of the fight was expected to make it to the final.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Chris thought differently.&nbsp;</span><span style>He predicted that Grid would win against Hurent and Bondre and come up to the final match.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, I never predicted he would do it in 5, then 4 seconds.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was Chris scared?&nbsp;</span><span style>No.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was somewhat nervous, but not afraid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rather, his blood was boiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I am also someone who deals deadly blows.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris used a greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was able to handle a greatsword much better than Grid. He didn’t think he would be defeated in a frontal match.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’m a little bit behind in stats.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The difference in stats wasn’t important.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he used his ultimate greatsword strike, he could deal a deadly blow to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris had much better techniques than Grid and could overpower him.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was determined to beat Grid, the ‘Butcher’ who smashed the Giant Guild in the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there was a presence who blocked him in the round of 16.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an opponent he didn’t consider at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The British representative, Regas.&nbsp;</span><span style>Obviously, Regas was at the peak in L.T.S.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris wasn’t a match for Regas in L.T.S.&nbsp;</span><span style>That changed once Satisfy opened.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris started Satisfy half a year earlier than Regas, so he was way ahead.&nbsp;</span><span style>Originally, it should’ve been easy to get rid of Regas.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The kneeling Chris.&nbsp;</span><span style>His expression was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas was too strong.&nbsp;</span><span style>He used the distinctive brilliance of martial arts and combined them with powerful blows.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was hard to read the orbits of his kicks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris' health dropped to half quickly.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris confirmed the cooldown of his potions and started a conversation in order to buy time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You’re much stronger than you were in the target processing. What type of magic did you conjure?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the target processing event, Regas had trouble with the 33rd ranked Med.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wasn’t Chris’ opponent.&nbsp;</span><span style>How did he become this strong in a matter of days?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas explained to the confused Chris.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I have a weapon, so there’s a very big difference.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A chill went down Chris’ spine.&nbsp;</span><span style>He belatedly noticed the knuckles on Regas’ hands.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris was reminded that Regas always had bare hands.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was able to realize how Regas became so crazy strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you perhaps...!? You have been playing the game without weapons so far!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought it was a luxury for martial artists to use weapons. But this PvP competition is an exception. It’s a courtesy to do my best when dealing with the strongest opponents.”</span></p>

 <p><span style>Regas had never used a weapon since Satisfy started.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to this, the S.A. Group called him a ‘crazy person.’</span></p>

 <p><i><span style>Kurururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Lion’s Castle, that was barely maintaining its shape, was swallowed up by lightning.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was a complete collapse.&nbsp;</span><span style>The once flourishing Lion’s Castle disappeared into history. It was a scene that represented the decline of the Bonkost Principality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 C-Chris has been logged out...! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris was one of the strongest candidates.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now, the only hope to face Grid was defeated by the 13th ranked Regas?&nbsp;</span><span style>People were in shock.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, the Canadians were resentful and frustrated that Canada wasn’t even ranked third overall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 After many surprises, the final four have been determined. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 It’s amazing. Three out of the four contestants are members of the Tzedakah Guild. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Grid, Regas and Pon. The Tzedakah Guild, which is said to be the strongest group in Satisfy, is clearly showing its status. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everybody is strong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka supported everyone.&nbsp;</span><span style>But among them, she especially cheered for Grid over Regas and Pon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon and Regas met in the round of 4 and fought for 17 minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style>The splendor of Taekwondo and the spear made people crazy.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, Regas won.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a victory determined by just a slight difference.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will win next time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon neatly admitted his defeat. The friendship of the two people became more solid.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Grid confronted the 25th ranked Bubat.&nbsp;</span><span style>The result was that Bubat forfeited.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a waste of time to fight with Grid, who was immune to Bubat’s CC.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the finals that followed immediately afterwards, Grid won against Regas.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unlike before, it wasn’t an overwhelming victory.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid allowed up to 8 combos from Regas’ knuckles and suffered a brief crisis.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the fight quickly reversed due to the +9 Failure’s overwhelming attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas gradually realized the importance of items. His superfluous pride as a martial artist blurred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Grid has won! As a result, South Korea is third on the overall rankings! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>South Korea was the country with the highest potential to not even win a bronze medal in this National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid had won gold medals in the target processing and PvP, raising South Korea’s ranking to third.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a tremendous achievement that no one could foresee.&nbsp;</span><span style>South Korea was enthusiastic. It was an entirely festive mood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The overall rankings:</span></p>
 <p><span style>1st place United States: 3 gold medals. 2 silver medals. 1 bronze medal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>2nd place France: 2 gold medals. 1 silver medal. 2 bronze medals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>3rd place South Korea: 2 gold medals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>4th place Canada: 1 gold medal. 2 silver medals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The National Competition wasn’t over yet.&nbsp;</span><span style>The pet marathon remained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Now it’s the end of Grid’s role.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The United States would solidify their first place.&nbsp;</span><span style>Or France would take away the first place.&nbsp;</span><span style>Maybe Canada might reclaim the third place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The users with drake pets participated in the pet marathon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 It’s known that there are less than 100 people in Satisfy who have drakes as pets. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Drakes are the most powerful pet. They have tremendous speed, stamina and combat power. A country with a lot of drakes will become the winner of this pet marathon. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Grid has also placed his name on the list for the pet marathon. Does Grid have a drake as a pet? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Even if Grid is a drake user, it’s useless. There isn’t one user in Korea who uses a drake as a pet. The other drakes will concentrate on Grid’s drake and he will eventually be eliminated. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 In the end, South Korea will finish fourth in the National Competition. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a natural analysis.&nbsp;</span><span style>The pet marathon was an event where only the pets participated, not the players.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was impossible for Grid’s pet to win this event unless it had a legendary rank like Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>As it happened, all drakes had the same rating. The only difference was their attributes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Summon Drake!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yurea island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>40 players representing each country logged into the huge island that was the size of Jeju Island.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the summoned drakes roared.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kyaooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwaaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Fire, frost, poison, wind, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The breaths with different attributes emerged as the drakes roared!&nbsp;</span><span style>The crowd was speechless as they were overwhelmed by the spectacular sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid summoned a cat.&nbsp;</span><span style>People’s expressions twisted.</span></p>
