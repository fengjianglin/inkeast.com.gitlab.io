 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The day before the seven guilds invaded Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon and Regas travelled through the desert and discovered a dungeon entrance that reminded them of an ant hill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This dungeon isn’t marked on the map, is it?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Regas asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon checked the map and nodded. Then Regas immediately entered the dungeon.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was no time to stop him. It was a really remarkable performance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pon followed after Regas.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>10 seconds after they entered the dungeon.&nbsp;</span><span style>The entrance to the dungeon disappeared into the desert.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon and Regas were surprised after entering the dungeon, and then a series of notification windows appeared in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have entered the Vampire’s Underground City (13).]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Benefits will be given to the first dungeon finders! The gold and item drop rate in the dungeon will increase by 8%! This benefit will last for 10 days and will disappear when you die.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was regrettable that the experience rate didn’t increase, but it was still good. But the rest was the problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The entrance of the dungeon is blocked. Contact with the outside world will be blocked.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You can’t escape the dungeon until you have died or kill the dungeon boss.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an unusual type of dungeon.&nbsp;</span><span style>The most powerful duo in Overgeared were tasked with ‘collecting information about the western dungeons and finding the ideal hunting ground.’&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the moment that they fell into a desperate crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We’re trapped...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon was well aware of vampires.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were a top-ranking combat species that possessed attack cancelling skills and enchanting skills. They were especially strong in dark places.&nbsp;</span><span style>The entry of light was completely blocked and they were trapped in a city of vampires...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘We will die.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Pon was feeling frustrated, Regas looked at the dungeon unfolding before him with bright eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isn’t it unbelievably amazing here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>High buildings and pointed spires.&nbsp;</span><span style>Gothic buildings reminiscent of Notre Dame Cathedral and Cologne Cathedral were scattered throughout the dark dungeon.&nbsp;</span><span style>The spectacular and dreary scenery overwhelmed the onlookers, but Regas was pleased about finding a new dungeon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We should hunt before the buff ends.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyone would be afraid of the death penalty. In particular, it was more severe for rankers.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Regas wasn’t afraid of death. He might be 12th on the unified rankings, but he enjoyed the challenge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'In any case, this is fun.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas smiled at the sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon smiled and moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had to fight anyway, so they should do it thoroughly.&nbsp;</span><span style>It would be ideal if they killed all the vampires and boss before the buff ended.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon and Regas moved in secret.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the start of an epic struggle.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Jude.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was Grid’s knight and served at the captain of the security forces in Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would stop any harm from happening to Duke Grid’s city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was Jude’s perspective.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Captain, get some rest now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no rest for Jude.&nbsp;</span><span style>He always tried to maintain Reidan’s safety, except for when he slept.&nbsp;</span><span style>He even ate when he was patrolling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Captain is admirable.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to work harder!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jude chewing dry bread while patrolling became a model for the soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style>The soldiers of Reidan became more diligent every day. They endured the harsh training and their growth speed was very fast.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were basically overgeared soldiers, so it was only a matter of time before they were reborn as elites.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Today. Reidan. Safe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jude didn’t know.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One night a week ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hundreds of people had tried to invade Reidan while he was sleeping.&nbsp;</span><span style>He never knew that they were repelled by only four farmers.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was it because he was an idiot with only 20 intelligence?</span></p>
 <p><span style>No.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was Lauel’s intent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel didn’t announce the Reidan invasion so that the people weren’t disturbed.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was easy to cover up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It was night time and the enemies could only reach the wheat fields outside the walls. They even retreated quickly.&nbsp;</span><span style>Only a few people knew about what happened that night. It was sad, but Jude wasn’t included in this minority.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jude. Today. Strong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Today, Reidan was peaceful.&nbsp;</span><span style>The people believed it was due to Jude’s merits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Captain Jude! Please work hard today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Thank you!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jude was proud every time people greeted him. He worked harder as he patrolled.&nbsp;</span><span style>Everything was for Duke Grid.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[The hidden quest ‘Fun and Enjoyable Training!’ has been completed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as the notification window popped up, Kraugel put down the farming equipment that he had been holding for a month.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The end.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was disappointing.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was glad to be able to leave on new adventures, but he was sorry to say goodbye to Reidan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>In hindsight, this was the first time he’d stayed in one place for so long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’ll miss it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked over the vast wheat fields.&nbsp;</span><span style>The fun and precious memories from the last month, which couldn’t be forgotten, were engraved on his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m leaving.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He approached an impressive middle-aged man with a commanding presence and deep gaze.&nbsp;</span><span style>The fact that he wasn’t a simple person could be seen from his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>The first ranked Kraugel couldn’t win against him in the end.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel smiled gently and bowed deeply to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Thank you for everything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the luck of a lifetime that he met Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to working tirelessly in the field and sparring with Piaro, Kraugel could finally cross the wall.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sword Saint 4th Stage.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was one more step until he became a sword saint.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should come back here often. You’re always welcome.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro reached out his hand.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a dirty hand covered with calluses.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel could see a little bit of the road that Piaro had been walking in the meantime.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel grabbed the hand politely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Brother.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then when he next came to visit...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will be the best.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel had been greatly disappointed when Piaro became a farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style>He thought that Piaro gave up the road to being a sword saint.&nbsp;</span><span style>But that wasn’t it.&nbsp;</span><span style>He realized it when they were together.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro didn’t give up. He chose a more suitable path for himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The class wasn’t important.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was important that he was a legend.&nbsp;</span><span style>Currently, Piaro succeeded in combining farming equipment with swordsmanship, and Sword Saint Muller couldn’t even be compared. Piaro had become the strongest man.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to compete with him...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I also have to become a legend.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sword saint.&nbsp;</span><span style>It didn’t matter how long it would take, Kraugel was determined to achieve it.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to become equal to Piaro and face him.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have noticed.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A man wearing a straw hat was saying goodbye to Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t take off his hat to the end. Faker followed him and as soon as he left Reidan, he used White Light Steps. </span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It truly is him...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faker was convinced after seeing the white light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The sky above the sky.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The peak of two billion users, Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wouldn’t be hard for him to throw Faker off his scent.&nbsp;</span><span style>A faint smile broke out on Faker’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel had a relationship with Reidan and might become a positive influence on Grid later on.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[The hidden quest ‘Fun and Enjoyable Training!’ has been completed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was eight days after Kraugel left.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian also finished the quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian confirmed his ascending stats and skill level from the quest reward and was filled with joy.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was unbelievable compensation for such a short period of time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian achieved a dramatic growth compared to three weeks ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It would’ve been nice to share this joy with Rin-chan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian felt regret.&nbsp;</span><span style>He turned his attention to the horizon beyond the wheat field.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Now I just have to wait for Grid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Today was the day that Grid was scheduled to return.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian was filled with expectations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If Grid could seal Lifael’s Spear...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel-chan could be saved.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, he was worried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'What if Grid refuses my request?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Grid that Damian knew was a very greedy person.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t imagine that such a person would help others out of simple goodwill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Lauel says I should have faith, but...'</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had to prepare for the worst.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian started to prepare the treasures to be given to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He disposed of all items except for his main equipment, and even changed his savings to gold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I’m willing to sell my house...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian firmed up his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And that night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid finally returned. Asmophel was with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you been well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid returned after five weeks and was now level 295.&nbsp;</span><span style>He grew even more after a long journey, making the Overgeared members overwhelmed.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, Lauel was feeling a thrill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘G-Great!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eyes that shone with a red light!&nbsp;</span><span style>It was completely to Lauel’s taste.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid scratched his head as he looked at the people around him. His eyes were tinged with affection.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian shook his head from where he was standing behind the Overgeared members and looked at Grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What’s this? He doesn’t know that his city was invaded?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The invasion of Reidan by the seven guilds was a global issue. Even people who didn’t play Satisfy a lot were aware of this incident thanks to the news.&nbsp;</span><span style>Therefore, it was surprising that the person involved, Grid, wasn’t aware of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Were you so busy with the quest that you didn’t watch TV?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes. I’m so busy playing the game that I reduced my sleeping time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This quest was annoying in many ways.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a long distance to Titan and Asmophel’s mansion was hard to find. It was due to the wards installed by Dark Bus.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid trembled as he recalled the day he saw Titan, the biggest city on the continent, much bigger than Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was lucky that the last boss was weak. If the opponent had been strong, he would’ve started crying. </span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I had a hard time but it was worth it. The reward was good and most of all, it was linked with a hidden quest.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wanted to finish this quest by reuniting Piaro and Asmophel as soon as possible.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he would logout, wash, and go to sleep. He also missed his mother’s meals. He hadn’t seen the faces of his family for several days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But why are you talking about the TV? What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Just something trivial... You can check it slowly later on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have something separate to do. Where’s Piaro’s house?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid questioned and Lauel and the Overgeared members guided him. Damian noticed that it wasn’t his turn yet and followed them silently</span>.</p>
