 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"There’s gold painted on his mouth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian was the biggest player in the pope candidates’ speech event.&nbsp;</span><span style>The other candidates criticized the factions, the Yatan Church, and showed their political colors, while Damian emphasized charity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By calling up the basic doctrines pursued by the Rebecca Church, it stimulated the nature of the clergy and reminded them of how wicked Pascal’s behavior was.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a speech technique based on Huroi’s teachings that if the audience’s attention was scattered, it was better to approach them indirectly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The effect was big.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal’s supporters stood indecisively as cracks showed, and some showed a small affinity for Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past two weeks, Huroi had thoroughly trained Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Pascal was scornful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Your ideals can never be realized. Most of the existing senior priests are already dirty because of Drevigo. Charity? Why are you so obsessed with that meaningless act?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What do you want to say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It means that flattering the junior priests are useless. The senior priests with the right to vote won’t agree with you. Your speech targeted the wrong people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian wasn’t upset at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That might be the case right now. However, it will change slowly. Most of the priests aren’t rotten to the core, unlike you. I will try my best to help the priests recover their past. Today is only the first step.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian’s atmosphere had changed significantly over the past two weeks.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was more proud and didn’t know fear.&nbsp;</span><span style>A firm belief was giving him confidence.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had unwavering eyes since Grid emerged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s unlucky.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was becoming more like that dirty Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal shrugged and said with a sigh.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Well, you might believe in Grid now, but that is just short-lived. Sooner or later, you will realize reality. I look forward to it. In a month, I will become pope and treat Rebecca’s Daughters harshly. You will be helpless and have to watch with despair.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel, standing next to Damian, flinched.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her past hell-like days surfaced when she saw Pascal’s snake eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>She felt the fear more strongly because she was at the crossroad of life and death just a few days ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian hid Isabel behind his back and declared,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Even if you are the pope, I will protect Isabel-chan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You still haven’t grasped things to the end. If you don’t have the strength, you should shut up and sit down. It’s providence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only the strong could reign, while the weak existed to be trampled on.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the value of the empire that conquered many colonies and turned the people into livestock.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Pascal became the pope, the Rebecca Church would be transformed into a religion that followed the interests of the empire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian covered the frightened Isabel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal laughed at them and left the room.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian shook his head and reassured Isabel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't worry. Isabel-chan will be happy. I will make it so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damian...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man’s pure and true heart started to reach the girl.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The elders’ meeting room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>23 elders were having a drinking party in a place that oversaw the divine affairs of the Rebecca Church.&nbsp;</span><span style>Some people had naked women beside them.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were prostitutes that Earl Chirita brought from the empire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal’s face twisted.&nbsp;</span><span style>"What are you doing? Have you forgotten how many people from all over the world are coming to see the Vatican today? You should be careful today when there are a lot of eyes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now, now. Don’t be so angry. Aren’t we in a secret place?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Chirita rose from his seat among the elders. He pulled Pascal down into a chair and smiled at him.&nbsp;</span><span style>“That guy called Grid, he should be dead by now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal suppressed his temper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isn’t it obvious? 19th Knight Fulito is capable of killing thousands of soldiers alone. As soon as Grid became his target, there was no room to escape, no matter what tricks he used.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no doubt.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Red Knights might be less than the ones of the previous generation, but the power of the knights in the 10’s was absolute. They couldn’t be defeated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let’s drink to my son, he will become the father of 80 millions members in a month.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal received Earl Chirita’s drink.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were father and son, but their behavior was quite natural.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hrmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was an eyesore.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t help feeling pleasure at the thought of Grid being dead.&nbsp;</span><span style>It seemed like new hair would grow out from his bald patches.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am finally free from that damn hair loss.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal was feeling invigorated over the glass of alcohol when the door burst open.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was it Fulito returning after his mission?&nbsp;</span><span style>Everybody thought so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuak!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ku tang tang tang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Someone crossed the door without permission. &nbsp;No, one of Earl Chirita’s knights came flying.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was one of the six knights guarding the entrance.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was already dying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“R-Run away.”&nbsp;</span><span style>The knight stuttered.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was frightened. It was like he had witnessed the grim reaper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Run away?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the meeting room of the elders.&nbsp;</span><span style>As one of the most sacred places in the Vatican, its safety was guaranteed for hundreds of years.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the final stronghold that people escaped to, not run away from!&nbsp;</span><span style>So what was this person saying now?</span></p>
 <p><span style>A drunk elder rose from his seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who dares intrude on this sacred place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this a sacred place? I thought it was a rotten place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then a sarcastic voice was heard from behind the door.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Step step.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The steps came closer.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was someone that nobody expected.&nbsp;</span><span style>The identity of the intruder...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“G-Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unbelievable!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal and the elders looked like they were seeing ghosts.&nbsp;</span><span style>Wasn’t Grid supposed to be killed by the Red Knights and Black Knights!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It can’t be!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A chill went down Pascal’s spine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid defeated the 19th knight?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the confusion spread, Grid looked over at the prostitutes. There were some women with large breasts, and usually his gaze would be fixed on them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Grid was convinced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Goddess Rebecca is wrong.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They broke the doctrines and committed wicked acts, but they still had divine power as long as they sincerely believed in her?&nbsp;</span><span style>She was a very narrow-minded and careless goddess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No, the goddess might just be pure.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The problem was with those who abused the purity of the goddess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Whatever, it doesn’t matter to me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now there was only one thing Grid wanted.&nbsp;</span><span style>"All of you will die here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal and the elders flinched with fright.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid grinned at them with a hard expression in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Didn’t I tell you? I’m in a different position from Damian, so I can deal with you as I like. This is the truth, but thank you for aiming at me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal and the elders turned red. The system recognized that they had sent the Red Knights and Black Knights as assassins.&nbsp;</span><span style>Therefore, he could attack them without fearing the Goddess’ Curse.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Chirita yelled at the grinning Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You dumb bastard! Don’t you know who I am? Who are you to come her and say such random things?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to his son, Earl Chirita had lost his sense of reason.&nbsp;</span><span style>He thought that everything would always go his way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What are you doing? Go and kill him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He ordered the wounded knights.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were going to die anyway.&nbsp;</span><span style>The knights of Earl Chirita rose up again. Then they immediately struck at Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>They didn’t feel fighting spirit, or the will to live.&nbsp;</span><span style>They only felt fear.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, they weren’t in the 200’s yet and couldn’t be Grid’s opponent.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The biggest advantage of a greatsword was its destructive power.&nbsp;</span><span style>The superb sword cut the knights to pieces.&nbsp;</span><span style>The blood of the knights scattered all over the table filled with delicacies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kyaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The prostitutes and Earl Chirita fell back down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“R-Really... He is stronger than Fulito...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Chirita muttered blankly, while Pascal tried to calm Grid down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Duke Grid, what happened that made you in such a rage? First of all, let’s settle down and talk out the misunderstanding.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, Pascal was a real trickster.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this moment, his acting was really natural.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid snorted.&nbsp;</span><span style>“What should we speak about when you sent the Red Knights and Black Knights to assassinate me? Just stay silent and die."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal angrily denied it.&nbsp;</span><span style>"No, was there such a thing? I don’t know anything about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Stop acting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah!”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t believe him, so Pascal glanced towards Earl Chirita.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Earl Chirita, was it you? Did you send assassins to kill Duke Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This guy was trying to sell out his own father?&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Chirita received a big shock and was speechless.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal whispered to him,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Sacrifice yourself. I am the one who is going to be the pope.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Pascal...! How can you do this to your father?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal’s expression became angry as he gazed at Earl Chirita.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Over the past decades, you were able to become a favored lord thanks to me. Haven’t I done my best as your child? On the other hand, what about you? Have you done anything for me as my father?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“P-Pascal...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You should be a father once before you die. Isn't that right?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“U-Ugh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Chirita finally shed tears.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t due to fear of Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was shocked and sad when he was treated as insignificant by his son, who was his only pride.&nbsp;</span><span style>As he bowed his head and sobbed, Pascal grinned towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, it’s like this. Earl Chirita seems to have done something foolish. Now Duke Grid. Pour your wrath towards the earl and receive my glass of alcohol...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Crazy bastard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fundamental reason why Grid hated Pascal was because he was the type to trample on the weak.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was in a bad mood whenever he saw Pascal, because he was reminded of the people who taunted and bothered him in the past.&nbsp;</span><span style>But at this moment, Grid found another reason to hate Pascal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unfilial bastard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was born and grew up in the East.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was a filial son who gave the chicken legs to his parents whenever they ate chicken.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal sacrificing his father was unacceptable, causing Grid to feel extreme hatred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t try these tricks on me. In any case, I am the only one who can leave here alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid clearly changed as he equipped the mask and eye patch.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal was threatened by the red light and shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Quit being stupid! The Saharan Empire will punish you if you touch its ambassadors! Aren’t you afraid of them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Of course I’m afraid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t become the enemy of the Saharan Empire just yet.&nbsp;</span><span style>Reidan would be crushed in half a day if it had to face the power of the empire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So I have to kill all of you. The fact that I killed the Red Knights and Black Knights can’t be passed onto the empire.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You should be worried! Even if you kill us, things would go out of control! Do you think there is no one who witnessed you heading here? You will die after being pinpointed as the criminal, and Damian won’t become pope since he has ties with you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There’s no need to worry about that. ‘I’ am currently chatting with the church members in the Vatican’s gardens.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doppelganger Randy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have the perfect alibi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don't know what you’re talking about!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It doesn’t matter. You will die soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s killing intent thickened.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal realized the battle was unavoidable and shouted to the elders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We can endure if we use buffs and heals! The paladins will rush over once the turmoil grows!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal’s divine power was currently close to former pope Drevigo. It was truly great to have pope level divine power despite not being crowned pope yet.&nbsp;</span><span style>What if Pascal and the 23 elders decided to join forces?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘We won’t die!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as they weren’t killed by a single blow, they could continue to heal each other.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a fairly rational thinking.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the problem was that the opponent was Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Divine power and black magic power were the antithesis of each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blackening.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your black magic power has increased.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You don’t have any black magic power. It will be replaced with demonic power.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[While Blackening is activated, your species will change to half-demon.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[As a half demon, your maximum health is reduced by 50%. Your attack power, magic power and agility will increased by 20% each.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[All attacks will be converted to the black magic attribute.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blackening.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>This was a skill that belonged to the legendary rated accessory, ‘Dark Bus’ Earrings.’ It had good compatibility with Grid, who possessed demonic power.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sururuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>His skin became pale white and there were no whites in his eyes, as it became entirely black.&nbsp;</span><span style>The black hair fluttering with demonic energy made him look ominous.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s current appearance wasn’t much different from the demons imagined by humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Transcended Link.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A berserk demonic power filled the room.&nbsp;</span><span style>The elders’ meeting room was filled with fear.</span></p>
