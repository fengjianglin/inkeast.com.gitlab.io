 <p><span style>Chapter 387</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[You have entered the 20th island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The time it took Grid to pass 19 islands and reach the 20th island was exactly 45 hours and 19 minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style>He broke through the treasure hunt mission with a versatile key and avoided the thunderstorm with a giant lightning rod. These missions wasted a lot of time for ordinary contestants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the same with the Overgeared members.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members were prepared due to Grid who had reached the 40th island.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were able to enter the 20th island as fast as Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The mission of the 20th island is to avoid the eyes of the hell moon.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members thought of the method that Grid came up with.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sururuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>They used the invisibility cloak and hid their traces on the island.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to that, the hell moon couldn’t do anything.&nbsp;</span><span style>All of this was thanks to Grid.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>39 days remained until the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 1st ranked Kraugel stood at the crossroad of choice.&nbsp;</span><span style>For the remaining period of time, he could re-challenge the Behen Archipelago or re-challenge Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can acquire skills and elixirs in the Behen Archipelago.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he won against Piaro, he could change to a legendary class.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even if he only succeeded in one of the options, Kraugel could play an overwhelming role in the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Both are likely to fail.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could he challenge Piaro and win?&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel calculated that the odds were only 30%.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then what about the Behen Archipelago?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The probability of clearing the Behen Archipelago is even lower.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason why Kraugel couldn’t re-challenge the Behen Archipelago was the nonsensical 31st island.&nbsp;</span><span style>The 31st island recreated his past trials.&nbsp;</span><span style>There, Kraugel had to fight the great demon Furfu. It was in a state where his level was lower than 180.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Furfu...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the great demons who lost to Sword Saint Muller.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past, Kraugel had dismissed Furfu.&nbsp;</span><span style>A great demon who lost his body. Kraugel was confident that he could raid Furfu by himself, despite Furfu borrowing the body of an intermediate demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The result?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was terrible.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had been killed three times in succession, with Furfu chasing him to the ends of the world. If he hadn’t received help, he might’ve died a few more times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The Behen Archipelago isn’t a place I can clear with my abilities.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel’s expression was bitter as he made this judgment.&nbsp;</span><span style>He compared himself with Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid, the first player who defeated him.&nbsp;</span><span style>He said he passed the 30th island.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was a man with the amazing ability to overcome past trials.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Hrmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel thought this and turned his attention to the East Continent.&nbsp;</span><span style>He could gain exclusive White Swordsman items, exclusive skills and rapid level increase from the East Continent.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were many rewards that were less valuable than the Behen Archipelago or Piaro, but they couldn’t be ignored.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to stay on the East Continent until the National Competition.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel made his decision and used the East Continent’s portal scroll.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“This is very hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 41st island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid studied the combination of Linked Kill Wave and Pinnacle Kill in three days of game time, but didn’t achieve the desired result.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t easy to catch the timing if Linked Kill Wave and Pinnacle Kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is absurd.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He tried from 0.1 seconds to 3 seconds to connect Link and Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style>But rather than Linked Kill Wave, only Link or Linked Kill were activated, making Grid go crazy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I’ve been doing this for three days already...’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that he couldn’t get the results he wanted despite doing his best was irritating him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s head hurt.&nbsp;</span><span style>He once again lamented his low talents.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he wasn’t frustrated.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid still had hope.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Perhaps it isn’t the gap between Link and Kill, but the fulfillment of other conditions.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could he figure out what conditions there were?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will fight my clone one more time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid knew better than anyone that he couldn’t win against his clone in his current state.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid wasn’t afraid.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he was afraid of failure, he would become stagnant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do it again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid breathed in deeply and moved through the gate of the 41st island.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would once again fight with the clone, while taking note of the process for Linked Kill Wave and Pinnacle Kill.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[You have entered the 41st island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A mission will be created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[41st Island]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fight with yourself and win.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First Clear Compensation: You can raise the level of one skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A flat island with no geographical features.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment Grid stepped onto the small island, the clone came forward to meet him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, it was the same as three days ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s clone attacked the moment Grid entered the island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Will he open with Linked Kill Wave again?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid focused.&nbsp;</span><span style>He watched the movements of the clone without blinking in order to figure out the secret behind Linked Kill Wave.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the skill was used.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Transcended Link.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dammit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It used Transcended Link instead of the skill Grid wanted?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid also used Transcended Link, as dozens of energy blades were fired.&nbsp;</span><span style>The bombardment caused the earth to shake.&nbsp;</span><span style>The impact was enormous as it was a clash between legendary skills.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuaaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The swirling sandstorm disturbed Grid’s visibility and he retreated backwards, while the clone made another choice.&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite the pain of the sand getting into the eyes, the clone persevered as he rushed forward and swung Iyarugt at Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was immediately after using Transcended Link and Grid was still armed with Grid’s Greatsword, so he couldn’t read Iyarugt’s orbit.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s thigh was cut.&nbsp;</span><span style>He belatedly swapped to Iyarugt, but...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clone swapped from Iyarugt back to Grid’s Greatsword, and used a skill, hitting Grid successively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Why is his weapons swapping speed so quick?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weapon swapping required a series of processes.&nbsp;</span><span style>It required opening the inventory, putting in the item then bringing out the desired item.&nbsp;</span><span style>In Grid’s case, the process took around 2 seconds on average.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was confused because the clone did it in less than a second.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Will I get used to it if I do it often?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid suppressed the confusion and thought as positively as possible while wielding Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was necessary to deal as much damage as possible while the clone was armed with Grid’s Greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Iyarugt stabbed at the clone’s side, leaving a blood-like glow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to continue this momentum.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t use a skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>He quickly wielded Iyarugt, not giving the clone a chance to use skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was clearly an effective choice.&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone was forced to concentrate on defense.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Chaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The battle entered a lull.&nbsp;</span><span style>Iyarugt and Iyarugt collided with each other, leaving a bloody afterglow in the area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Let’s think about it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could he shake off the clone in order to use a skill and change the shape of the battle?&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone extended a finger while Grid was thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Magic Missile."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Magic Missile (Enhanced)’s casting time was only one second.&nbsp;</span><span style>It required one finger to be extended, so it was possible to cast while wielding a sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid also knew this, but the one who changed the battlefield using Magic Missile was the clone.&nbsp;</span><span style>It proved that the clone’s thinking ability was better than Grid’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid winced as he was hit by Magic Missile.&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone swapped to Grid’s Greatsword in an instant and carried out the footwork of Link.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid also wanted to offset it by using Link the same way, but the problem was that it took time to swap to Grid’s Greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Grid’s Greatsword was pulled out, the clone’s Link was already complete.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Shit.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid gritted his teeth.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was to prepare for the pain.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the pain didn’t come.&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone was still continuing its sword dance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Link and then Kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Linked Kill!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was lucky.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He wouldn’t have been able to cope if Link was immediately used, but he was given time.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Taack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid hurriedly pulled out the Divine Shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clone combined Linked Kill with Wave.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Linked Kill Wave.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kurururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Subsequently, waves of Kill attacks filled the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I understand!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid gained enlightenment.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to combine Linked Kill Wave, it was essential to withdraw back before connecting each sword technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Finally, I also...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid watched carefully.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it wasn’t a situation where he could just sit back and enjoy.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>8 Kill attacks were directly aimed at Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid summoned Randy and had him use Revolve.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The 8 Kills were sucked in by Revolve and turned around, heading back to the clone.&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone remained calm.&nbsp;</span><span style>He also summoned Randy and responded by using Revolve.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the meantime, Grid was completely aware the movements of Link and Kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He calculated the time accurately and didn’t forget to step backwards before connecting Link and Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he started on the sword dance for Wave.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A powerful energy centred on Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the energy of Linked Kill Wave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Okay!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was filled with joy.&nbsp;</span><span style>After two Revolves, the more powerful Kill attacks headed towards him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuaaaaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There was an explosion and the earth shook.&nbsp;</span><span style>Did Grid receive catastrophic damage?&nbsp;</span><span style>He succeeded in Linked Kill Wave, but couldn’t even use it?&nbsp;</span><span style>No, that wasn’t it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid wasn’t in a crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Linked Kill Wave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>By changing his position with Randy, he was able to appear at the side of the clone and unfold the best skill.</span></p>
