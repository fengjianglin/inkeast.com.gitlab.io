 <p><span style>Chapter 2</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘This bastard!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I wanted to stab my sword in Ashur’s mouth right now, but it was an impossible task.&nbsp;</span><span style>The man’s level was 300 and was also a great magician who completed his third class change. His escort knights had an average of level 180.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, I was only at level 73 and didn’t even have a chance against the youngest knight who was serving as a bread shuttle. (Bread shuttle - Usually used at school, where one student is picked on and/or bullied to do the errands for people who are higher on the social ladder than the shuttles are.)</span></p>
 <p><span style>But look at the quest clear conditions.&nbsp;</span><span style>I had to kill them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Plus!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Even if I cleared the quest, wasn’t the quest compensation garbage?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘My intelligence will be minus 50? Fuck, right now I have 30 intelligence, so won’t I be an idiot if I’m at minus 50? And all of the kingdom’s nobles would hate me? So where was my exit route?? Why is there a quest like this? Ahhh!!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was only one choice.&nbsp;</span><span style>Just die.&nbsp;</span><span style>I would drop two levels, but I couldn’t succeed anyway. Besides, what was the point of succeeding with such a nasty quest?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hu...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I felt resigned.&nbsp;</span><span style>The pressure from the knights wasn’t a joke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This means I would’ve lost eight levels just from this quest... Ashur... One day, I will become high level and take revenge. Definitely.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I stared at Ashur and vowed revenge, then closed my eyes at the menacing swords in the knights’ hands. Then suddenly, I remembered Pagma’s book in my hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Wait, what about this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would it remain in my inventory after I died if I put it in there before my death?&nbsp;</span><span style>This wasn’t a general quest item, so I couldn’t be assured of the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was Ashur’s purpose in the first place?&nbsp;</span><span style>Pagma’s rare book.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reason he wanted to kill me was to take it away.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order for the story to go smoothly, if he killed me, it was likely that Pagma’s book would disappear from my inventory and fall into his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If I was going to lose Pagma’s book anyway, I might as well use it instead of selling!&nbsp;</span><span style>A new option emerged.&nbsp;</span><span style>I could use Pagma’s rare book.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, I hesitated. I hated production-related classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Wasn’t the point of a game to enjoy the thrill of battle?&nbsp;</span><span style>However, if I became a blacksmith, I would have to sweat as I hammered at iron in front of a fire. It might be necessary to carry pickaxes while searching for mines to collect the necessary materials.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was indeed...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘La. bor.’ &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a chill went down my spine.&nbsp;</span><span style>I was doing brickwork and shovel work at construction sites in real life, and now I needed to do labor in a game as well!&nbsp;</span><span style>Just imagining it made me feel terribly dizzy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuock...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I wanted to remain as a warrior; it was my dream to swing my sword at enemies and someday become an army general.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now it was time to give up on that dream.&nbsp;</span><span style>An item worth hundreds of millions of won would be taken away by an NPC! By that bastard Ashur!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s better to use it than to lose it to him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I tearfully opened Pagma’s book.&nbsp;</span><span style>The shocked Ashur hurriedly stretched out a hand and chanted a spell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s too late, you jerk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I ridiculed him before falling silent as I checked the notification windows appearing one by one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have become Pagma’s descendant.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your level has dropped.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You are now level 1.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[All skills and stats have been reset.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I couldn’t believe my eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Weren’t class changes supposed to help you get stronger by strengthening your existing level, stats, and skills?&nbsp;</span><span style>Therefore, I couldn’t understand why my level, stats and skills were reset instead of maintained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As I was confused by the unknown situation, new notification windows emerged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Dexterity stat has opened.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship skill has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship skill has been mastered.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Blacksmith’s Appraisal skill has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Blacksmith’s Appraisal skill has been mastered.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Blacksmith’s Patience has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Blacksmith’s Patience has been mastered.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Blacksmith’s Disassembly skill has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Blacksmith’s Disassembly skill has been mastered.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Blacksmith’s Repair skill has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Blacksmith’s Repair skill has been mastered.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[All blacksmith skills have been mastered to the level of the Pinnacle and the skills of the legendary blacksmith have been opened.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship skill has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Discernment skill has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Appraisal skill has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Patience skill has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Repair skill has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Disassembly skill has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath skill has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Blessing skill has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation skill has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Title, ‘One who Became a Legend’, has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Composure stat has opened.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Indomitable stat has opened.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Dignity stat has opened.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Insight stat has opened.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the case of dexterity, it was a basic stat possessed by all users with a production-related class.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the Composure, Indomitable, Dignity, and Insight stats were all unfamiliar.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was this a good thing?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Not good!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was desperate.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were 15 passive skills and 22 active skills that I learned as a warrior.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, I completely lost all my abilities as a warrior. Due to the effect of the class change, I had completely become a laborer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, I was level one.&nbsp;</span><span style>The levels that I barely built up over the past year had been completely reset and I needed to start over? I had to restart the damn level-up grind from the beginning?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is there a quest like this? Fuc*<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a382e3">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>….~#@…<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="86a8a2c6">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>….^%$!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I combined several Korean characters together as a knight’s sword rapidly headed towards me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have been hit by a blow!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have died.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The level 1’s low stamina dropped to 0 with a single hit from a level 180 knight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Quest failed!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You will no longer be able to enter Patrian.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Any Patrian soldiers will kill you on sight.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your level has dropped by 2.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You are now level -1.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[There is no registered residence. Do you want to resurrect at the nearest temple?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I saw my level and lost it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Negative? My level is negative??”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was certain that I had been cursed by the gods for some fault in a previous life.&nbsp;</span><span style>I barely got here after three months of hardship only to get this result?&nbsp;</span><span style>I didn’t want to play the game.&nbsp;</span><span style>I chose to log out instead of resurrecting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once I quit the game, I immediately connected to the Internet and searched through all of the Satisfy related forums in Korea to look for information about a negative level.&nbsp;</span><span style>But I couldn’t get any information so I wrote my question directly on the forum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: I am currently level -1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Contents: I have been doing a quest for three months and received a legendary old book. However, I failed and my level strangely dropped to -1. Why??? Has this ever happened before???????&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>I pressed the OK button to post and completely emerged from the capsule.&nbsp;</span><span style>A quick glance in the mirror revealed someone who looked like an emaciated patient with an incurable disease. It was the aftermath of not sleeping for three months while doing the quest.&nbsp;</span><span style>And the only thing I received in return was a loss of hundreds of millions of won and a minus level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My three months of work have gone flying away... Three months of hard work. Hahaha...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I could’ve gone and taken some labor jobs, but I ended up shoveling air.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>No, it was a loss of time and level.&nbsp;</span><span style>I lost energy and flopped to the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>I was sad, empty, grumpy, and resentful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>All types of negative emotions were pouring in, giving me a tremendous sense of helplessness.&nbsp;</span><span style>If I were weaker person, I was sure that I would’ve committed suicide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...I need to take a shit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I had been connected to the game for a long time, so I headed to the bathroom after receiving a physiological signal.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was three in the morning.&nbsp;</span><span style>All my family members were sleeping. If I woke up my parents then they might curse at me.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>I stealthily crossed the living room, quietly did my business in the bathroom, washed up, moved back to the kitchen, and took out a side dish from the fridge.&nbsp;</span><span style>I barely managed to find a spoon in the darkness and returned to my room with a bowl of rice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh, it’s sausage fried rice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The taste of a meat processed product!&nbsp;</span><span style>As I ate delicious food and filled up my stomach, I relaxed and could think soberly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How did my level become minus?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I thought about it before sitting in the capsule to check the question I posted on the Internet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the meantime, the number of views on my posts had gone over 10,000.&nbsp;</span><span style>The number of comments was more than 2,000!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“D-Don’t tell me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I couldn’t find the information, but was the minus level actually famous among users, and the users were excited because it gave tremendous benefits?&nbsp;</span><span style>My dream was destroyed when I checked the comments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iksl ** 's answer: If there is a minus level, a ghost will appear before me at night.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eksk ** s answer: Wow ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ I am level -5 ^.^</span><span style>We are low-level comrades.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tutu ** 's answer: Did you find a legendary book as well? ㅋㅋ Do you have an attention sickness?</span></p>
 <p><span style>cm3s **’s answer: He should be brought to a mental hospital. Take this post down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>7r14 ** s answer: Legendary book... minus level... these days ㄸㄹㅇ really, some people...</span></p>
 <p><span style>jk12 **-1’s answer: Wouldn’t -1 be last place in the rankings ㅋㅋㅋㅋ I would quit the gameㅋ</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kkks ** 's answer: Something this unique that hasn’t appeared yet, what nonsense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qkr8 ** s answer: Is it excessive drinking?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gjte ** s answer: Wow, minus level... I pay homage to your imagination. You should be a fiction writer. ㄷ ㄷ&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were 2,000 comments like these. I felt like an idiot.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It seems that information about minus level hasn’t been revealed at all... am I the first person?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy’s system was configured to allow users to discover and develop themselves. There was no such thing as a customer service center like in other more traditional online games.&nbsp;</span><span style>Satisfy’s two billion users had been developing the world during the past year by pioneering and exchanging information on their own.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But in such a vast world, there was a lot of information that hadn’t been revealed, such as the minus level that I was experiencing now.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Swaaah.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was raining outside the window. According to the weather forecast, it was going to rain all day. It wasn’t easy to get a labor job if he went out looking today.&nbsp;</span><span style>I ate the last of the rice and logged into the game again.</span></p>
