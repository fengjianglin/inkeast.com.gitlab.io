 <p><span style>Chapter 55</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>I didn’t leave the smithy for the entirety of last month.&nbsp;</span><span style>From the moment I connected to Satisfy to the time I logged out, I stayed at the smithy the whole time.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the meantime, I was able to establish some facts that I knew dimly or discovered new facts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First, making the same items repeatedly wasn’t effective in raising the skill experience. Every time I made a different item, the skill experience would rise at a good rate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Secondly, the better the materials, the higher the possibility that the item would have a higher rating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For example, when making two iron swords based on the same production method, the iron sword with the poor-quality metal had a close to 100% chance of being a normal rating, whereas the one made with the finest metal had a relatively high probability of receiving a rare rating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thirdly, even when I was making items with the same production method and materials, the ones that I spent longer on were the ones that were more likely to have a higher rating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very fortunate that I managed to make a unique dagger in only three hours. I had to invest at least half an hour if I wanted to make an item higher than a rare rating.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, the number of items that could be produced in one day was very limited, so increasing my stats wasn’t as easy of a feat as I thought it would be.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fourthly, if I wanted to be a good blacksmith, I had to invest points in stamina, as well as in strength and in dexterity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The equipment and minerals used in a smithy were mostly heavy, so I needed high strength to work efficiently. When making an item, I needed to have a lot of stamina if I didn’t want to become exhausted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So I really liked my high strength and stamina stat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Pant pant...aren’t you still young? You can’t be exhausted yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike Khan who took a break every time an item was completed, I was able to produce items constantly without taking a break when I was connected to Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past month, I created 73 items, meaning I produced an average of two or more items a day.&nbsp;</span><span style>11 of the 73 items had a rare rating and 3 of the 73 had an epic rating. As a result, all of my stats increased by 34 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I currently had 11 types of stats: strength, stamina, agility, intelligence, dexterity, persistence, composure, indomitable, dignity, insight and courage.&nbsp;</span><span style>If 11 stats increased by 34 points each, this meant it was increased by 374 points, which was equivalent to gaining 37 levels.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But I was dissatisfied.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why?&nbsp;</span><span style>I made 73 items. I invested at least six hours every time I made an item. The materials were also as good as possible within my range.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, I never made one unique rated item, let alone a legendary one.&nbsp;</span><span style>Wasn’t this too much?</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I only got three epic rated items... Crazy. Is this a legendary blacksmith? Ah, I’m so tired.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every time I made an item, I earnestly prayed for a unique rating. However, it was almost always a normal rating. Every time, I felt an incredible sense of disappointment and wanted to curse at the game.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only comfort was that the level of my production skills increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lv. 2</span></p>
 <p><span style>Produce equipment items that you know how to make.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You can create the production methods for a new item with the ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There is a certain probability of producing rare~ epic rated items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There is a rare probability of creating unique rated items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There is a very rare probability of creating legendary rated items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All stats of a production item will increase by 12%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* When rare rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +2 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +30.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* When epic rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +4 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +80.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* When unique rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +12 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +300.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* When legendary rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +25 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +1,000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Something special will occur with every five legendary items created.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation Skill]</span></p>
 <p><span style>You can create three equipment item production methods every time the skill level of the ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill’ goes up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number of items that can be created at present: 5/6.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* When items are produced using this skill, the name of the creator is automatically placed on the item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lv. 2</span></p>
 <p><span style>When you are concentrating on making an item, the will of Pagma’s Descendant will fill the production item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All stats of a production item will increase by 7%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There is a rare chance of giving special features to your production items.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&nbsp;In addition to the increase in my skill levels, there was something else that was gratifying.&nbsp;</span><span style>I had created dozens of items in Khan’s smithy over the past month.&nbsp;</span><span style>Khan wanted to pass on as much knowledge to me as possible before he retired, so I was given one new production method every day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was an enormous harvest. The original method of acquiring production items was to perform specific quests, and the level of difficulty varied.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thus, it was very difficult to find item production methods. I was fortunate enough to acquire many production methods without the need for separate quests, thanks to being Khan’s successor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I pulled out a book from my inventory. The title was ‘List of Items Production Methods.’ The book described the details of the production methods I learned.&nbsp;</span><span style>The table of contents had expanded.&nbsp;</span><span style>Starting from my own ‘Failure’ to the Jaffa Arrows I learned in Bairan, to the dozens of works acquired from Khan...</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was exciting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘When I was in Bairan Village, I had only four production methods, including the axe, pickaxe, Jaffa Arrow and Failure...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When I looked at the production methods, Euphemina entered my mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why hasn’t that woman come with the method to create the orb?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina wanted me to make an orb for her.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s why it was highly likely that she would bring the best production method.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then I would be able to get my hands on a production method for free.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was happy just imagining it.&nbsp;</span><span style>No, wait...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If...if there is only one chance... what if Euphemina brings me the production method and materials, only for me to make a normal-rated orb?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would she take my life?&nbsp;</span><span style>Maybe Euphemina would keep me locked up somewhere until I managed to complete a unique rated orb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it is her...”&nbsp;</span><span style>I recalled the psychotic smile on Euphemina’s face as she burned the lord’s bodyguards.&nbsp;</span><span style>“...What will she do to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I no longer waited for Euphemina.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rather, I wished that she would never show up.&nbsp;</span><span style>I shook with terror. Then the door of the smithy opened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hiik! E-Euphemina?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was an old saying that a tiger would come when mentioned. It felt like Euphemina had been waiting for me to mention her.&nbsp;</span><span style>Fortunately, the people who arrived at the smithy wasn’t Euphemina. At first glance, they looked like two incredibly high-level male users.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this Khan’s smithy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I am Khan... why are you looking for me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They started questioning Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style>"You competed in the item production game with a traveller called Erina a month ago right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is she really a blacksmith? Did you witness her making the item with your own eyes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The question is strange. Is she a blacksmith? Of course she is a blacksmith. She was hired by the Mero Company to participate in the game and I have directly experienced her great blacksmith skills. No, who on earth are you? Why are you asking such strange questions?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The men disregarded Khan’s question and talked among themselves. Then they asked Khan again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is the Mero Company the only organization involved in the item production game? Is there any chance of other organizations being involved?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Displeasure appeared on Khan’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had been friendly because they were young boys of a similar age to his son, but they ignored his questions and only cared about themselves.&nbsp;</span><span style>The men didn’t care at all about Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rather, they began to talk over Khan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why aren’t you answering? If you know anything, shouldn’t you tell me? It is better if you don’t waste our time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was like a threat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How funny.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was Khan’s smithy. These people were guests. They weren’t in the position to question Khan. Then what was with their attitude?</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were talking down to Khan, who was similar to their grandfathers.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were ignoring Khan because he was an NPC. In fact, this wasn’t unusual among users.&nbsp;</span><span style>Certainly, NPCs weren’t human. They were just part of the system program, artificial intelligences.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But I knew.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite being artificially made, Khan had his own memories and feelings.&nbsp;</span><span style>He could feel anger and hopelessness. He could cry when sad and laugh when happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He was someone I could count on.&nbsp;</span><span style>And sometimes he missed his dead son.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So I was angry at those who treated Khan casually.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Hey, you over there, what is with your attitude? What right do you have to threaten Khan? Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They looked me up and down and laughed as they saw my dirty clothes and old blacksmith hammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is this? When did he get here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What? Why were they speaking impolitely when I wasn’t an NPC?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When did I get here? I am obviously an employee here. Why are you so arrogant when entering someone else’s business? Huh? Is this your business?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Arrogant? Don’t make me laugh. We just want cooperation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that the attitude of someone seeking cooperation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hah... should we have visited with orange juice?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I really hated people like this. Looking at their equipment, they seemed to be rankers close to level 200. However, I couldn’t help being honest when seeing their expressions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His companion started mediation.&nbsp;</span><span style>"You shouldn’t get so heated up against a beginner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sigh, okay. I have to calm down. Damn, my nerves are irritated after Faker was attacked. Hey, beginner blacksmith, we are looking for the woman. We are in a hurry to find her so we were inadvertently rude to the NPC. It was a mistake. &nbsp;I’m sorry. Is it okay now? So please move out of the way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You should apologize to Khan, not me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They started ignoring me. They asked Khan once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Khan, answer me. Do you know if Erina is associated with any organizations besides the Mero Company?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was he worried that I would get hurt?&nbsp;</span><span style>Khan hid me behind his back and replied.&nbsp;</span></p>
