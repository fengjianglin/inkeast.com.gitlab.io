 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Scale armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the name suggested, it was armor similar to the scales of a fish.&nbsp;</span><span style>Several small pieces of iron plates were put on leather straps and then joined together with thick cloth or leather.&nbsp;</span><span style>The range of activity was high because it allowed free movements of the body. In addition, it was good at deflecting swords and other sharp weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style>It had resistance to stabbing and slashing as options.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the basic defense power was inferior when compared to other heavy armor.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, it was difficult to avoid a fatal injury if the joints where the iron plates were joined together were attacked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In the end, the gap between iron plates is the biggest problem.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s why tankers hardly wore scale armor, despite it being classified as heavy armor.&nbsp;</span><span style>The scale armor had obvious advantages, but there were also obvious limitations.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid thought of a way to overcome the limitations of scale armor.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was thanks to the hint from the troll lord’s breastplate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I make multiple layers of iron plates, I can maintain the advantages of scale armor while covering the deficient defense.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Typical scale armor was one layer of joined iron plates. The moment the weapon struck between the plates, the defense was forced to fail.&nbsp;</span><span style>The troll lord’s breastplate minimized this weakness with a double layer of iron plates.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was it possible that blacksmiths had never thought of this idea?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>No.&nbsp;</span><span style>Existing blacksmiths also knew that multiple layers of iron plates would increase the defense.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reason why they didn’t make it...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The higher the iron content, the higher the weight and the more limited the movements.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, it lost the advantages inherent to scale armor.&nbsp;</span><span style>Heavy and movement-limiting scale armor?&nbsp;</span><span style>Who would want to use it? If it was going to be inconvenient anyway, they might as well wear heavy armor with much higher defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But the items I make are different.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black iron was two times harder and three times lighter than iron.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can use this to make the plates as thinly as possible.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would make scale armor that was light and easy to move in, even if the iron plates were doubled or tripled.&nbsp;</span><span style>This wasn't an easy task.&nbsp;</span><span style>Black iron smelting was seven times more difficult than iron smelting.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even Khan, whose blacksmith skill was advanced level 8, wouldn’t be able to smelt black iron so thinly and shape hundreds of scales.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Grid was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s blacksmith skill was legendary level 7 and his dexterity was close to 3,000.&nbsp;</span><span style>For him, smelting black iron was just as hard as ordinary blacksmiths smelting iron.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’ll prove why I’m a legend.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to other legends, it was true that he was lacking many things when it came to combat. However, as a blacksmith, he could proudly say that he was the best.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The taste of holding minerals in his hands was the best. The pleasure was greater compared to when killing monsters.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s concentration rose rapidly as he started hitting the black iron on the anvil.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The width of the iron plate shouldn’t be too wide.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>The joints between the iron plates increased the flexibility of the scale armor. Grid wanted the iron plates to have a narrow width, in order to maximize the characteristics.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the smaller the plates, the longer the working time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In particular, the number of iron plates increased because he needed to make three layers.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was impossible to make hundreds of small iron plates and join them together, even if it took two full days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Grid was a craftsman.&nbsp;</span><span style>The increasing workload?&nbsp;</span><span style>It didn’t matter.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was necessary if he wanted to make better items.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Small and thin black iron pieces were refined in Grid’s hands.&nbsp;</span><span style>The appearance, size, and shine reminded him of black dragon scales.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Beautiful scales.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The scales are at least three times smaller than the scales of typical scale armor, but the details are much better. The technique of the duke is really delicate.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Wow... It seems like he has made over 100 already? How many is the duke planning to make?'</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This would be incredibly boring and difficult work for me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan and the young blacksmiths were amazed at Grid’s workmanship and care.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Patience skill has been activated.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Concentration, stamina and defense will rise to the extremes for one hour.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath skill has been activated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Breath has increased the effectiveness of your production items]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The roosters cried out at dawn.&nbsp;</span><span style>Beyond the blacksmith’s window, the spires of the castle rose in the distance. However, Grid didn’t take a break.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid relied on his high stamina to continue making the iron plates.&nbsp;</span><span style>He devoted himself to work, despite the day passing and it becoming night again. Excluding meal time and sleeping time, he never released his hammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then two days later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have successfully made the ‘Scale Armor.’]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The structure is different from the ‘Scale Armor’ on your production list.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Analyzing the scale armor.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The function of your scale armor is phenomenal.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Scale Armor (Enhanced)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Scale armor modified by the legendary blacksmith Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike conventional scale armor, it has a triple layer of iron plates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black iron is used to minimize the weight, and 621 iron plates were made as small as possible in order to increase the range of movement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Scale Armor (Enhanced)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Scale armor modified by the legendary blacksmith Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid felt a sense of deja vu from these words.&nbsp;</span><span style>At first, he couldn’t think of anything, but then he remembered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Magic Missile (Enhanced)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A magic missile developed by the legendary great magician who has completely overturned the activation formula.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, it was Braham’s magic.&nbsp;</span><span style>Just as Braham strengthened existing magic, Grid was able to strengthen existing items.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this moment, Grid was able to truly understand why he was a legendary blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Please decide the name of the item you have created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The system asked before listing the item’s ratings and options.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Um.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid thought carefully and came to a conclusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I made three layers of iron plates.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It matched well with the three-layered meat that Koreans were familiar with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let’s call it Three Layers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the worst.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel would’ve tried anything to stop Grid if he was present.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unfortunately, Lauel wasn’t here.&nbsp;</span><span style>For the sake of Reidan’s future, Lauel was busy interacting with female NPCs and didn’t care about Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was really a pity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Have you decided on ‘Three Layers?’]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[’Three Layers’ has been added to the list of item production methods!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Three Layers has been completed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Three Layers]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Legendary</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 721/721 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 1,115</span></p>
 <p><span style>* 30% reduction in damage from physical attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* 50% reduction in damage from stabbing attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Passive skill ‘Sword Breaker’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Strength +50</span></p>
 <p><span style>Scale armor modified by the legendary blacksmith Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 621 small, iron plates made by hand and joined into three layers has ensured a high defense and range of movement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In addition, each iron plate has a small groove. If the enemy’s weapon strikes it, there is a certain probability of the weapon being damaged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like the black dragon scales, these 621 iron plates will shine whenever the wearer moves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ogre’s blood was used to increase the durability of the leather straps, slightly increasing the strength of the wearer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>User Restriction: Level 320 or higher. 1,500 strength. 1,830 stamina. Advanced Heavy Armor Mastery Level 5 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 2,501</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A legendary rated item was produced, so all stats have permanently risen by +10 and reputation throughout the continent has risen by +500.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been two and a half years since he became Pagma’s Descendant. Not in game time, but in real time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had made a huge number of items in the meantime, but only 12 legendary items so far.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had no luck, despite being a legendary blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Grid cleared his mind.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the process of making items, Grid didn’t dare think about making legendary items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But today.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had a hard time over the past few months due to the Behen Archipelago, and now he made a legendary item after a long time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was filled with anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Finally... Finally, the heavens knows my skills and heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Being rewarded for their efforts, it might be natural for geniuses, but not ordinary people.&nbsp;</span><span style>No matter how hard they tried, they often didn’t get reasonable rewards.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was particularly bad for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now Grid’s efforts were seeing results.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a result achieved through Grid’s growth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay... Keep this momentum going.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was very pleased with the result.&nbsp;</span><span style>The material used for the Holy Light Set was adamantium, so the options and durability were much better. However, the defense of the Three Layers was superior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Next is the helmet and leggings.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The balance patch to the National Competition that nerfed him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Grid’s attack power, which is his biggest weapon, is suppressed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smiled as he recalled that headline.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m not a damage dealer.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Items were flexible.&nbsp;</span><span style>An overgeared person could be a damage dealer or tanker.&nbsp;</span><span style>In this National Competition, Grid was planning to show off an attack power that didn’t yield to the patch, as well as his defense.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, he would be a flawless damage dealer tank that would overturn the world.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The helmet, leggings, and gauntlet were gradually completed, while Lantier’s Cloak was reproduced through Item Creation.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t long before he would become a matchless overgeared person.</span></p>
