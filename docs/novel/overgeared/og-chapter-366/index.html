 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was well aware of the importance of drills as a former member of the South Korean army.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was to quickly and easily control the army, for order and unity, to reduce the number of incidents, and to instill a sense of purpose.&nbsp;</span><span style>Drills were the most basic and crucial virtue of the army.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The biggest reason why an army operates effectively is due to the formations. Imagine a large group of people. What if the shield troops were in the rear and the archers were in the vanguard? Isn’t that just rubbish?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The higher the level of training, the faster the speed of the formation. The faster the speed that a formation was formed, the higher the probability was of winning the war.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid smiled as he watched the instructor explain why drills were so important.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In the past, I wasn’t able to concentrate.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reserves were brought to the training ground and given theoretical education.&nbsp;</span><span style>What type of game was this?&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past, Grid had grumbled and couldn’t concentrate on learning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey, Blue Falcon."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instructor Kaesul &nbsp;glared at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why is it that you doze off every time I an educating you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Patrian was a fortified city, so the military training was very strict.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, this also applied to players.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is my education useless? Have you already mastered this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The instructor shouted angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stand up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid stood up.&nbsp;</span><span style>He knew it was wrong to laugh at the instructor, and absolute obedience was necessary to receive a passing score.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Attention! Parade rest! Align right!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid followed the simple command while the instructor smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will teach you to smile while I’m talking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, the instructor forced Grid to follow all types of actions.&nbsp;</span><span style>He tried to make it confusing and complex by making Grid move to the front, back, and right side, then he would punish Grid when he got it wrong.&nbsp;</span><span style>However...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Cheok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Cheok cheok cheok cheok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘Wow.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instructor Kaesul was puzzled when Grid didn’t hesitate when following the orders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blue Falcon, Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He never received a passing grade in any training and was inferior to the other troops, so how could he follow this?&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite his weak stamina, he performed the commands perfectly without losing concentration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was something even more surprising.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Did his eyes always look like this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was famous with Instructor Kaeul and the assistants.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was dumb, not motivated, weak, and had eyes like rotten fish.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Grid wasn’t stupid, was full of desire, and concentrated enough to overcome his weak stamina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rotten fish eyes?&nbsp;</span><span style>They were sharp and keen, like there was a reversal.&nbsp;</span><span style>Some people would shrink back when facing it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Hum hum.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When would this inferior soldier collapse?&nbsp;</span><span style>Instructor Kaesul kept giving commands and eventually gave up.&nbsp;</span><span style>He cleared his throat and spoke while avoiding Grid’s gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have mastered these drills. How hard did you practice? Go back to your spot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid responded vigorously and rejoined the ranks.&nbsp;</span><span style>Honestly, he didn’t feel good.&nbsp;</span><span style>As the duke of a kingdom, he was being insulted by a trainer and tested on an extreme level?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was shameful.&nbsp;</span><span style>But this wasn’t a situation to hold onto his pride.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Right now, I’m only a level 23 warrior.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, this was currently the past.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had to conform to this situation in order to pass the 31st island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will conduct the test from now on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After around three hours of training, the test was started.&nbsp;</span><span style>The result was amazing.&nbsp;</span><span style>Blue Falcon Grid was ranked number one in the test.&nbsp;</span><span style>Compared to the other reservists, he maintained his concentration and performed the drills of the instructor completely and thoroughly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Did he eat something wrong?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The instructor and assistants were bewildered.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Camp building exercises.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was about climbing up a mountain behind the training ground and making a shelter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s just shovelling.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How hard is it to dig a pit?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reservists holding one shovel thought it was easy.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid knew the significance of building a camp.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was to provide cover from enemy attacks and to protect their teammates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It isn’t just digging a pit. It needs to have defensive power.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid judged and looked carefully at the mountain. Then he found a place where there were vines and bushes between two trees. He approached it and started digging.&nbsp;</span><span style>The other reservists laughed at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The trees and bushes will interfere with the digging action.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It will take a while to dig a pit.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Noob, no wonder why he’s being ignored by the instructor.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would receive the lowest points.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reservists made fun of Grid and started digging at the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their digging pace was incredible. It was obvious that they wanted to finish this tiresome training.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Grid’s digging speed was slow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Digging too quickly is exhausting.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had served in the Korean army for more than a year, so he was used to labor.&nbsp;</span><span style>For Grid, digging was one of his few specialties.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Digging works the heart and muscles because it leans on the upper body.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he didn’t want to collapse from tiredness, it was more effective to do it slowly and steadily.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>His right hand grasped the handle while his left hand grasped the bottom portion of the shovel.&nbsp;</span><span style>His speed was very slow compared to others, but that only lasted for a short period of time. The speed at which Grid dug the ground was three times faster than the others.&nbsp;</span><span style>The others became exhausted while Grid maintained his pace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah... Overcoming low stamina with know-how.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The instructor and assistants observing the reservists couldn’t keep their eyes off Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s digging skill was the best.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was enough to remind them of a professional digger.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was natural that Grid would take the first place in the camp building test.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s face brightened as he erased a few pathetic memories from the past.&nbsp;</span><span style>His high pride after fighting with Kraugel became more robust.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Weapons testing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reservists, who learned the basic skills of handling spears, swords, and bows, stood in front of a scarecrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instructor Kaesul shouted,&nbsp;</span><span style>"First is the spear!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blue, red, and green dots covered the bodies of the scarecrows in front of the reservists. The blue dots were the size of a 500 yen coin, while the red and green dots were like billiard balls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Over the next three minutes, the three types of dots will emerge alternately. You will get one point when striking the blue dot, 5 points for the red dot, and 10 points for the green dot. You will pass if you get at least 50 points in three minutes."</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, this was a test that Grid had never succeeded in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dots with the three colors flashed too quickly before disappearing, and there was no regularity. In the past, Grid couldn’t exert much control over the spear and wasn’t able to gain 50 points in three minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now it was different.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Cheok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid moved his right foot back and wielded the spear.&nbsp;</span><span style>He’d hunted with the strongest spearman Pon, and got a look at the spear techniques and movements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>More than anything, the current Grid...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am a person who understands the divine spear.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once he understood the structure of a weapon, he naturally realized how to use it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Flash!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s eyes saw the signal in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Beeeok-!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The instructors, assistants and even reservists were surprised by the sound and turned their attention to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had stabbed precisely at the blue dot on the scarecrow.&nbsp;</span><span style>Everyone who saw it were shocked beyond admiration, but Grid wasn’t satisfied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Indeed, my agility is too low.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The speed of the spear was slow and it wasn’t very precise. He tried to aim at the center of the blue dot, but it deviated to the left.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was complaining when he suddenly realized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Kraugel wouldn’t complain like me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would overcome the ordeal, no matter how bad his condition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yes, I don’t have the time for regrets.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He concentrated harder and tried to use the spear to the best of his ability.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The spear let out a sound again as it struck.&nbsp;</span><span style>The instructor couldn’t close his mouth when he saw that Grid once again hit the blue spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No, what’s up with him today?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew the Blue Falcon.&nbsp;</span><span style>He seemed like a completely different person.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Diririri-</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, Grid’s scarecrow scoreboard achieved 100 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The instructor turned pale.&nbsp;</span><span style>100 points in 1 minute and 23 seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid set a record that even the most experienced knight apprentices couldn’t beat.&nbsp;</span><span style>The instructor couldn’t tell if this was a dream or reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A notification window appeared in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have set a new record in Patrian’s reserve forces training Spear Test!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The rare skill ‘Spear Shot’ has been acquired as a hidden reward.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Spear Shot Lv.1]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Throws a spear that deals 600% physical damage to the target. The enemy will fall down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>* You must reclaim the spear in the thrown window. If you fail to retrieve it within 30 seconds, you will lose ownership of the spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mana Consumption: 150</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: 1 minute</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was astonished by the completely unexpected benefit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a hassle to recover the thrown spear, but compared to Pagma’s Swordsmanship, the skill cooldown time was very short and the damage was also good. In addition, it was a medium range skill that would be useful in many ways.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This... Will I be able to get rare skills in the sword test and archery test?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s motivation grew even more.</span></p>
