 <p><span style>Chapter 255</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Strength was relative.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared Guild was called a group of powerhouses, but it was possible to distinguish between the weak and strong within them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Based on the Overgeared members, Lauel was part of the weak group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid, Pon, Regas, Jishuka, Faker, Euphemina, Toon and Vantner, all the strongest ones were missing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But even so...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>15 against 1.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hao really endured for five minutes. To be exact, it was five minutes and three seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was something that even Pon or Regas couldn’t do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The two of them would’ve killed almost half of us in three minutes, then they would’ve died.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was Grid?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘...We would be wiped out in a few minutes.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s abilities had grown by leaps and bounds since the doppelganger raid. Lauel didn’t want to imagine it.&nbsp;</span><span style>He clicked his tongue.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he analyzed Hao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Clever.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A person who transformed into a draconian.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hao fully utilized the characteristics of a half draconian as well as the desert landscape.&nbsp;</span><span style>Aiming Flame Explosion at the sand constantly caused a sandstorm to appear, obstructing the vision of the Overgeared members. He also used his flying ability to avoid fatal skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rather than killing his enemies, he thoroughly fought in order to buy time.&nbsp;</span><span style>His persistence and control of the chain that tied down the Overgeared members was enough to cause a thrill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill me.”&nbsp;</span><span style>As Lauel was deep in thought, Hao was caught by Ibellin and spoke proudly.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t fear death.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was satisfied that he allowed his guild members to retreat safely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the faces of the Overgeared members were completely twisted.&nbsp;</span><span style>15 people were tied up by one person for more than five minutes, causing their pride to be crushed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hao comforted them. It was the attitude of a winner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You aren’t weak. You are stronger than the rumors. However, I am just exceptional.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t arrogance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hao’s words weren’t wrong.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members were stronger than in the past due to Piaro, but Hao surpassed them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Hrmm.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A smile appeared on Lauel’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style>In fact, in this battle, Lauel felt a bigger sense of defeat than anyone else.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the one who led the group.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was proud of the tactics that he could carry out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The chief of staff, Lauel, was unable to cope with Hao properly.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel was tactically defeated by Hao.&nbsp;</span><span style>But.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I won.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel’s smile widened.&nbsp;</span><span style>He told Hao the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Hades Guild’s retreat failed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Bah, what benefits are there to lying now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t a lie. Check the guild chat if you don’t believe me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a moment.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hao’s eyes trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You..! What did you do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel explained.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I guessed the retreat route of the Hades Guild and left someone there. I also ordered the team wiping out the Golden Guild to head there when they finished.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A separate force.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was Faker who had recovered from wiping out the Ice Flower Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>Currently, the Hades Guild was isolated by Faker and Huroi’s group at the border between the empire and the western part of the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dammit...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hao was frustrated.&nbsp;</span><span style>If they were going to die anyway, he should’ve at least taken out one more enemy.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was feeling regret when Lauel suggested,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Are you willing to serve Duke Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The leader of one of the seven guilds, the one in the lead of billions of people, why should he go under someone?&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, it was under a trivial guy, whose only advantage was his legendary class?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A dragon can’t serve a dog.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Hao refused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The faces of the Overgeared members turned red as Grid was called a dog.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don’t bother with anything unnecessary and just kill me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ibellin had suffered from being dragged by chains throughout the battle, so he was angrier than anyone else.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel restrained him as he was about to stab his flamberge through Hao’s heart. Then he asked Hao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid is the sky, not a dog... If he proves this fact, will you serve him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel coveted Hao.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t just due to his powerful force.&nbsp;</span><span style>The noble spirit that sacrificed himself for his subordinates, as well as the appropriate tactical abilities were all coveted by Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was a necessary person to the Overgeared Guild, who only tended to focus on individual power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hao snorted.&nbsp;</span><span style>"There is already a sky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>The sky they were talking about was Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid wasn’t a match.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel laughed at Hao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay. I am looking forward to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hao was stunned as Lauel released him.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t understand the situation as Lauel continued speaking,&nbsp;</span><span style>“I’m looking forward to the day we’re reunited. I will let all of your guild members go safely, so please don’t worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t be willing to serve Grid, even if you do this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Will you serve Grid if he proves that he is the sky?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, but...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could a dog or cow become the sky?&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel grinned triumphantly at Hao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Watch his path. You will soon know that he is the only sky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Hah.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Hao laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was this the level of a fanatic?&nbsp;</span><span style>It felt like there was a pseudo-religion based on Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Okay, I understand. I will watch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hao wasn’t expecting anything.&nbsp;</span><span style>He accepted the favor and immediately left this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ibellin didn’t like it and asked Lauel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They are the bastards who invaded Reidan for no reason! Why are you letting him go? Are you crazy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Didn’t you hear the report from Huroi? According to the Golden Guild’s statement, isn’t Reidan safe? You should think more practically, rather than being overcome by petty grudges.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit! What will happen if they try to strike again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"At that time."&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel’s blue eyes froze over.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>"After we kill them, we will trample on their estates.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wouldn’t allow an invasion a second time, and there would be no more forgiveness.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Day arrived.&nbsp;</span><span style>Reidan’s fields.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the early morning, the Overgeared members came to where the farmers were sweating.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel bowed deeply to Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Thank you for saving Reidan. This great grace, I will spend the rest of my life repaying it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style>“It’s okay. I just acting according to the value of the meals.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Value of the meal...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The price of a meal for a farmer was 73 silver.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Reidan is worth 73 silver...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel’s feelings were complicated.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel looked around at the vast farming fields.&nbsp;</span><span style>The harvest was in full swing. Good quality wheat was being produced in large quantities. In the future, the people of Reidan would be able to eat bread, not just potatoes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was all due to Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>Not only did he do the work of 100 people alone, he kept finding sources of water and bringing life to the fields.&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite being a great swordsman, he wasn’t arrogant, faithfully carried out his duties, and showed respect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However... I heard there were a lot of enemies. How did you repel them by yourself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel heard it from the enemies, but he honestly didn’t believe it.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, there were many people with a strong reputation among the enemies, such as Zibal, Seuron and Hao.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro repelled all of them?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was impossible unless Piaro was a legend on the level of Pagma or Muller.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It can’t be...’ He couldn’t imagine that the ‘legendary farmer emergence’ message that appeared last night was referring to Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro aimed for a sword saint. He wasn’t a farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style>As Lauel was feeling puzzled, Piaro pointed to three farmers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One was Bland and the other two were wearing straw hats, so he couldn’t see who they were.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"They helped me."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were more farmers in Reidan who were great warriors?&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel approached them.&nbsp;</span><span style>The two farmers cutting the wheat with a sickle panicked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don’t want to meet you...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 1st ranked Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t want to let others know that he had been working in the fields for two weeks already. It would be a big nuisance.&nbsp;</span><span style>So he...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My mother is calling me. I need to go. Logout.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Logging out to a parent’s intervention.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a phenomena that frightened many of Satisfy’s users.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were people who were forced to terminate the game during a raid because their mother told them to eat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>In such cases, the users were registered on a blacklist and it would be difficult for them to participate in a raid group again. Anyway, this happened, so Damian was left alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh? Who was just here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was very surprised to see the person he thought was a NPC log out.&nbsp;</span><span style>A user was working as a farmer in Reidan?&nbsp;</span><span style>He must have a high level, so why was he working as a farmer...?&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel’s confusion and doubts poured onto Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you? Why are you doing field work here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian wasn’t prepared.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was embarrassed to reveal that a high ranking paladin was acting as a farmer.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to log out.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, he soon changed his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He is the person closest to Grid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he explained to Lauel why he had to meet Grid, it would be easier to arrange a meeting with Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Damian took off his straw hat.&nbsp;</span><span style>The dark blue, purplish hair caught Lauel’s attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y-You...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel’s eyes shook as the attractive appearance was revealed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style>An exceptional person who rose to become the number two paladin, despite being a paladin of the Rebeccan Church.&nbsp;</span><span style>But one day, he suddenly disappeared from the rankings list so there were rumors that he obtained a hidden class.&nbsp;</span><span style>And he was an otaku.&nbsp;</span><span style>Why was such a famous person doing field work here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian awkwardly greeted the speechless Lauel and Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
