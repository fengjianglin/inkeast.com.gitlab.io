 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>After crossing the Suaz Mountains, Grid was able to arrive in Rolling.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rolling was a small village, but if he headed south for half a day, he would finally arrive at the Vatican.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are Rebecca statues everywhere.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were large and small Rebecca statues in every street, store or house. He could find one or two statues no matter what direction he turned his head. Well, the residents of Rolling seemed to serve Goddess Rebecca.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is geographically located near the Vatican, so it makes sense that the Rebecca Church is the main religion of the village...’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Nyang~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He leaned back against a Rebecca statue and enjoyed the warm sun and the peaceful cats. The merchants and residents were going about their daily routine without moving fast.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid also felt calm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s a different place from Winston. It feels like a resort.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hum emerged.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid walked around the village with a free heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Am I crazy?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He needed to complete the quest as quickly as possible! Tourism was just a waste of time!</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I have been lazy lately.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was well aware of what happened when a person became lazy. He might become debt-ridden again if he wasn’t alert.&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to his past trauma, Grid became irritated and hasted his pace. He headed towards a smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The effect of mastering ‘Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill’ is activated. Blacksmith NPCs whose craftsmanship skill is beyond the intermediate level will treat you in a friendly manner.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[’Pagma’s Descendant’ class effect is activated. Blacksmith NPCs whose craftsmanship skill is at the advanced level will treat recognize you and worship you.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Notification windows he hadn’t seen for a while popped up when he entered the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had been living in Winston for a while and only entered Khan’s smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was Rolling’s blacksmith an intermediate or advanced blacksmith?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid wanted to be admired. However...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Welcome~"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blacksmith approached Grid. Unfortunately, he was a young blacksmith and seemed to only be at a beginner level. He was unable to tell Grid apart from an ordinary customer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there anything you were looking for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid sighed with disappointment and replied.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I want to repair my items.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I will repair it for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid doubted his ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You will repair my items?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A beginner blacksmith was going to repair the items of a legendary blacksmith!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid scoffed.&nbsp;</span><span style>“You are either brave or ignorant... You don’t even know who I am...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey hey. Cut it out. I’m a blacksmith, so I will fix my own items. Can I borrow your furnace? I will pay a fee.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rolling’s blacksmith, Rector, cautioned Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Are you really a blacksmith?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was armed with steel gauntlets, black iron boots and heavy armor. What type of blacksmith would go around wearing this? Grid seemed like a warrior at first glance, so it was hard to see him as a blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid clicked his tongue.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Do you doubt that I am a blacksmith? What a poor guy... You can’t even tell who a great blacksmith is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rector was a young man who was only 20 years old. He was young, but he could understand that Grid was talking badly about him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Rector’s face reddened with shame.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid felt sorry for him and cleared his throat several times. Then he carefully said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But who can tell the future? Even if your eyes are rotten right now, they can be trained... Watch me. This is a rare chance. You should thank Goddess Rebecca for being able to meet me and see how I work.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid no longer sought permission from Rector. He approached the furnace and started to light it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey! You will be burned if you do that... Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rector’s eyes widened. It was because Grid quickly raised the temperature of the blast furnace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Handling the fire so freely? How is that possible?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even his father, an intermediate blacksmith who died two years ago, couldn’t handle the fire as easily as Grid. Grid seemed like the embodiment of fire.&nbsp;</span><span style>As Rector was feeling admiration, Grid pulled out a hammer and anvil from his inventory. Then he started to repair his items one by one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The durability of the Ideal Dagger has been maximized.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This is an item you created. Your understanding is 100%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The durability of the Best Gauntlets has been maximized.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This is an item you created. Your understanding is 100%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[In the case of items made by you, a penalty will be applied if you don’t meet the item usage requirements, even if you have full understanding.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The durability of Khan's Masterpiece has been maximized.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your understanding of Khan's Masterpiece is at 100%. You have learned the production method and can use it without any penalties.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The durability of Dainsleif (Reproduction) has been maximized.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your understanding of Dainsleif (Reproduction) has increased from 3% to 31%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The durability of the Frostlight Orc Chief’s Helmet has been maximized.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your understanding of the Frostlight Orc Chief’s Helmet has increased from 7% to 85%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The durability of Braham’s Boots has been maximized.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your understanding of Braham’s Boots has increased from 3% to 6%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Understanding an item was a concept that only existed for Pagma's Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagma's Descendant was able to increase their understanding of an item by using the item, appraising it, repairing and disassembling it. They were then able to freely use items with 100% understanding. It was even possible to learn the production method.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Dainsleif’s understanding was at 100%, Grid would be able to produce Dainsleif.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the higher the rating and usage conditions of the item, the slower the comprehension. Therefore, it was still unclear when he would be able to learn how to make it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But the Orc Frostlight Chief’s Helmet has a high understanding. Hmm, should I try for 100% understanding?’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid placed the perfectly repaired Frostlight Orc Chief’s Helmet on the anvil and started hammering again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'He’s crazy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rector was amazed and surprised while watching Grid repair the items.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid suddenly hitting the perfectly fine skull helmet seemed like a crazy person.&nbsp;</span><span style>And...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i> <i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to Grid’s unstoppable hammering, the Frostlight Orc Chief’s Helmet was instantly shattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Why is he destroying a perfectly good helmet like this? He’s too violent.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rector misunderstood. He thought that Grid was destroying the helmet, but he was actually using the Legendary Blacksmith’s Disassembly skill to break down and reassemble it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Putting the wires in the seams like this... It’s sloppy. I'm going to need to supplement this part.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid perfectly grasped the structure of the helmet and started to assemble it again. It wasn’t a simple assembly. Grid complemented the disadvantages of the helmet during the assembly process.&nbsp;</span><span style>It didn’t take long for the Frostlight Orc Chief’s Helmet to be restored to its original shape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your understanding of the Frostlight Orc Chief’s Helmet has increased to 100%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[From now on, you can use the Frostlight Orc Chief’s Helmet without any penalties.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The production method of the Frostlight Orc Chief’s Helmet has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Okay."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid equipped the Frostlight Orc Chief’s Helmet with a pleased face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Due to your class characteristics, you have equipped the Frostlight Orc Chief’s Helmet.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You don’t meet the conditions to use the item. However, your understanding is 100%, so no penalties will be applied.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Frostlight Orc Chief’s Helmet]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Unique (Set)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 290/290 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 190</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The chance of suffering a critical blow is reduced by 25%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Health will increase by 15%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Has a certain chance to cast fear at the target.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Frostlight Orc Chief’s set effect: </span></p>
 <p><span style>-3 set items equipped: Strength +50, stamina +80.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-5 set items equipped: Strength +100, stamina +200, can transform into the frostlight orc chief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*Frostlight Orc Chief’s transformation:</span></p>
 <p><span style>-It is possible to command the frostlight orcs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-The skill ‘Rotation Cut’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The frostlight orc chief can be described as the ruler of the northern snowfields. This helmet, which he loved, was made from the skull of a snowy ogre and has a terrible appearance. In particular, the horn on the left has a very threatening appearance. Just wearing this helmet can cause fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally there was a sense of crudeness, but a craftsman with great talent and potential had reassembled it, complementing the weaknesses and enhancing the function.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Conditions of Use: Level 150 or more. More than 400 strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 800&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk... Truly great.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was impressed as he verified the improved performance of the helmet. Then he turned his attention to Rector while wearing the helmet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How about it? Don’t you think this helmet is somewhat cool?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“H-Hik...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rector paled. It was because the bizarre skull helmet felt so terrible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid saw his expression and sighed.&nbsp;</span><span style>"It seems to be my mistake... Damn, I need to replace this helmet quickly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid grumbled as he approached Rector and handed over 10 silver.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you watch me well? You should start practicing from now on, while trying to recall how I used the bellows and my hammering. Perhaps we’ll see each other again. Your skills might be low now, but you might become an intermediate blacksmith after 10 years of practice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was joking.&nbsp;</span><span style>He never imagined that Rector would take his joke seriously as he left the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rector jumped up. Then he locked the door of the smith and listened to Grid’s advice(?), practicing his handling of the bellows and hammering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And later.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rector, who was inherently gifted, became an advanced blacksmith who represented this area. He would often tell his disciples the story of how he met Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid didn’t know this.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The village center.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was amazed as he stood in front of the Rebecca Temple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Gold?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The temple here was small compared to other temples in the area. It was a single story building that was less than 100 pyeongs (1 pyeong=3.3058m). But the outer walls were painted in gold and shining brilliantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is there any way to get this...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid looked around at the other people before scratching the gold with his nails. But no matter how hard he scratched, not one speck of gold dust fell off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How rotten and dirty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t give up. He didn’t want to miss an opportunity to get free gold.&nbsp;</span><span style>His appearance and scratching at the gold revealed that he was obvious a first time visitor to Rolling.&nbsp;</span><span style>A middle-aged priest found him and gave a meaningful smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'It has been a long time since I’ve seen a sucker.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The priest’s ID was Dong Pao.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was a Chinese user.&nbsp;</span><span style>He followed the rigid laws of the Rebecca Church such as forbidding love, forced silence and fasting, and managed to raise his level to 160.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He grinned and approached Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Brother, is this your first visit to Rolling?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid flinched from where he was squatting in a corner and scratching at the gold. ‘I’m not a thief, hahaha!’ He laughed loudly while trembling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah~! Yes! It is my first time here! Oh, this temple is so beautiful! It reminds me of the beautiful Goddess Rebecca! Hahahahat! Yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person who suddenly greeted him was wearing the clothes of the Rebecca Church.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was so worried about being called a thief that he hadn’t noticed until now.&nbsp;</span><span style>The priest in front of him was a user, not an NPC.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is the first time I’ve seen a priest user.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had heard rumors about how difficult it was to become a Rebecca priest. In fact, all Rebecca priests that Grid had met since playing Satisfy were NPCs.&nbsp;</span><span style>So it was surprising that middle-aged priest in front of him was a user, not an NPC.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘His ID is Dong Pao... Chinese...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ID was somewhat appetizing. Grid pledged to visit a Chinese restaurant today with his family and eat Dongpo pork.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you a monk in reality? How did you manage to clear the Rebecca Church’s class change quest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong Pao laughed heartily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"In reality, I’m just an ordinary person. However, in Satisfy, I succeeded in suppressing all desires while thinking that I only want to serve Goddess Rebecca... Then I was able to become a priest of sacred light.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow... I don’t know about anything else, but staying silent seems pretty hard. Well, I can’t date anyway... No, I don’t want a relationship, but it will be hard to withstand the silence and fasting... Weren’t you supposed to stay silent for 20 days? How did you manage it? And even if you succeed in the priest class change quest, don’t you have to perform quests often if you want to keep the position? It’s great that you could endure all of that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The original Grid was indifferent to other people’s matters. But this was his first experience meeting a priest user, so he was naturally interested.&nbsp;</span><span style>When he was in a bad situation, he became sick when he saw others doing well. Now he had paid off his debt and was running along a part of success, so he could praise others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong Pao smiled at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was difficult to remain silent. But when I prayed to Goddess Rebecca, the time passed quickly. The act of praying itself raises the divine power stat, so if you think about it positively, it is good to be disciplined. But what brings you to Rolling? There’s no special hunting ground or sightseeing spots besides the Vatican, so most people who visit here have business in the Vatican...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m on the way to the Vatican. I need to meet the pope for a quest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah... His Holiness?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong Pao’s eyes shone sharply at the words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Someone who isn’t part of the Rebecca Church is on a quest to meet the pope? Even I have only seen the pope from afar. It seems like he is on a S-grade or higher quest.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong Pao observed Grid’s equipment closely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The armor and gauntlets are ordinary... That cloak is garbage... The only accessory is a ring that looks simple... But the boots are tremendously expensive. Yes, he must be a high level.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rolling was far from the centre of the continent. It was difficult to come here without being a high level because the roads were difficult and full of monsters.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dong Pao was pleased at the thought of Grid being a high level user.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He will have a high value.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong Pao’s eyes curved into a half moon as he suggested to Grid,&nbsp;</span><span style>“I am also on my way to the Vatican. Do you want to accompany me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If a healer accompanied him, how much money would he save on potions? Others had to pay money to party with a healer, but he could party with one for free?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid readily accepted this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course I would like that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the two people formed a party.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was surprised when he saw Dong Pao’s level in the party window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Level 160? I know that priest is a difficult class to level up, so isn’t this level very high?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are many quests to be done, so there’s no time to raise my level. However, due to the nature of the class, it’s easy to find a party. I hunted with a high level party and quickly raised my level. But Mister Grid... You’re level 147? That is surprisingly low.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haha, I don’t have much time to raise my level. I’ve only been able to raise it lately.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, yes...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong Pao made an uncomfortable expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He crossed the Suaz Mountains alone at this level? Did he avoid the ogres and gargoyles? He has good luck... Damm, I thought he would be at least level 160...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong Pao used his status as a priest to lure high-level travellers to a certain place that couldn’t be logged out of. He made money by intimidating, killing or ransoming travellers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Level 147...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was obvious, but the higher the level of prey, the higher the ransom value. Level 147 was ambiguous. It was higher than the average level, but it wasn’t that high compared to the rankers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'If he’s level 147, he can recover the experience lost through dying by hunting... He won’t pay a large amount of money for his life... Tsk, this is annoying. I’ll have to make money by killing him and selling the boots.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the two of them went on a short journey to the Vatican.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a group watching them from the entrance of the village.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Dong Pao has started the game.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay. We can follow slowly and eat up the profit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were three people.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were assassin users who joined hands with Dong Pao.&nbsp;</span><span style>The fifth ranked assassin Shay, the 11th ranked Kerb, and the 13th ranked Sniffer.&nbsp;</span><span style>The three of them had managed to assassinate a user who was 51st on the unified rankings, so there was no doubting their skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was the target of some bigwigs. But Grid didn’t know this and was just excited at the thought of partying with a priest.</span></p>
