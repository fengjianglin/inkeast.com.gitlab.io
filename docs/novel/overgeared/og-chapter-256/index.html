 <p><span style>Chapter 256</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The VIP room in the lord’s castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian sat facing the Overgeared members and opened his mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style>He talked about how he met Grid and the circumstances behind his arrival in Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian explained all the facts as much as possible. There was no reason to hide it from the Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The silently listening Vantner started tearing up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Struggling to save a beloved woman...! It’s truly a beautiful story!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t good seeing a big bald man crying.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Pon was here, he would definitely tease Vantner.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Pon was still on the mission with Regas. They had already disappeared for two days. It was estimated that they discovered an instance dungeon and were cut off from the outside world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel ignored Vantner’s runny nose and asked Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I understand that you have to meet Grid in order to save Rebecca’s Daughters. But why were you working in the fields? Someone like you would’ve been treated very well if you visited the administrator, and then we could’ve been contacted quickly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were dozens of large and small religions in Satisfy, but the Rebecca Church was unequaled. The number of members was estimated to exceed 80 million.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian was a pope candidate, so he would be given VIP treatment wherever he went.&nbsp;</span><span style>So why was he farming?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian wanted to throw up as the Overgeared members looked at him with confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why didn’t he meet the administrator of the city?’ This was all due to Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he was too embarrassed to tell them the truth.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, his grudge against Piaro disappeared after receiving the hidden quest. Rather, they were friends now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He covered up the truth.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I originally liked doing farming work.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>People always had a variety of hobbies.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was no reason to lie, so the Overgeared members didn’t doubt Damian’s words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members didn’t know about the atrocities Piaro was committing outside.&nbsp;</span><span style>They couldn’t imagine that Piaro would fight people passing them, then make them become farmers.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian felt sorry for the second and third victims who would appear in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who was the other person with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“An outsider. I don’t know who he is either. He never revealed his identity until the end.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Perhaps I should put the Eyes of Surveillance on him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel wasn’t too wary. Piaro would’ve filtered out anyone who wanted to harm Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel trusted Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Lauel’s concern was focused solely on Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If Grid is the benefactor of the pope...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The relationship between Reidan and the Rebecca Church would become closer, and there would be an active exchange.&nbsp;</span><span style>If they could build a Rebecca Temple in Reidan, all residents would get the buff effect and there would be priests present. The number of people would also naturally increase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel grabbed Damian’s dirty hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damian, the Overgeared Guild is wholeheartedly committed to helping you. I will help you win the pope election, as well as persuade Grid to save Rebecca’s Daughters. Just tell me if you have anything you need.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a pumpkin vine that rolled over. Lauel absolutely wouldn’t miss it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel smiled as kindly as possible. It was the smile of hospitality workers.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Damian wasn’t familiar with Lauel and was genuinely thrilled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"So kind...! Thank you! Thank you so much! I will give you a pillow printed with an image of my beautiful Isabel-chan as a present!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huhuhut... I’m glad to be able to help you. The alter ego that I sealed in the past is dancing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What are they saying?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don’t know.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members couldn’t properly interpret the conversation between Lauel and Damian. It was hard to crack.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit was aware of Piaro’s abilities, even before the Overgeared members knew Piaro’s identity. It wasn’t difficult to grasp the reality of a person with his discerning eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even so, there was only one reason why he left Piaro as a farmer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reidan’s finances.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he acknowledged Piaro’s skills and gave him the right position, Rabbit would have to pay him a high salary.&nbsp;</span><span style>This would increase Reidan’s financial burdens.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rabbit pretended not to know Piaro’s true abilities and kept him as a farmer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As as result, Rabbit got the maximum efficiency for a minimum wage.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, the wheat fields were a farmer’s domain.&nbsp;</span><span style>The farmer Piaro, who received a salary of 73 silver, defended Reidan by defeating the enemies who invaded his territory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The result was more than expected. It was truly amazing. But at the same time, it was frustrating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I need to reward him for his performance...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Rabbit converted the value of Piaro’s work to money, it would be at least several hundred million gold.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, Reidan didn’t have those type of funds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to give him something.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A granting of a prize was the domain of the lord, not the administrator.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was currently away, so it was impossible to give the right compensation to Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Then...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit showed the utmost sincerity to Piaro within the scope of his current authority.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[I, Administrator Rabbit, appoint the farmer Piaro to become the wheat fields manager.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the moment when Piaro’s salary was raised to 2 gold and 30 silver. It was a wage increase of more than three times.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the amount of money that Rabbit’s conscience allowed.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[One of the continent’s 10 great magicians fighting for Duke Grid!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The provocative title heated up the Internet all over the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The real-time search queries were taken up by ‘Grid,’ ‘Earl Ashur,’ ‘10 great magicians of the continent,’ ‘seven guilds,’ ‘Reidan’s invasion,’ and so on. The news about the emergence of a legendary farmer was buried under all of this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny, the one who spread this incident, received a huge jackpot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The seven guilds except for the Giant Guild conspired to invade Reidan. In the process, the Yak Guild and Zeraph Guild were ruthlessly trampled on by Earl Ashur.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>The contents and images meant that Bunny Bunny’s live internet broadcast reached 300,000, and the cumulative viewers rose to 600,000 in one day.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bunny Bunny not only accumulated an enormous wealth, he also recovered his reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The world’s best gaming BJ succeeded in a splendid recovery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Grid is amazing.</span></i> <i><span style>He has Earl Ashur as a subordinate. ㄷㄷ</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Isn’t Earl Ashur the strongest person in the Eternal Kingdom...?</span></i> <i><span style>Wow, really?</span></i> <i><span style>He really is God Grid.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I’m living in the US and Grid appears on TV every day. &nbsp;ㅋㅋㅋ I don’t think there is anyone in the US who doesn’t know about Grid. &nbsp;ㅋㅋㅋ</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I’m going to school in Japan. After the National Competition, all my Japanese friends ask me about Grid.</span></i> <i><span style>I am proud to be Korean thanks to Grid-nim.ㅎ</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-But what about the four guilds apart from the Yak Guild and Zeraph Guild?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>My friend’s cousin’s wife’s friend is part of the Golden Guild and according to him, the seven guilds were wiped out by the farmers of Reidan.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Sigh...</span></i><span style> ㅉ ㅉ </span><i><span style>There is a fantasy novelist everywhere.</span></i> <i><span style>If you are writing a novel, it should at least make sense.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Korean netizens were particularly excited.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were proud to be Korean every time Grid did something that caught the attention of the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But in fact, Grid himself didn’t know about Reidan’s invasion.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members didn’t report anything to him because they were afraid it would interfere with his quest.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to that, Grid was able to solely concentrate on his quest.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The capital of the Saharan Empire, Titan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid arrived in front of Asmophel’s mansion after a three week journey and opened his status window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Grid</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level: 291</span></p>
 <p><span style>Class: Pagma’s Descendant</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strength: 2,770(+140) &nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 1,246(+120) &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agility: 1,626(+110) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligence: 711(+310)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dexterity: 1,634(+660) &nbsp;&nbsp;Persistence: 958(+110)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Composure: 658(+110) &nbsp;Indomitable: 913(+220)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dignity: 1,566(+110) &nbsp;&nbsp;Insight: 1,406(+110)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Courage: 602(+110) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demonic Magic Power: 31</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The stats were beyond overwhelming.&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to the penalty that happened when producing his fifth legendary item, his stats growth rate was several times slower than it was in the past, but he wasn’t disappointed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He still grew when making items and the titles he acquired after much hardships also significantly increased his stats.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had items, skills, and now control.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid could confidently assert,</span> <span style>‘I am the best.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had reached his peak after living 28 years. His confidence and motivation boiled over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Asmophel.”&nbsp;</span><span style>The person who framed Piaro as a traitor.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Now it’s time for you to lose.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The red light of the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch shone as he put on the white Hooded Zip Up.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Asmophel was a noble and sincere man.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was born as the eldest son of Earl Pedro, one of the three fingers of the emperor and loyal to his role while suffering from severe pressure.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t neglect training in the sword according to the laws of his family. As a result, he joined the Red Knights at a young age and raised his reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a life of fragility.&nbsp;</span><span style>He built new achievements almost every day and expanded his social network. Amosphel was praised as a pillar of the empire along with his closest friend, Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he lost everything the moment he fell for Empress Marie’s trick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He stabbed the dagger in the hearts of his friends and colleagues.&nbsp;</span><span style>Every day was a nightmare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn bitch!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ku tang tang tang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Amosphel knocked over the table filled with alcohol.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Marie.&nbsp;</span><span style>He borrowed the power of alcohol to forget about that damn woman, but he couldn’t forget.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her intense beauty couldn’t be erased from his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Piaro...! My friend!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was sorry. Really sorry.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had shouted it over a hundred times already.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he was well aware that his heart couldn’t be passed onto Piaro. That made his heart more pained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The knights heard the fuss and came running.&nbsp;</span><span style>They wore red armor.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were knights loyal to Marie, who watched over Asmophel under the name of protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to them, Asmophel was trapped in this mansion for years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Dog scum..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asmophel didn’t hide his hatred and anger. He looked around to find a weapon. But there were no weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style>The knights whispered to each other before bringing over a magician.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a black magician.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asmophel trembled as soon as he saw the black magician.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"S-Stop!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He tried to resist, but it was useless.&nbsp;</span><span style>He suffered a serious injury from Piaro and his body and mind had been compromised by drugs and black magic for years. Therefore, he now had a weak iron will.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A powerful brainwashing magic was used and Asmophel’s angry and fearful face became expressionless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is Piaro?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A traitor of the empire and your enemy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asmophel’s eyes became wet as he answered the questions without hesitation.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the remnant of the tears he shed before being brainwashed.</span></p>
