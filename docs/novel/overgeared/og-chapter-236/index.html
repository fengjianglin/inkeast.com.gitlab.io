 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Grid and the Overgeared members returned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It took four days, which was twice as long as the planned schedule.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rabbit came out and met them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was worried since you were late.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner grumbled,&nbsp;</span><span style>"As part of training, we defeated all of the monsters on the way and back from the destination.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid received the grumbles and laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style>"We’ve become a lot stronger thanks to that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was true.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the past four days, they constantly hunted as well as raided the doppelganger. Therefore, the Overgeared members made tremendous progress. It wasn’t just increasing their levels and items. Their control and ability to cooperate with each other had increased dramatically. It was thanks to Piaro’s teachings, who was an expert in tactics as well as swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit spoke bitterly,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Please stick to the schedule in the future. There will be a big loss if the schedule is out of order.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid listened to him.&nbsp;</span><span style>He and the Overgeared members all had important positions in Reidan. It was too much to delay them with him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid carved that advice into himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will be careful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He has become more mature.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit smiled as he perceived the new changes in Grid.</span><span style>"Anyway, I’m glad that you’re fine. What was the result?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did a mine really exist in Alzar Mountain?</span></p>
 <p><span style>If there was a mine, was it really a yellow mithril mine?&nbsp;</span><span style>Rabbit was full of expectations, and Grid didn’t disappoint him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The mine was secured. As you guessed, it’s a yellow mithril mine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow mithril had appeared in the history of alchemy hundreds of years ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>None of the present day people had witnessed yellow mithril.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Reidan obtained a monopoly on yellow mithril.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a feat that even the empire, which occupied more than half of the territory on the continent, had failed at.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The resulting ripple effect would be huge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You did a great job. Reidan’s future has been obtained.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t an exaggeration.&nbsp;</span><span style>Reidan would be able to establish a unique position with alchemy.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was expected that there would be an explosive synergy with alchemy and the legendary blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a result, Reidan would become the Talima of the human world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go to the meeting room. We need to discuss mine development and the alchemy investment funds."&nbsp;</span><span style>Rabbit said excitedly, but Grid shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m okay. Discuss it with the Overgeared members and proceed on your own.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit already knew that Grid was deliberately avoiding his duties as a lord and didn’t panic.&nbsp;</span><span style>He just felt relief for being trusted, and a burning motivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will do my best to make both of us rich.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The decisive Rabbit moved to the meeting room with the Overgeared members.&nbsp;</span><span style>A small woman was left alone with Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>A female with twin tailed blonde hair, it was Euphemina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You seem to have completed all the work well. Congratulations.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina was tired.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was natural, since she had been working without a break since returning from Frontier with Rabbit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you call me? Do you have something else for me to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were sharp points in Euphemina’s words.&nbsp;</span><span style>It seemed that she wanted to hit him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Grid spoke some surprising words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rest for the moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was confused by Grid’s unexpected words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I know that you’ve been working harder than anyone else over the past few months. Haven’t you gone through a lot since joining the guild? Take some time to recharge and get a good night’s sleep. You can also raise your level, which you have been postponing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is it okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reidan was short-handed compared to the size of the city. In such a situation, it would be a big blow if an elite like Euphemina was to leave.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid laughed at her hesitance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Reidan is quite stable thanks to your work. The experts in each field have been trained, so don’t worry too much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina was moved.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>In retrospect, this was the first time Grid had been so kind to her.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was always chilly and awkward, so this attitude change felt like a reward for her hard work.&nbsp;</span><span style>But that good atmosphere didn’t last for long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I recommend the Siren Kingdom as the hunting ground. While you are there, you should get some of the Water Clan King’s tears.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the moment when Grid’s intentions were revealed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Euphemina’s expression cooled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You want me to go to the Siren Kingdom and get the tears of the water clan king?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The effect of the Water Clan King’s Tears was unrivaled. It was a rare material that permanently gave magic to an item. But it was hard to find.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid once again gave her a mission under the guise of a vacation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'How long must I be abused?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina sighed.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was treated as a princess everywhere she went, but now she was just a worker?&nbsp;</span><span style>She felt skeptical about whether she really should’ve joined the Overgeared Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Grid handed an item to her.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t a robe or a cloak. It was a hooded zip up that could be seen in modern society.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s this?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Euphemina was puzzled by the unfamiliar item and asked Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A gift.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina didn’t show much of a response. She saw the Hooded Zip Up as just a decorative item.&nbsp;</span><span style>But she was shocked as soon as she confirmed the item information.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-Invisibility cloak?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Around 200 years ago, the legendary tailor Kruger made five invisibility cloaks, two of which still reportedly existed. But no one knew where to obtain them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Invisibility cloaks were a super rare system.&nbsp;</span><span style>Euphemina was thrilled by the gift.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will go to the Siren Kingdom!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina once again thought it was good that she joined Overgeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s mood improved as he saw her happiness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Give and take.&nbsp;</span><span style>The joy of a colleague was his joy.&nbsp;</span><span style>The growth of a colleague was his growth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid honestly thought so.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Khan’s smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid opened the pet inventory and pulled out the ‘Doppelganger of the Mysterious Forest.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Crash.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The liquid was reminiscent of molten metal and stretched over the floor without much effort.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid pulled out his hammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Repair it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Wendy’s diary, Pagma had repaired the doppelganger.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the basis of that, Pagma’s Descendant should also be able to repair the doppelganger.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t doubt it. Then he started to repair the doppelganger with the Legendary Blacksmith’s Repair skill Lv. 3.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t easy to repair the doppelganger. He didn’t know the repair method because he had no understanding of the structure of the body. He had no choice but to study it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid believed in himself. To be precise, he believed in the Legendary Blacksmith’s Repair skill. He was sure the skill would lead him correctly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then one hour later.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid finally determined the core and hammered quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your dexterity has risen by 5.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your persistence has risen by 3.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Repair skill has reached level 4.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Doppelganger of the Mysterious Forest has been restored!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The welcome notification windows popped up as the doppelganger started to move.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now it had a slime like appearance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid confirmed the information window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Not Set</span></p>
 <p><span style>Species: Doppelganger</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level: 1 (0/200)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Affinity: 0/100</span></p>
 <p><span style>Health: 1,200/1,200</span></p>
 <p><span style>Physical Attack Power: 15 &nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Attack Power: 2</span></p>
 <p><span style>Defense: 30 &nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Resistance: 6</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attributes: Nothing</span></p>
 <p><span style>Status: Confusion</span></p>
 <p><span style>(Who am I...?)&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>* A doppelganger that existed for over 150 years in the Mysterious Forest. It has accumulated wisdom through human relations and has a lot of combat experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Above all, there is the power to copy the appearance and abilities of the legendary blacksmith Pagma, so it isn’t comparable to normal doppelgangers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Current Skills List-</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Copy Lv. 10 (Mastered)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Can perfectly copy the appearance of a target with a lower level than it. The stats are only 80% copied. Only some skills (random) will be copied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It can completely copy the appearance of a target on the same level as it. The stats are only 50% copied. Only some skills (random) will be copied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Can perfectly copy the appearance of a target with a higher level. The stats are only 20% copied. Only a small number of skills (random) will be copied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perfectly copies the owner’s appearance. The stats are only 30% copied. Only some skills (selected) will be copied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Language Ability Lv. 1]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The language ability is at the level of a five year old child.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Half Immortality (Passive)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Somewhere in the doppelganger’s body, there is a core of life energy. The doppelganger won’t die unless this core is completely destroyed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Wonderful.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was thrilled.&nbsp;</span><span style>The basic stats of the doppelganger at level one were very low compared to Noe, but the Copy skill was excellent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid could use it as a clone that demonstrated 30% of his stats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to take care to raise its level.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid set a policy to treat the doppelganger differently from Noe. If Noe knew, he would be jealous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wh...o?”&nbsp;</span><span style>The doppelganger was confused.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Who am I...? You... Who?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid kindly explained to the doppelganger who was asking questions.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Your name is Randy. And I am Grid. We are friends.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ran...dy. Frie...nds.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was it a remainder of the lost memories?&nbsp;</span><span style>The doppelganger slowly changed to look like a five or six year old girl.&nbsp;</span><span style>She had orange hair and was very cute. She would be beautiful when she was older.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This child is Wendy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s expression darkened.&nbsp;</span><span style>He felt compassion for Randy and Wendy’s unhappy life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Randy. Good name. Friend. Good."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m glad that you like it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Randy smiled very brightly. Grid couldn’t help stroking her hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There might’ve been a sad ending in your past life, but this life will be different.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid decided.&nbsp;</span><span style>He aimed to give Randy happiness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Next...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He needed to strengthen the Doppelganger’s Greatsword and Grid’s Boots in turn.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid took out a large amount of enhancement stones that the Overgeared members had conceded to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'After this preparation, I’ll get revenge for Piaro.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the moment when a new legend in the history of the Saharan Empire would soon be recorded.</span></p>
