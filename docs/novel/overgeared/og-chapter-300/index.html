 <p><span style>[(Combination) Failure + Lifael’s Spear]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Legendary (Transcendent)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: Infinite</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attack Power: 1,100~2,390 &nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 100</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Agility +100</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Divine Power +400</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Fixed damage of +2,200 on each attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a certain probability of activating the ‘Light Wheel’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Attack power +30% against those with black magic power. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a certain probability of blocking the enemy’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a high probability of activating the ‘5 Joint Attacks’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The skill ‘Bisect’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There will be a fear effect if the enemy is more than 15 levels lower than the user.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Attack power +30% in dark places.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A weapon that maximizes the merits of the legendary rated ‘Failure’ and ‘Lifael’s Spear (Reproduction)’ after being combined by the legendary blacksmith G.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Conditions of Use: Pagma’s Descendant</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The combination time is 2 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* This item can’t be traded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Transcendent legendary...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The result was more than expected.&nbsp;</span><span style>The performance of Failure + Lifael’s Spear was close to a mythical weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was safe to say that Item Combination was one of Pagma’s Descendant’s ultimate techniques.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is a pity that the combination time is only 2 minutes.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyway, this battle would be decided within a short amount of time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elfin Stone would either be killed in two minutes, or Grid’s party would be wiped out.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the only outcome now that Blood Field was deployed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid held the golden Failure.&nbsp;</span><span style>He revealed his power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blackening.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Black magic stirred as Grid’s skin became pale and the whites of his eyes turned black.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your black magic power has increased.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You don’t have any black magic power. It will be replaced with demonic power.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[While Blackening is activated, your species will change to half-demon.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[As a half demon, your maximum health is reduced by 50%. Your attack power, magic power and agility will increased by 20% each.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[All attacks will be converted to the black magic attribute.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blackening was a skill that greatly increased his combat related stats in return for half of his maximum health.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid felt strength boiling inside him.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, his status was a little strange.&nbsp;</span><span style>His heart rate elevated and he had an excruciating headache. it was hard to breathe through the pain in his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A notification window popped up the moment Grid felt doubts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your demonic force and divine power of the weapon opposes each other.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The divine power of (Combination) Failure + Lifael’s Spear has doubled the strength of the demonic power.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[All your attacks will have both demonic and divine power at the same time.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Whenever you hit a target with an attack, there is a clash between the demonic power and divine power, causing an explosion.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The demonic power will increase the power of Blackening by devouring the divine power.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Maximum health will drop by 50%. Your attack power, magic power and agility will increased by 10% each.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an obvious mistake.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was so focused on gaining power to overcome the crisis that he didn’t consider the compatibility of Lifael’s Spear and Blackening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ack...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The headache was getting worse.&nbsp;</span><span style>Iyarugt came running at his neck.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Failure’s blade had a small blade reminiscent of a shark’s fin attached to it.&nbsp;</span><span style>It blocked Iyarugt’s sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t intentionally use his swordsmanship, relying on the power of the items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The option effect of (Combination) Failure + Lifael’s Spear has been activated in order to block the enemy’s attack.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A dark explosion occurred at the point where the two swords hit each other.&nbsp;</span><span style>Both Grid and Elfin Stone suffered damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 5,300 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 15,900 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an explosion that contained demonic and divine power.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unlike Grid who had a certain resistance to both attributes and the Holy Light Armor which reduced magic damage, Elfin Stone was vulnerable to divine power and suffered greatly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the result wasn’t good for Grid either.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s maximum health had fallen to 16,000 points, so 5,300 damage was fatal to him. Meanwhile, Elfin Stone’s current health was 4 million. From his standpoint, the damage from the explosion wasn’t that threatening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Elfin Stone didn’t know this about Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He thought Grid intentionally caused the explosion and felt a chill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is this really a human?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A human manifested demonic power and divine power while exerting a physical ability that was comparable to a True Blood earl.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was both transcendent and strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the hell is your identity?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t say anything.&nbsp;</span><span style>To be precise, he had no room to speak.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was barely maintaining his reason with this severe headache.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaah!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was like the roar of a beast.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid approached Elfin Stone and used Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style>The speed and damage wasn’t comparable to the past. It was a tremendous level.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a fearful attack.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elfin Stone moved with all his might and succeeded in evading Kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Dammit!'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone sweated as he barely avoided the attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I felt fear!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was a direct descendant of Shizo Beriache.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Yet he was scared of this unknown human?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can’t tolerate it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Embarrassment boiled inside him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaduduk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone widened the distance with Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>If the two swords collided with each other, there would be an explosion. So he tried to use magic so that he wouldn’t be damaged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a big mistake.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Transcend.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was able to switch to ranged attacks and thus was safe from the explosion that occurred every time the attack hit the distant target.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Explosions kept occurring around Elfin Stone as he was hit by a bombardment of energy blades.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 15,760 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 16,400 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Lifael’s Spear’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘Light Wheel’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 82,900 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The option effect of (Combination) Failure + Lifael’s Spear is activated, causing the skill ‘5 Joint Attacks’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 60,040 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaack!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone let out a horrible shriek.&nbsp;</span><span style>The heavy onslaught and explosion of black light contained a destructive power that even a vampire earl couldn’t ignore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really strong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...It’s terrifying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members were stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style>They might be in the top 20 rankings, the attack power shown by Grid was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Maybe. Maybe this...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, wasn’t Grid comparable to Kraugel?&nbsp;</span><span style>Pon had encountered Kraugel in the past and knew his strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>Just as he was thinking that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit! Shitt!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone started cursing.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t possible to turn to smoke due to the divine power in Grid’s attacks, while Blood Shield couldn’t completely protect his body from the damage of the explosions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In the first place, it was wrong for me to move back!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone belatedly realized and changed his posture.&nbsp;</span><span style>Anyway, it was meaningless to defend so he planned to confront Grid with force.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was both his pride and a wise judgment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone’s scattered blood gathered in one place. Then the blood turned into a spear and shot towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Heart Seeker!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Heart Seeker was a targeted skill that unconditionally hit the target. It was a definite death sentence.&nbsp;</span><span style>The strength surpassed Extreme Blood Transfusion, but Elfin Stone was reluctant to use it because it consumed his health.&nbsp;</span><span style>The fact that Elfin Stone used Heart Seeker meant he recognized that Grid was strong.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kiiiing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was an absolute majesty.&nbsp;</span><span style>The bloody spear penetrated straight through Grid’s bombardment of Transcend and Blacksmith’s Rage.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puoook!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members paled from fear.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid failed to respond to the spear and it pierced his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Red blood poured from Grid’s nose and mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elfin Stone wasn’t careless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He survived the Extreme Blood Transfusion'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Confirmation was necessary.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elfin Stone once again used another spell despite already consuming a large amount of health and magic power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blood Wave!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Blood Wave shot towards Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>A smile appeared on Elfin Stone’s mouth as he confirmed that Grid was about to be hit by it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid used the Skill Deletion of Dark Bus’ Ring and penetrated through Blood Wave to reach Elfin Stone.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elfin Stone tried to hinder Grid by hurriedly deploying Blood Thorn.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid used the left and right movements of Link to avoid most of the thorns coming from the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone shot out Blood Laser.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was blood magic that penetrated through a narrow range.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid waved his hand and destroyed it.&nbsp;</span><span style>He actively utilized Dark Bus’ Ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is nonsense!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone was alarmed by the sight!&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, Grid narrowed down the distance, avoiding Iyarugt with the footwork of Kill. Then he used his best skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Linked Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Both black and gold light shot out like fireworks.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone used Iyarugt to resist the first strike of Linked Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the explosion that occurred afterwards was the problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone shook.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the same with Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elfin Stone was the one who fixed his posture first. It was close, but this difference could be huge in battle.&nbsp;</span><span style>Iyarugt aimed for Grid’s heart.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s immortal passive was activated after Heart Seeker, so this was a tremendous crisis from Grid’s standpoint.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can’t lose after coming this far.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t give up. He might die but he continued to use Linked Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style>And he received a reward for this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The option effect of (Combination) Failure + Lifael’s Spear is activated, causing the skill ‘Light Wheel’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a skill that unfolded at an exquisite moment.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to that, Linked Kill’s thrust quickly changed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elfin Stone exposed a gap after aiming Iyarugt at Grid, and was wounded instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 304,600 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Unbelievable!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The magic sword Iyarugt made the wearer into a master of swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style>But what was this sword technique?&nbsp;</span><span style>Elfin Stone staggered from the shock and was struck by the third consecutive Linked Kill.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 119,400 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Next was the fourth blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 122,000 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the fifth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Holy Light Gloves’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘5 Joint Attacks’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 608,500 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sixth blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Holy Light Gloves’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘5 Joint Attacks’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Lifael’s Spear’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘Light Wheel’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 3,054,900 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s sword kept striking at Elfin Stone.&nbsp;</span><span style>The explosion that occurred every time also landed on Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid wore Doran’s Ring and took a supreme health potion, but the amount of recovery couldn’t keep up with the damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk...! Kuock!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His love, Leah.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elfin Stone recalled the last time he saw her smiling face and scattered into black smoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have died.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid also turned into a grey light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Vampire Earl Elfin Stone is forced to sleep after exhausting all his powers.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your party leader Grid has died.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Pavranium Expedition has acquired Elfin Stone’s Ring.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Pavranium Expedition has acquired Iyarugt.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Pavranium Expedition has acquired the 4th Piece of ???.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Pavranium Expedition has become the first party to capture a vampire city!]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Pavranium Expedition party members will receive bonus experience points and increased item acquisition rate in all vampire cities for the next month.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many notification windows popped up.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid’s vision was turning black so he had no way to verify it.</span></p>
