 <p><span style>Chapter 207</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>After the banquet ended.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid and the Overgeared Guild returned to the north.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? All your stats have risen by 120?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Tzedakah Guild admired the effect of the Kingdom's Hero title.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the case of rankers, they had at least seven different types of stats. Assuming that all stats +120 were applied to all seven, it was similar to gaining 84 levels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, it’s almost a legendary title."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A hero of a kingdom would naturally be recorded in history, and they will eventually become a legend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aww... I wish we had joined the war a little sooner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m envious. It’s amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The former Tzedakah Guild members regretted that they didn’t get the title because they arrived late to the battlefield.&nbsp;</span><span style>They never even imagined it.&nbsp;</span><span style>The fact that the legendary class Grid currently had 13 types of stats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I want to boast about it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was stiff. He wanted to brag to the about members about gaining ‘1,560 stat points!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to be careful.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was determined not to act childishly in the future.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the right judgment as the leader of the Overgeared Guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don’t want to make the guild members feel bad.’ </span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid learned how to care for others the more mature he became.&nbsp;</span><span style>He barely suppressed his childish nature and changed the topic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sehee, what happened to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had just started Satisfy, so he was curious about how she obtained the Saintess class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It is...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee was sulky for some reason, so Yerim explained on behalf of her.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid listened to the story before laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s just like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sacrificing herself to save others without any benefit?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was difficult for Grid to understand Sehee. He was worried that someone would take advantage of her good nature. But he was proud of Sehee. His sister could be as kind as she wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was smiling warmly when Yerim asked him a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"By the way Oppa. I also got the hidden class called Saintess’ Knight? How do I change to it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid and the other guild members were shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style>Both Sehee and Yerim got a hidden class at level 1?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is this good luck?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>'If I stay with Grid, I might open the good luck stat in reality...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It was good that I bought land next to Grid’s building... I should move to South Korea as soon as possible.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel’s complexion rapidly brightened as the guild members gossiped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Sexy Schoolgirl seemed useless, but that was a mistake. Great.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laeul came forward.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Let me explain. The conditions are different for each class change but generally...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Lauel’s help, Yerim was able to change to the Saintess’ Knight class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this good?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Saintess’ Knights had lower base abilities compared to other epic classes. The performance of the newly opened stats were moderate to low, and the power and function of the active skills were too plain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the passive skills were admirable.&nbsp;</span><span style>If she was in a party with the Saintess, the performance of all skills rose by 20%, stats rose by 30% and her resistance increased by 50%. In addition, her defense increased by 40% of the Saintess’ defense.&nbsp;</span><span style>It seemed to be an upgraded version of Huroi’s second class, Apostle of Justice’s Partner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Both of you should stick together in the game.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy would deepen the friendship between the two girls.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was very proud that Sehee had such a good best friend.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because he recently became aware of how important the existence of friends was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before they knew it, the party reached the junction between Winston and Bairan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel pointed out Jishuka.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Jishuka, you should say goodbye here. Please rule Bairan as you have been doing so far.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka responded in a frustrated manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shouldn’t I be near Grid to help him? Can’t I leave Bairan to someone else and go with him to Reidan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you think there are any guild members who can rule a city like Bairan as well as you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka was the only guild member who had proven their ability to manage a territory.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had to depend on Jishuka, who was an experienced person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The guild members will begin to rule over small villages and gain experience as a lord. Then your successor can be decided, so please endure until then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style> “...Yes.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t forget to accumulate minerals in the guild’s warehouse while steadily doing the Guardian of the Forest raid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka elected three guild members to help her and was about to leave with a bleak expression.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Lauel offered something that interested her.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Do you want to swear a knight’s oath to Grid before leaving? Then Grid can summon you anytime he needs you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I-Is that so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She could fly to Grid’s side no matter how far away she was.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka was enthusiastic and pledged to Grid without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have become the knight of Duke Grid of the Eternal Kingdom.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Grid can summon you to his side at any time, assuming that you agree.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hehe, then I’ll be going.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka finally regained her energy and headed towards Bairan with the three guild members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel added something.&nbsp;</span><span style>“In addition, keep searching for talent in Bairan. Please gather three great knights each. In addition, don’t neglect the recruitment of soldiers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The knights and soldiers would become Grid’s power.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka remembered this point and nodded while leaving.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the rest of the guild members headed to Winston with Grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Dear husband!”&nbsp;</span><span style>Irene met Grid’s group as they arrived in Winston. She didn’t care about other people’s eyes as she fell into Grid’s arms.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Thank you for being safe! Thank you for helping my father! Thank you for protecting the kingdom! I’m so proud that you have become a duke!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene’s face was filled with love as she buried it into his chest without hesitation.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid stroked her silver hair with a gentle expression before looking back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee and Yerim were staring at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why do they look so angry?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wondered as he introduced Irene to Sehee and Yerim.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is my wife.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee and Yerim already knew that Grid was a married man in Satisfy. It was natural since his father-in-law was Marquis Steim.&nbsp;</span><span style>But they felt strange and uncomfortable when they directly saw the woman who was Grid’s wife.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Our parents are unaware that he is a married man... He’s a completely bad person.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I want to win Youngwoo oppa first.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene confirmed that the girls were looking at her with hostility and spoke with an uneasy expression.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Dear husband, have you obtained concubines as soon as you became a duke? My heart hurts...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t like that. They are...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no time for Grid to explain. Sehee and Yerim cried out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"W-Who is Oppa’s concubine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not Youngwoo oppa’s concubine. I will be his legal wife!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was quite a big disturbance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee was confused about what was happening, while Yerim blatantly spoke Irene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, this is a game world, not reality. So Oppa and I can get married. I don’t want that, but if Oppa asks me... Uh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are Youngwoo oppa’s wife with that body? Bah, did you use magic?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh my, oh my. What nonsense is this fox speaking?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m tired.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid sighed and suddenly checked the time.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was 7 p.m. in reality.&nbsp;</span><span style>It had been 6 hours in reality and 18 hours in Satisfy time since the kan jajang arrived.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid separated the two girls from Irene and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You guys should log out. Even if it’s Saturday, your parents will worry if you go home late.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many events had occurred since connecting to the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>There was the battle with the golem army, the banquet, the journey, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to that, the girls hadn’t been paying attention to the time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s already this time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girls belatedly realized the situation and prepared to log out.&nbsp;</span><span style>But before they logged out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Today's money, I’ll give it to Oppa.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Me too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee and Yerim were only 18 years old this year. For them, 500,000 gold was a huge sum of money. Then what about 500 million won? It was an amount they couldn’t handle. It made them scared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid understood their minds and received the 442,900 gold that Sehee received from the ‘Fight the Golems’ quest. However, he refused Yerim’s money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’ll take care of Sehee’s money and return it when she is an adult. But Yerim, this is your money. If you want, then I’ll exchange it for cash and give it to your parents.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yerim stuck out her tongue.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Oppa, why are you acting like this? Please take my money. Then at a later time, make me an item with that money. I heard from the guild members that the items you make are expensive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel prompted the hesitant Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Take it. Please manage Ruby and Sexy Schoolgirl’s capital for a while until they level up. Then make them items. It’s also good for the guild.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eventually, Grid nodded.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee and Yerim confirmed it and logged out.&nbsp;</span><span style>The mood finally stabilized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Irene, I will need to go away for a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene looked sad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"... Are you leaving for Reidan straight away?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tears filled her beautiful eyes. She didn’t want to be separated from him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid ached as he watched Irene, who was like a wet puppy in the rain, but it couldn’t be helped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Someday we will be able to travel together.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene wanted to tell Grid not to leave. Or she wanted to follow him.&nbsp;</span><span style>But she had a role to play as the heir of a marquis, and Grid was in a difficult position because he just became a duke.&nbsp;</span><span style>Things might change in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Before you leave, let me feel your love for the last time.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Irene held Grid tightly. She didn’t care about the eyes of the soldiers, knights and guild members as she kissed Grid and declared.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I want to conceive a child with you today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Speaking such an explicit remark in public?&nbsp;</span><span style>The embarrassed Grid blushed while everyone else shifted their gaze as they coughed or whistled.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Irene’s eyes didn’t shake at all. She was serious.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was spellbound by her heart and beauty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand. I will do my best today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that.&nbsp;</span><span style>The two people headed to the bedroom and shared a hot and precious time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s large and thick fingers moved over Irene’s silky skin...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The details will be omitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ahh, dear husband...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid went deeper than ever...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Omitted.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I will move.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Grid and Irene were busy, Lauel headed towards the dungeon.&nbsp;</span><span style>Shay’s party was contained there.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel made a suggestion to the people who had already been trapped in prison for three days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give me the most expensive item you have. Then I'll guarantee your freedom and safety.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shay snorted.&nbsp;</span><span style>“We will be released after three hours, so why should we?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi’s situation in the past was a special case. Normally, no matter how big the crime, a user couldn’t be locked up in prison for more than three days.&nbsp;</span><span style>Shay’s group knew this better than anyone, so they laughed at Lauel’s suggestion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel looked at them coldly.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I will make it easier for you to understand. I will kill you if you don’t pass me an item. If you have eyes and ears, you should already know that I have that power.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>PK users like Shay’s party had a high probability of dropping items when they died.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel looked at their frightened expression and pulled out a list. It was the list that Irene gave him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is a list of items that you currently own. Give me your most expensive and precious item. Then I will spare your lives.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T-This...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shay’s party thought it was ridiculous.&nbsp;</span><span style>This young man called Lauel, he was as evil as them, who had threatened so many people?&nbsp;</span><span style>Once again, Shay’s party vowed not to mess with Grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Grid spent precious time with Irene before calling for Euphemina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you remember Rabbit?”&nbsp;</span></p>
