 <p><span style>Chapter 225</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Finally! Finally level 300!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been four months since the Overgeared Guild moved to Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban was the last member of the former Tzedakah Guild to reach level 300.&nbsp;</span><span style>The powerful monsters of the west stimulated their growth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There will be a cataclysm in the unified rankings.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cataclysm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The top seven have firmly maintained their rankings but... I can safely say that most of the top 40 rankings are dominated by the Overgeared members.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why is that a cataclysm? It isn’t anything special.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, all of the Tzedakah Guild members were ranked in the top 50. The average ranking had only risen by 10, so Grid thought it wasn’t that big of a deal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is rather strange that no one has entered the top seven, despite the items I made.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid might be disappointed, but the world was astonished.&nbsp;</span><span style>The top 100 rankings didn’t fluctuate easily, so the present growth rate of the Overgeared members was unprecedented.&nbsp;</span><span style>Media companies around the world wondered ‘What secrets are hidden in Reidan that can allow them to grow so quickly?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 The reporters have failed to enter the west. 』&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 In the western part of the Eternal Kingdom, there are monsters that have never been seen before. Experts speculate that only a party of at least level 280 users or rankers can enter... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『It seems like the Overgeared members are raising their level quickly by hunting the powerful monsters in the west. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Um... The monsters in the west will be a double-edged sword to the Overgeared Guild. The level up speed of the Overgeared members has risen exponentially, but there are few users who can move to Reidan due to the high entry barriers. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 That’s right. Reidan’s speed of development will be slow. Duke Grid will definitely be hurt. 』</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There was the constant sound of hammering from the large smithy in Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>The 30 young blacksmiths taught by Khan were constantly producing the supplies that Reidan needed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m tired.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was still busy despite the manpower increasing.&nbsp;</span><span style>After their third advancement class, the Overgeared members commissioned more powerful items, so he needed to continue making items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But this damn hammering will be over soon.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He only had five commissions left. Grid was free after he made those five items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Let’s plan for the future.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had personal challenges.&nbsp;</span><span style>The first was to complete his class quest, the second was to recover all the pavranium, and the third was to complete Piaro’s quest.&nbsp;</span><span style>His work as a lord?&nbsp;</span><span style>He had the incomparably clever Lauel and Rabbit to take care of it, so there were no problems.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You over there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid stopped hammering and called out to a soldier guarding the entrance of the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Did you call?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldier ran over with tight discipline.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The great duke called me!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldier’s eyes shone like lanterns as Grid ordered.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Bring Minor here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After 30 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh, what do you want?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>A boy with a disgruntled expression came to the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite possessing the talents of a great miner, he was fostered as a ‘minerals detector’ because he possessed the skill ‘Minerals Master (S+).</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will give you an escort to search for the presence of the golem’s labyrinths here in the west.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It isn’t an escort, but surveillance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someday, I will give you freedom if you swear true allegiance to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Well, I do acknowledge you these days. You’re a commoner who became a duke. But I’m still wondering if a genius like me should devote the rest of my life to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Minor possessed the skill ‘Talent will Reveal Itself (SS).’&nbsp;</span><span style>His talent would always be clear to others, so he was destined to receive a lot of temptations in life.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was arrogant and would easily betray a person, so his loyalty wasn’t guaranteed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it lacking to be the subordinate of a duke?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Indeed. At a minimum, shouldn’t it be a king?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoh... You should remember that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid would surely become a king and would obtain him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid pledged as he waved his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, yes."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Minor gave an insincere answer.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid knew better than anyone that he would work properly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The problem if searching for pavranium in the west is resolved...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only things left were the class quest and Piaro’s revenge quest.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, he couldn’t proceed with his class quest right now. It was impossible for Grid to get God Yatan to bless the pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Even Yura doesn’t knew where the First Servant of the Yatan Church is... First, I should resolve Piaro’s grudge.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cause of Piaro’s heart sickness, Asmophel.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Grid defeated the former vice-captain of the Red Knights, Piaro could be freed from these chains.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Once he is in a perfect condition, he might become my subordinate...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hopeful Grid continued making items.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then five items later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid completely all the items for the guild members and used the skill the Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Legendary Blacksmith’s Creation Skill]</span></p>
 <p><span style>You can create three equipment item production methods every time the skill level of the ‘Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill’ goes up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number of items that can be created at present: 12/15.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* When items are produced using this skill, the name of the creator is automatically placed on the item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the familiar notification windows started to emerge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[What item do you want to create?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Heavy boots.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Have you decided on ‘Heavy Boots?’]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[What materials would you like to use?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Um...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He shouldn’t use only high grade minerals such as black iron, mithril and blue orichalcum as materials.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reason Grid wanted to make heavy boots was because he wanted weight.&nbsp;</span><span style>According to Piaro’s advice, the heavier the shoes worn, the greater the power of the greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The main material will be steel. I will mix blue orichalcum into it to add strength and hardness, and to make it exert more power in dark places. Ah, I have to make the color darker by mixing in black iron so that it will harmonize with my armor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Have you decided?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Please design the item.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was a lot more smart and skillful compared to when he first created Failure.&nbsp;</span><span style>He perfectly drew the shape of the boots he wanted on the blank blueprint in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s done.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Over the past four months, he made more than 600 items and his dexterity stat exceeded 3,000 points.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to that, Grid was able to draw a delicate image and the shape of the boots was completed in a practical and excellent manner.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were big, black boots that came up to just below the knees. They had a rustic type of beauty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Have you decided? When you complete the blueprint, the number of available creation skill will decrease by one.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid clicked the button without hesitation.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the shape of the boots was corrected by the system to make it look more perfect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Please describe the characteristics of the item.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Heavy and solid boots. Thanks to the nature of blue orichalcum, the defense will increase in dark places.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a simple, but accurate description.&nbsp;</span><span style>Based on Grid’s description, the system started distributing the performance and options of the item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Finally, please decide the name of the item.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>From now on, all the items he created would proudly boast of the legendary blacksmith who created them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid replied in a proud voice,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Grid’s Boots.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Have you decided on ‘Grid’s Boots?’]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid planned to attach his name to every item he designed in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I will aim to complete a set item based on these boots.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A new item, ‘Grid’s Boots’ have been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Grid’s Boots]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Epic ~ Legendary</span></p>
 <p><span style>Epic Rating Information:</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 335/335 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense: 324</span></p>
 <p><span style>Movement Speed: -12%</span></p>

 <p><span style>* When using a dashing skill, there is a 20% chance of failure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Defense will increase by 20% in dark places.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An item designed by a legendary blacksmith. Designed with a perfect combination of steel, black iron and blue orichalcum, it boasts overwhelming defense.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, there are many disadvantages to its function because it is only focused on defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In particular, it is too heavy, so movement is restricted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>User Restriction: Level 320 or higher. More than 1,450 strength. More than 1,200 stamina. Advanced Heavy Armor Mastery Level 5 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 2,930</span></p>
 <p><span style>The effectiveness was very low compared to Braham’s Boots.&nbsp;</span><span style>It could be considered to be boots designed specifically for tanker classes, rather than damage dealers who relied on charging techniques.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the defense was nearly twice as strong as armor of the same class. The defense was unusually high for boots, considering that boots had a quarter of the defense of armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is perfect for me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the first place, Grid didn’t have a evasive type of fighting style. He favored swinging the sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t just a matter of control, but a style unique to the greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Furthermore, Grid had no charging skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The boots won’t have any negative effect on me, except for a reduction in movement speed. These boots will also suit Vantner and Toban.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was satisfied with the finished creation.&nbsp;</span><span style>He dreamed that one day, both him and the Overgeared members would be armed with a ‘Grid set,’ and started to make an item for himself.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The skills of a legendary blacksmith was constantly studied by 30 young blacksmiths and Khan, so the future was bright.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>It had been a year since the fall of Pope Drevigo.&nbsp;</span><span style>Who would become the new pope after Drevigo?&nbsp;</span><span style>Numerous senior priests ran as pope candidates.&nbsp;</span><span style>Most of them were good priests and had a sense of mission to lead 70 million people to the path of light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, a small number of them wanted to be the pope to satisfy their individual needs.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, Pascal of the Judar Church was very ambitious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What if I became the master of 70 million people? The momentum of our family will pierce the sky and Father will surely become a duke.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal’s father was an earl of the Saharan Empire. Originally Pascal was a viscount, but he joined the church and became the leader of the Judar Church. Now he was looking at a higher place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand. Pascal, I will help you become the pope.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The largest religion on the continent was on the verge of falling into the hands of the empire.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this time, the 70 million people who followed Goddess Rebecca’s teachings might become a political tool of the empire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isabel-chan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first unique hidden class, Damian, was trembling with sorrow.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because Isabel’s life was sharply decreasing after the unsealing of Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
