 <p>"..."</p>
 <p><span style>It was the first time Grid saw such bad acting.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was even more awkward than an idol appearing in a drama for the first time. Anybody watching it would be embarrassed.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the acting wasn’t the important thing right now.&nbsp;</span><span style>What was he planning after claiming to be enchanted?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had no doubt that Toban was lying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Interesting.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban’s greed was awakened due to the quest, and now he was trying to betray a colleague.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Box said with satisfaction,&nbsp;</span><span style>“The situation is like this... Grid, I want to experience the skill of the hidden class that smashed the Giant Guild. Chief, use buff magic on us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This isn’t right.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban hesitated until the end.&nbsp;</span><span style>It might be for a quest, but he was worried and feeling guilty about betraying a fellow guild member.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'It goes against logic.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew it. No matter the reason, he shouldn’t betray a colleague. He couldn’t refute, even if he was called garbage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>But he didn’t want to give up this quest.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was a SS-grade quest that he received for the first time, with a legendary rated sword as a reward.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an opportunity that wouldn’t come again, so he couldn’t miss it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After careful consideration, Toban made his decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m sorry Grid... But this is all your fault! You are a bad person!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Can’t you give up the quest items for a guild member? He wasn’t even asking for free, since he was willing to pay compensation. But it was rejected? Was that too much to ask?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid! I have to kill you for the quest! I will surely repay the damage that you will suffer today!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Toban decided!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He started acting again,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Ah! How is this possible? My body has to move as Box commands and now I am using a skill? I want to reject it, but I can’t! This! It can’t be helped. I’m sorry, Grid! Forgive me! God of health and wisdom, Judar! I earnestly pray for you to give us your blessing. Light’s Glory!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The effect of Light’s Glory is activated. The stats of you and your party members have increased by 20%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Paladins of the Judar Church were specialized in buff skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>Not only was their buffing ability superior, the buff effect extended to all party members, including the pets. Therefore, the Judar paladins were one of the most popular classes for party hunting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let's start again. Show us all of your abilities.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Asuka felt stronger and restarted the battle with Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Spear Frenzy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Berserkers were more aggressive than any other class and could use all types of weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asuka was a second generation conglomerate heir, so she had a variety of unique weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style>She pulled out a spear from her inventory and started a crazy rampage.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Sword Frenzy was a single target skill, while Spear Frenzy was a skill with a wide range.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The spear attacked the target and surrounding area at the same time. It inflicted 50% damage to enemies within the attack range, causing the ground to shake and for the target to rise in the air for 0.8 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if the target avoided the attack, they couldn’t avoid the aftermath.&nbsp;</span><span style>The so-called CC (crowd control) technique. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wielded his greatsword to stop the spear. However, his body was affected by the aftermath.&nbsp;</span><span style>He started to rise in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asuka didn’t miss this gap.&nbsp;</span><span style>She had countless combat experience so she rushed to complete the combo.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was possible to damage someone in the air using ‘Chain Frenzy.’ This would cause the opponent to hang helplessly in the air for two seconds and receive one-sided attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She pulled out the chain, but Grid wasn’t stuck in the air.&nbsp;</span><span style>He stood on the ground like a magnet was attached to his feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Resorting to petty tricks.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid grinned at the panicked Asuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asuka hurriedly retrieved the chain. Then she pulled out the double swords she used as a main weapon and defended.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>'It is still fast and heavy!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>All her stats had increased by 20%. Nevertheless, Grid still felt strong.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kikik!</span></i> <i><span style>Kkikikik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘Amazing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asuka’s face was blissful instead of fearful as she blocked the greatsword with her double swords.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He’s immune to CC. Is this man’s class immune to status conditions?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t this a fraudulent effect that would collapse the balance?&nbsp;</span><span style>She earnestly started to covet it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asuka wanted the same hidden class as Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>She would pay Grid astronomical amounts of money to find out how to obtain his class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t care about money. She believed that she could get anything she wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But what was the reality?&nbsp;</span><span style>Most users didn’t know this, but the way to change to a hidden class changed every moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to change to class A, three loaves of bread needed to be eaten three times in front of a certain place. This condition wasn’t always constant. Depending on the person and situation, they might have to shout four times or eat four loaves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hidden class was obtained once every condition was met, and it could change depending on luck and coincidences.&nbsp;</span><span style>Think about it. If the method of obtaining a hidden class was fixed, wouldn’t a hidden class sell the method for money and it would become commonplace?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only possible to buy a class change book, not the actual method.&nbsp;</span><span style>And in the first place, Grid had a legendary class.&nbsp;</span><span style>A legendary class was unique.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It was useless even for a billionaire.&nbsp;</span><span style>As long as Grid was Pagma's Descendant, no one else could become Pagma's Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid sensed the presence of the white bear warrior while dealing with Grid, and used the skill that smashed the Giant Guild members in the past.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asuka and the white bear warrior, who were in front and behind Grid, both flew away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 4,500 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was tremendous attack power.&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite her unique rated armor, Asuka lost a quarter of her health from the attack. Then warning windows flashed in front of her amazed eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Due to the enemy’s skill, all speeds have decreased for 10 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The wide area skill deals large damage and has a debuff effect?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was also immune to status conditions, so the category of Grid’s class must be beyond common sense.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asuka was sure of it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t have a rare hidden class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is still one epic class still undisclosed... Is that you?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Asuka asked Grid like she knew everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Think what you want.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was about to attack again when Asuka cried out,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Let me know how to obtain your hidden class. In exchange, I will give you enough money to play around for the rest of your life...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment that Asuka was about to negotiate, Box jumped forward and blocked her mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Miss Asuka, don’t you want to have some more fun?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After speaking one-sidedly, Box opened his folding fan and started to wield it like a baton. It was a weapon that controlled magic power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'This parasitic bastard.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A handsome man was humming while swinging his fan around like a maestro. He was handsome so anything he did would become a painting.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was feeling a strong animosity when Box stopped his conducting.&nbsp;</span><span style>In less than two seconds, he used a skill to connect the magic power of himself and his party members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Magic Power Resonance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The effect of Magic Power Resonance is activated. The buff effect applied to you and your party members will increase by 1.5 times.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Linkers weren’t just about puppet magic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It could amplify beneficial effects and extent the range of the effect. The same was true for harmful effects.&nbsp;</span><span style>If the enemy had a debuff on them, he could extend the debuff range by connecting his magic power to the enemy’s and amplifying the effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Linkers belonged to the magician class by default. They also had attack magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Magic Pistol."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tatatang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Box fired his magic power like he was holding a gun.&nbsp;</span><span style>The damage was low but the activation speed was so fast it was almost impossible to avoid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid couldn’t respond and was hit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 307 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 315 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Holy Light Armor was light armor. But it was made of the god mineral adamantium and had a higher defense than level 250 unique rated heavy armor. The defense was 872 points. It could be considered as one of the best armors in existence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t meet the conditions of use and with the penalty, only 393 defense was applied. It was around the same level of defense as a level 200 rare rated heavy armor.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the Holy Light Armor had a fraudulent option of 40% reduction in physical damage and 50% reduction in magic damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, the set effect of the Holy Light Battle Gear gave +500 defense so the default defense wasn’t low.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t even blink despite being hit with Magic Pistol one after another.&nbsp;</span><span style>Box was surprised and covered half his face with his fan. It was to cover as much of his confusion as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Magic Pistol only did 300 damage? The damage of a linker is weak, but isn’t this too much?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, hadn’t his stats increased by 30% due to the combined effect of Light’s Glory and Magic Power Resonance? Yet he only did this much damage?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is more than I imagined.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In general, classes with excellent attack power had low defense.&nbsp;</span><span style>Box predicted that Grid would have low defense.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then what was this? Grid seemed to have uniquely high attack power and defense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s a class with a perfect balance... No, that’s too much. It might be his items. Perhaps the battle gear that Toban considered as simple quest items are actually amazing? Okay. First of all, let’s stay calm.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how high his defense, he wouldn’t have infinite health.&nbsp;</span><span style>Box thought he would be able to kill Grid if this continued.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he used magic again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Magic Pistol."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tatatang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 290 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 310 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 305 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The advantage of Magic Pistol wasn’t just its activation speed. The mana consumption was low, so he could use it freely.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s nerves were sharpened by the magic power bullets that continued to fly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'This is irritating.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The damage wasn’t threatening. Currently, Grid was level 170 and had a health that was close to 40,000. This included the 6,000 health acquired from the Holy Light set and Doran’s ring. 300 damage was like a mosquito biting him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But what if the damage continued to accumulate?&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t overlook the attacks that were impossible to avoid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid decided that Box should be removed first. But the white bear warrior blocked his path to Box.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was also Toban behind the bear.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the 1st ranked paladin, so he was famous for his iron wall defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Box believed that the current battle formation was perfect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Black Teddy’s summons and Toban will tie up Grid’s feet, while I deal damage from the rear. Asuka will look for a gap and deal the fatal blow.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The opponent might be a monster who killed the pope, but they were four top rankers and the balance was excellent. It was a fight that was virtually impossible to lose. Victory was natural.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban and Box’s group thought so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Grid thought differently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I am stronger than Pon or Regas.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He alone defeated the pope, who was even stronger than Malacus.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid believed that with the pavranium, he was the strongest user.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s right. Grid had the pavranium.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He finally pulled out the pavranium.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would use all his strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First of all, take care of the annoying guy...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is that?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Box’s companions were amazed as two golden discs suddenly appeared.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kiiiiing!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The discs turned like cogs and rose into the sky. They easily flew through Toban’s defense on the ground, like they were laughing at him. After descending again, they hit Box’s chest, who was stunned and fell down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>These discs flew alone and attacked the enemy? What type of absurd item was this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Toban, what is that? Did he have something like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While everyone was focused on the golden discs, Grid unfolded his sword dance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Transcend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Subsequently, he used Blacksmith’s Rage and greatly increased his attack power and attack speed. After that, he launched the energy swords at Toban and Black Teddy’s pet.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuoong!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban used a defense buff and hurriedly raised his shield in front of him. But it was useless. His epic rated shield was turned into scrap metal in front of the bombardment.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban felt like crying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Grid. Why are you so strong?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka, Pon and Vantner told him that Grid was actually a very talented person, but he never imagined a class like this.&nbsp;</span><span style>If this continued, wouldn’t they lose the battle?</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Isn’t this too disgraceful...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Death would cause a loss in experience.&nbsp;</span><span style>As Toban was feeling desperate, Asuka spoke with admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On one side, Box was being hit by the two golden discs, as they constantly flew past Toban and Black Teddy’s defense.&nbsp;</span><span style>This wasn’t a battle between rankers.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was like a high level user playing with low level users.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was completely one-sided.</span><span style>However, the situation might change if the main damage dealer, Asuka joined in again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a berserker, she became stronger the more health she lost. She lost a quarter of her health to Grid’s strike, so she had a 20% increase in attack power and 10% increase in attack speed due to the passive effect. She was confident that she could face Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Asuka made another choice.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was fascinated the more she watched Grid’s class, so she cried out,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Grid! Let me know how to obtain your hidden class! I will provide you with a large amount of money, enough for you to play around for the rest of your life!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could live a comfortable life for some game information.&nbsp;</span><span style>Who could resist this temptation?&nbsp;</span><span style>Asuka naturally thought that Grid would cooperate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Grid’s ears pricked up.&nbsp;</span><span style>He stopped the bombardment and asked Asuka,&nbsp;</span><span style>"How much are you going to give?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Tell me the amount you want.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid spoke to her confidently.&nbsp;</span><span style>"One trillion won.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t 100 billion, but one trillion?&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t the type of money that even a second generation heir would have. One trillion won was an astronomical amount equivalent to one-thirds of her father’s company’s assets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you crazy?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid sincerely questioned Asuka.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Is there something wrong with your head?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could a hidden class be sold so easily?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is something called a brain. Do you think the class change method is the same every time? If it could be told to anyone, would the hidden classes be as rare as they are now? They would be as common as stones on the street.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>She listened to him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid scoffed as Asuka made a stunned expression after realizing what she had overlooked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have a lot of money, but you don’t see the world. How stupid.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Right now, Grid was grumpy.&nbsp;</span><span style>"You asked for the method to obtain my hidden class? Attacking people randomly for such absurd reasons...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wanted to clear the quest as quickly as possible and return to Winston.&nbsp;</span><span style>His goal was a first night with his pretty bride! He wanted to return to his daily life after losing his virginity.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was earning money and stats as a blacksmith, then he would embezzle Winston’s taxes once he became a lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet these guys were delaying his journey.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was for items or purely selfish reasons.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was okay to interfere with others, but he couldn’t tolerate others interfering with him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s eyes shone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid underestimated Toban and Box’s group.&nbsp;</span><span style>This carelessness almost caused a big misfortune.&nbsp;</span></p>
