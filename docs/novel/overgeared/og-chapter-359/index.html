 <p><span style>[You have cleared the ninth island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have acquired 24 challenger points for the mission success.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have a total of 102 points.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid reached the ninth island at a fast pace and was still okay. There were no signs of exhaustion at all.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was natural.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t get tired because it wasn’t hard for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s easier than expected.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, Grid felt deflated. But he didn’t become overconfident.&nbsp;</span><span style>Wasn’t the Behen Archipelago the place that caused difficulty for Kraugel?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The difficulty is likely to rise exponentially over the next few islands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid thought this and controlled his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t know.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The endless monsters on the first island, the hidden keys on the second island, capturing the escaped fox mice on the third island, swallowing the raging fire on the fourth island, surviving the blizzard on the fifth island, passing through the poisonous sixth island, the seventh and eighth islands where the strong boss monsters appeared...</span></p>
 <p><span style>And the ninth island that he just cleared...</span></p>
 <p><span style>From a general point of view, they weren’t easy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was the only person who felt like the hell islands were easy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even Kraugel suffered on the first and second islands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Do you want to enter the 10th island?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was sucked into the gate.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The 2nd National Competition was to be held in Paris in around two months.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to that, the employees of the S.A. Group were constantly busy. They ate rice and frequently worked overtime, so they couldn’t stay healthy.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had to coordinate the details before the opening of the global festival.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah, it’s hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Chairman Lim Cheolho, who was more passionate than anyone, was sick.&nbsp;</span><span style>As soon as he returned from Paris, he sat down in his massage chair at work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m too old. No matter how much I manage myself, I quickly become exhausted.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kkuok.</span></i> <i><span style>Kkuok.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The massage chair worked on his shoulders and back, giving a very good effect.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chairman Lim Cheolho properly recovered from his fatigue and asked the supercomputer Morpheus. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"Did anything happen to them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Them.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were the five miracles, including Grid and Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were people who repeatedly caused results that even Morpheus couldn’t predict.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chairman Lim Cheolho watched the five of them with interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before leaving for Paris, he asked Morpheus to monitor them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Morpheus reported with a mechanical voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Kraugel and Grid confronted each other, while Agnus encountered Braham’s soul. The other two are just raising their level.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lim Cheolho doubted his ears.&nbsp;</span><span style>His focus wasn’t on the part about Agnus and Braham.&nbsp;</span><span style>The meeting between the two of them was scheduled, so there was nothing special about it.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Kraugel and Grid were different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you say just now? Kraugel and Grid fought? Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Kraugel visited Reidan after acquiring the Sword Saint quest.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah...! He has the Sword Saint quest already!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel was really amazing.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a player, he was perfect without lacking anything. No, his perfection could be described as transcendental. That’s why even the supercomputer Morpheus couldn’t predict all his actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He will safely become a sword saint.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be easy for him to deal with the relatively weaker Grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sword saint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The most powerful battle focused class.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the future, how much stronger would Kraugel become?&nbsp;</span><span style>Chairman Lim Cheolho’s expectations were amplified.&nbsp;</span><span style>Morpheus spoke unexpected words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Kraugel failed to obtain the sword saint class.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lim Cheolho’s eyes widened with surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It can’t be... Surely he didn’t lose to Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chairman Lim Cheolho knew better than anyone how great Grid’s power was.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t an exaggeration.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lim Cheolho evaluated Grid higher than Grid did himself.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Kraugel was different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, he was an overwhelming presence in PvP. Apart from Agnus, there was no player who could win against Kraugel in a one-on-one match.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Morpheus explained to the confused Lim Cheolho.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Kraugel was incomplete. The cooldown time of an important skill hadn’t recovered yet, and his equipment was damaged, so he didn’t wear all of them against Grid. As a result, Grid’s odds increased from 21.13% to 54.98%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid’s odds were so high from the beginning?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[I analyzed the skill tree, items possessed and accumulated battle data of both people, but I can’t be sure it is accurate. Kraugel has made my analysis meaningless 185 times and Grid 13 times.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was why they were called miraculous beings.&nbsp;</span><span style>A smile appeared on Lim Cheolho’s face and he laughed loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Today is chicken and beer.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lim Cheolho decided to have chicken and beer while watching footage of the match between Kraugel and Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the one with the most assets in the world.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[You have entered the tenth island.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a room rather than an island.&nbsp;</span><span style>The floor, walls, and ceiling were painted white, and the size of the empty room couldn’t be measured.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was hard to get a sense of the distance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid frowned as he looked around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What’s this?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were white pointed pillars rising from the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were thin metal poles around 5cm wide and 2m long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are hundreds... No, thousands?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was the identity of this pillars?&nbsp;</span><span style>A notification window popped up in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A mission will be created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Tenth Island]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Avoid the lightning that will pour down like rain!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lightning can’t be defended against by any means. You can only evade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mission Success Conditions: Reach the gate for the eleventh island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First Clear Reward: 30 Challenger Points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* You will instantly die if hit by a lightning strike.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The mission will start 30 minutes from now.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The ceiling is opened.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kurururung.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Then a roar was heard from above.&nbsp;</span><span style>He looked up and saw the sky that was revealed by the opened ceiling.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a sky full of dark clouds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A lightning storm that can’t be defended against.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lightning storm that would cause instant death would come pouring down.&nbsp;</span><span style>Considering the speed of the lightning, it was a mission that couldn’t be cleared.&nbsp;</span><span style>Only people with excellent control abilities could. For example, people like Kraugel, Regas, and Faker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The difficulty is growing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid finally became nervous.&nbsp;</span><span style>As he was worrying about what to do, he became interested in the pillars that appeared everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They wouldn’t be here for no reason.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Identifying the use of the pillars was a priority.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid approached the pillar closest to him and used a skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Legendary Blacksmith’s Appraisal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Appraisal skill has been used.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The blacksmith who became a legend can appraise items with an excellent discerning eye. If a hidden feature exists in the target item, it will be found.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttiring~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[Lightning Rod]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 1/20</span></p>
 <p><span style>A metal rod with a pointed end that attracts and absorbs lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The durability is weak because it is severely damaged. It will immediately turn to ashes from one lightning strike.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 3</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A hidden function doesn’t exist.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your understanding of the Lightning Rod is now 100%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The ‘Lightning Rod’ production method has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, a lightning rod. I have to use this to avoid the lightning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid grasped the identity of the rods and looked more closely.&nbsp;</span><span style>The distance between lightning rods was around 15m on average.&nbsp;</span><span style>People had to properly utilize their dashing skills to use the lightning rod and avoid the lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Can I do it?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wasn’t in a position to do it with his control skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>He worried for a while before coming up with an idea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s really good that I made this.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The item that Grid took from his inventory was the Portable Furnace that he created.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The number of players who had challenged the Behen Archipelago was exactly 990 so far.&nbsp;</span><span style>More than half of them were high rankers who dropped out at the first and second islands. Only 392 people reached the tenth island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of those 392 people, only 65 passed the tenth island.&nbsp;</span><span style>The degree of difficulty of the tenth island was incomparable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok... Heok...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sweat flowed down Sticks’ jaw as he sat on the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>The burden on his heart was very painful.&nbsp;</span><span style>He took a deep breath and turned his gaze towards the magic ball again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He really won’t pass here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This person stimulated his bad heart, so Sticks couldn’t help giving him a bad evaluation.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sticks could clearly see that the black haired man had a strange ability, but the tenth island was a place where only people with divine control skills could pass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It means he can no longer depend on artifacts.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could that man move 2,000 meters while avoiding lightning that fell three or four times per second?&nbsp;</span><span style>Sticks believed it was impossible.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn't a baseless idea.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unfortunately, that black haired man didn’t seem to be able to perfectly control his excellent body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ordinary movements will never... Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks murmured with confusion.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the middle of the magic space, the man pulled out a portable furnace and started lighting it with the bellows?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it this time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no ‘portable blast furnace’ in Sticks’ wisdom.&nbsp;</span><span style>A furnace couldn’t be easily handled unless the person was a blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the first place...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why bring out a furnace in this situation?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is he crazy?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, it was a problem because he wasn’t crazy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sticks’ confusion increased as the black haired man raised the temperature of the furnace and started to smelt the iron ore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks had a large amount of knowledge as a sage.&nbsp;</span><span style>So he was forced to feel astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? That smelting skill?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black haired man exerted a tremendous smelting skill that completely destroyed the concept of ‘smelting’ that existed in Sticks’ knowledge.&nbsp;</span><span style>The iron was instantly melted and purified.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A legendary blacksmith...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He seemed like a magician when shooting magic, a warrior when wielding the sword, a person with a lot of artifacts, and a thief who could easily open solid locks.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now he was also like a blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s your identity?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A question mark appeared over Sticks’ head.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The mysterious man finished smelting the iron and started hammering it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Soon after that...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lightning rod?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>A metal rod, similar to the lightning rods rising from the ground of the tenth island, was born in the hands of the black haired man.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the size was significant.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a huge 7m in length.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks was no longer surprised. No, he tried not to be surprised. He was afraid that his heart pain would occur again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kururung!</span></i> <i><span style>Kurururung.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a heavy rain of lightning started.&nbsp;</span><span style>The black haired man was safe.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was thanks to the floating golden hands that carried the large lightning rod.&nbsp;</span><span style>The man moved like a noble covered by the umbrella his retinue was holding as he moved through the island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh... Urghh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Sticks was surprised and he grabbed his chest as he collapsed.&nbsp;</span><span style>It didn’t match the appearance of the imposing Grid.</span></p>
