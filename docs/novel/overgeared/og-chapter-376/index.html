 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A haze spread around Grid’s body and there was a faint light as he started a sword dance.&nbsp;</span><span style>The first legendary class in Satisfy demonstrated absolute dominance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Transcended Link.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>20 red-black energy blades filled with strength flooded towards Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>The sight caused the billions of people watching the video to hold their breath.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sururuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel avoided them with minimal movements, neared Grid, and his white sword moved in a curved line.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid defended like he was waiting for it.&nbsp;</span><span style>The camera shook as the two swords hit each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Then it changed to a black and white screen with 2XX3.10.27 on it.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style>It was the opening video that announced the date and time of the 2nd National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Great.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>It’s cool, really cool.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>The opening of a game should taste like this.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Something is bubbling up inside me.</span></i> <i><span style>It’s much cooler than the Demon Hero movies.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Everybody has different tastes ^^. I prefer the Demon Hero movies.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The public’s interest in the opening video of the 2nd National Competition was hot.&nbsp;</span><span style>Among them, the Korean people were enthusiastic about the existence of Yura and Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Yura and Peak Sword are in position with the Overgeared members.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>When did they join Overgeared?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>There is continuous breaking news.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-Wow...</span></i> <i><span style>I never imagined that Yura and Peak Sword would join Overgeared.</span></i> <i><span style>Grid’s forces seem truly unique.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-It is likely that there are eight main guilds in Satisfy now, not seven.</span></i> <i><span style>The existing seven guilds and Overgeared.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-Isn’t Peak Sword the master of the Silver Knights?</span></i> <i><span style>Did the Silver knights merge with Overgeared?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>It’s likely.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>We can think of Overgeared as a Korean guild.</span></i> <i><span style>Their master is Korean and most of the guild members are Korean.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-Kya ~ ~!</span></i> <i><span style>Do you know Overgeared?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Hah...</span></i> <i><span style>Yura and Jishuka are really pretty.</span></i> <i><span style>I will have no other wishes in my life if I can meet them once once.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>No, it’s absurd to get both of them </span></i><span style>ㅡㅡ </span><i><span style>Choose one of the two</span></i><span style>ㅡㅡ</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>He’s even a couple in the game with Irene. Ah, I’m so envious.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>People can get everything if they are successful in their field.</span></i> <i><span style>I will try my best when it comes to writing comments on the Internet as well. ^^</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Then I guess I only have Satisfy from now on.</span></i> <i><span style>I will be like Grid and buy an 800 million won car.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I’ve been only playing Satisfy since it opened, but I’m still level 250 ㅎㅎㅎ. I can’t be Grid.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Fun.</span></i> <i><span style>The users with levels above 250 should comment here.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The dignity of Grid and Overgeared were clearly communicated to the Korean people.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Lauel’s intention.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, contrary to Lauel’s intentions, the people of other countries were concentrating on something else.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>-Wow...</span></i> <i><span style>Kraugel will participate in the competition.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Yes.</span></i> <i><span style>I thought he would stick to the mysterious concept for the rest of his life.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>It isn’t a mysterious concept. He just focuses on levelling up to the end.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I wonder why Kraugel is participating in the tournament?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Of course, he must covet the prizes.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Now that Grid’s reputation is growing to a level that can threaten him, his pride means he has come to show the difference in skill.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Indeed...</span></i> <i><span style>Kraugel is in a different class.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-What are you saying </span></i><span style>ㅡㅡ </span><i><span style>Grid has shown many times what he can achieve, their classes are too different.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>What nonsense. Don’t you see how easily Kraugel avoided Grid’s skill?</span></i><i><span style>Kraugel is a wall.</span></i> <i><span style>I don’t mean to ignore Grid, but Kraugel is too great.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>What are you saying?</span></i> <i><span style>How do you know Kraugel managed to avoid Grid’s skill?</span></i> <i><span style>You can’t distinguish between reality and directing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>You don’t believe Kraugel’s skills?</span></i> <i><span style>In the old days, rankers shot videos of Kraugel hunting and his control ability exceeded common sense.</span></i> <i><span style>Search on Mytube.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Ah, that video...</span></i> <i><span style>It had over a billion hits.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel’s face distorted as he confirmed the public’s reaction.&nbsp;</span><span style>Public interest was focused on Grid and Kraugel, not Grid and Overgeared, so his initial intention to maximize the existence of Overgeared was broken. He was upset.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is because of Kraugel.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wondered why the S.A. Group listened to their request, but it was because there was this motivation behind it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is bad.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The opening was a secondary problem.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel planned to impress the public with the Overgeared Guild by having the members win a medal in each event.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now he might miss it due to the variable called Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Considering Kraugel’s inclinations, he is likely to participate in PvP, raid, and the siege.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gold medals in the three most popular events in the National Competition were very valuable.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, as long as Kraugel existed, it was realistic for the Overgeared members to give up on the gold medal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'...No, not if it’s Grid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to Grid, the reason he could win against Kraugel was because Kraugel wasn’t in a perfect condition.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Lauel believed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The sky isn’t untouchable.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Snow, rain, thunder, and typhoons would pour down, but the sky wouldn’t fall.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel knew that Kraugel shouldn’t have been knocked down, even if he was in an imperfect condition.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid being able to break down the sky, it wasn’t a coincidence or a miracle...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is skills.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel clenched his fists and started to write a letter to someone.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was someone who always tried to change the worst crisis into an opportunity.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘Genius at fighting’ Hao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The millions of Chinese people were thrilled and enthusiastic when he expressed his intention to participate in the 2nd National Competition, since he didn’t participate in the first one.&nbsp;</span><span style>They expected to see China ranked first in the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Hao was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘...Kraugel.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>His only object of reverence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I didn’t think you would participate in this tournament.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hao’s expression was already tense and sweat was trickling down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Can I play an active role against Kraugel?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>No.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hao was sure of it.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would never be able to reach the faraway sky that was Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then a homing pigeon flew towards him.&nbsp;</span><span style>The sender was Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style>The chief of staff of Overgeared wrote the letter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You didn’t accept my friend request, so I can’t send you a whisper. Thus, I had to send a letter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>You are the first person to not accept the best of the 10 Rookies and the brains of Overgeared’s request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This provocative attitude stimulated the other soul in my heart...]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Omitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hao quickly skimmed down the nonsense and found the main point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Do you remember the promise that you made in the past? If my lord, Grid, breaks down the sky and becomes a new sky, you will spread your wings and fly into Grid’s arms.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hao distinctly remembered it.&nbsp;</span><span style>The seven guilds failed to invade Reidan because they were crushed by farmers, and Hao was forced to retreat.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hao received an offer to serve Grid in exchange for his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that time, Hao said that the only thing to hold a dragon was a sky, and of course, that sky was Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid would break Kraugel?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s impossible.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Hao crumpled up the letter.&nbsp;</span><span style>He acknowledged Grid’s skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had appropriate control and exceptional items.&nbsp;</span><span style>The current Grid was one of the top rankers.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he was nothing compared to Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Someone who can’t overcome me won’t be able to beat Kraugel.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more he thought about it, the more absurd it was.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hao’s chest burned hot when he thought about Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It would be good to make them understand their target.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Overgeared Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would let them know that the world was very narrow.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hao’s golden eyes became determined to prove it.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Grid and the Overgeared members escaped from the 9th vampire city with the help of Sage Sticks.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had a busy day with various media interviews and filming the opening video of the National Competition. Now they gathered in Reidan after a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ba! Baba!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord toddled forward and greeted them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was moved to tears by the appearance of his big son.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is he calling me papa? Didn't you hear?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was exciting for Grid, but the other Overgeared members didn’t show much reaction.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ba! Bababa!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord used the same title for all the Overgeared members, not just Grid!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok... Surely you haven’t forgotten your dad after not meeting for so long?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid turned blue with shock.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lord turned his gaze away from the one who couldn’t hide his sadness and smiled meaningfully.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kasim watched him in the darkness and shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A little baby is already teasing an adult...’</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid shared the joy of a reunion with Irene and left the bedroom.&nbsp;</span><span style>He observed the sleeping Lord with the Great Lord's Sword and was astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Lord Steim</span></p>
 <p><span style>Age: 0 years &nbsp;Gender: Male</span></p>
 <p><span style>Occupation: Young Nobleman</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: Grid’s Son</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The son of a legendary blacksmith. He has inherited most of his father’s abilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: Genius of the Continent</span></p>
 <p><span style>* A genius that represents one continent. He overwhelms national geniuses, and his level and abilities will rise 60% faster than normal. In addition, he can acquire skills in a wide range of fields.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there is a limit to the level and abilities that can be raised until he is 15 years old.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: One who Will Become a Legend</span></p>
 <p><span style>A person who will leave his name in history. There is an 80% chance of being immune to all status effects and illnesses. When attacked, if his health falls to 1 point, he will enter the immortal state for 2.5 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level: 3</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strength: 40 &nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 45</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agility: 54 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligence: 47</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dexterity: 90 &nbsp;Charm: 100</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dignity: 17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insight: 80</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skills: Beginner Blacksmith Skill (F), Beginner Weapons Mastery (C), Daluka’s Methods (A+) Discerning Eyes (S), Overwhelming Charm (S), Lantier’s Method (SS), Famous and Legendary Pedigree (SS). </span></p>
 <p><span style>His mother is the successor of a noble family in the Eternal Kingdom and his father is a legend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He has inherited all of his parent’s strengths, so his potential is outstanding. Teaching him will be inspiring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, his talent and environment are so good that he is likely to become arrogant. Education will determine his history.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There is a title change and two more skills?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to Irene, Lord had received constant discipline during the month when Grid was away.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t surprising that his level and stats rose slightly.&nbsp;</span><span style>But why did ‘Genius of Eternal’ change to ‘Genius of the Continent?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It meant an increase in potential. There must’ve been a reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What on earth happened?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Daluka's Methods and Lantier’s Methods.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was also nervous about the high ratings of the newly acquired skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, Lantier’s Methods was a huge SS grade, meaning it was a legendary skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Who is the discipline teacher...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>How was he teaching to make a monster like this?&nbsp;</span><span style>This was completely...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A profit.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid sent a whisper to Rabbit, telling him to raise the discipline teacher’s salary.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to this, the wages of the discipline teacher rose from the minimum wage by 1 silver.</span></p>
