 <p><span style>Chapter 132</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>It was true that the pope had a higher level than Malacus and a higher overall combat power due to his stats. The problem was that his class was a priest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>A priest was a class that specialized in support abilities, with their combat ability being the lowest among all classes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, the pope’s only attack spell was Goddess’ Breath(a regular user would’ve died in one blow from Goddess’ Breath).&nbsp;</span><span style>The only method the pope used to attack Grid was to release magic power (ordinary users wouldn’t have survived even a simple magic bombardment).</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, rankers chose the right class for their power and they had a lot of combat experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you call me stupid? Even my father never said such things to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asuka’s face reddened as she puffed up angrily.&nbsp;</span><span style>She rushed towards Grid and started to wield her double swords.&nbsp;</span><span style>The duration of Transcend and Blacksmith’s Rage ended, and Grid was in a state of crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was startled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What? Isn’t she much faster than earlier?’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t easy to keep up with the double swords coming continuously.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Grid fired Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Link.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Chaeeeeeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Asuka barely managed to block 3 of Grid’s 17 linked strikes. Then she used Sword Frenzy to block up 9 more strikes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>But there were still 5 remaining. She allowed those five attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the party information window, Asuka’s health dropped to less than half in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban panicked, but Black Teddy was always beside Asuka and he wasn’t worried.&nbsp;</span><span style>Black Teddy knew better than anyone that a berserker became stronger when their health fell.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwakakakang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asuka’s attack power increased by 40% and her attack speed by 20%.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid started to become injured as the battle continued.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 1,900 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 2,080 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No, why is she so much stronger?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid hurriedly recalled the pavranium from where they were attacking Box. Then he regained some breathing room.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Chaeeeeeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t it easy for the pavranium to rotate around Grid and defend against all of Asuka’s strikes?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is that item? Legendary rated?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid ignored Asuka’s question and pulled out the Ideal Dagger. He used Quick Movements before swiftly changing back to Dainsleif.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shut up and die quickly!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s high insight confirmed that Asuka’s combat power was rising.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was frustrated.&nbsp;</span><span style>He resorted to only relying on pavranium to defend as the rushed at Asuka.&nbsp;</span><span style>He struck down on Asuka’s shoulder and succeeded in slashing it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid linked his attacks while Asuka paused.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Papat!</span></i> <i><span style>Papapat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Asuka survived the stabbing attacks and her health was reduced to only 20%.&nbsp;</span><span style>From this point on, she showed the genuine strength of a berserker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered serious damage. Maximizing the berserk effect.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Attack power will increase by 80% and attack speed will increase by 50%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the 50% increase in attack speed, the use of large weapons was now maximized.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asuka swapped to a halberd that was bigger than her body and wielded it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid tried to defend against the halberd attack, but he couldn’t endure the overwhelming attack power.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban felt some hope at the scene and used a buff on Asuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Fierce Momentum!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Fierce Momentum is activated. You and your party’s attack power will increase by 30%, while defense is reduced by 20%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Box didn’t stay still either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Magic Power Resonance!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The effect of Magic Power Resonance is activated. The buff effect applied to you and your party members will increase by 1.5 times.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ohhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asuka felt the overwhelming power and shouted. She swung the halberd again, leaving a red afterimage.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Crazy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Asuka’s attack was blocked by Dainsleif, Grid’s body disappeared into the air.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the moment when the immune Grid was forcibly caught in the air by a physical force he couldn’t resist.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was another one of Asuka’s unique weapons, ‘Hell Chains.’ Then she unfolded Chain Frenzy and Grid was stuck in the air for two seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white bear warrior rushed forward through this gap. Then it swung its paws at Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the golden discs spun and defended against the bear’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asuka smiled with satisfaction.&nbsp;</span><span style>She had been waiting for the gold discs protecting Grid’s body to be preoccupied elsewhere.&nbsp;</span><span style>0.5 seconds before Grid’s captivity ended.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asuka revealed the ‘Onslaught Greatsword,’ her weapon with the strongest attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She jumped and stabbed the greatsword into Grid’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid screamed as red filled his vision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have been hit by a blow!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 29,900 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Given the fact that the Holy Light Armor reduced physical damage by 40%, Asuka’s attack power was currently far above common sense.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Grid hadn’t been wearing the Holy Light Armor, he would’ve lost his life.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Flop!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s captive state ended and he rolled onto the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>Box watched the blood pouring from him and was convinced that they could defeat Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Suddenly, a green light appeared on Grid’s finger as the effect of Doran’s ring was activated and 50% of the damage incurred to Grid was restored to his health. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Once this was triggered, there was a 10-minute cooldown, and it had been exactly 10 minutes since Grid first received a blow from Box’s party.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, he hadn’t equipped the Holy Light Armor 10 minutes ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Holy Light Armour had an option for a 300% increase in recovery magic!&nbsp;</span><span style>With 29,900 damage, Doran’s Ring would restore 14,950 health. This was then tripled, making it equivalent to Grid regaining all of his health.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[44,850 health has been restored.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit. I almost died.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid cursed as he raised his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asuka’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style>There wasn’t a single wound on Grid’s body, no mark where Grid’s heart should be injured? There wasn’t even a single scratch!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban, Black Teddy, and Box were stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cooldown of Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Kill, ended.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asuka perceived the killing intent and swapped back to using double swords for defense.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, it would be hard alone, prompting Black Teddy to command the white bear warrior to defend her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the white bear’s health was depleted from the previous bombardment and tt failed to defend against Grid’s Kill, instantly destroyed by the blow.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Kill passed through the white bear’s flesh and collided with Asuka’s double swords.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Kyaaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time Asuka experienced it: it was her first defeat to another Satisfy user, her first user-driven death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your party member Asuka has died.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"W-What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person they relied on the most had died.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban was half amazed and half frustrated. Box shivered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is enough...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Box’s reason for being obsessed with Grid was different from Asuka. He wasn’t looking for Grid’s class like Asuka. He was checking to make sure that Grid was worthy of an invitation.&nbsp;</span><span style>In fact, Box’s true identity was a spy for another guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid! Leave the Tzedakah Guild and come to our guild. In the unified guild rankings, we are...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Box revealed he was part of another guild and tried to invite Grid! He couldn’t even finish speaking.&nbsp;</span><span style>A black energy shield hit his neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have been hit by a lethal blow!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have died.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Crazy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t called a psychopath for no reason.&nbsp;</span><span style>How could he cut a person’s neck when they were talking?&nbsp;</span><span style>Box was dumbfounded. He died with a grimace and changed into grey light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only ones left were Black Teddy and Toban.&nbsp;</span><span style>Black Teddy was furious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You dare... How dare you kill the Young Lady!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid glared at him,&nbsp;</span><span style>“I’m wrong for killing her? Think about it. Who attacked me first and who tried to kill me first? Who should be angry right now? Ah, shit. I’m becoming angrier the more I think about it. Die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Teddy was strong, but he wasn’t that strong. His pets were already dead and couldn’t be summoned again right away.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid attacked and he also turned into light.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Toban was the only one left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha...”&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban couldn’t say anything and laughed awkwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smiled sharply at him,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Aren’t you good at acting? You should receive something at this year’s acting awards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban continued laughing and Grid’s gaze became more menacing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have any excuses?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban also had a conscience. He no longer wanted to deceive Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He bowed in front of Grid and shouted,&nbsp;</span><span style>“I’m sorry! I was blinded by greed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid squatted in front of him. Then he extended a hand.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban didn’t understand what it meant.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid spoke to the confused Toban,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Give me money. If you give me enough money to soften my anger, I might forget about this. You don’t have to if you don’t want to. I will just report you to Jishuka.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka’s nature meant she couldn’t stand traitors.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban knew this better than anyone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban’s inventory was robbed. He currently had 20,000 gold.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was worth 24 million won.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Toban was truly sorry towards Grid and was afraid of retaliation, so he didn’t hesitate to pay a large amount to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, some of Grid’s anger was released.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t bad that he earned 24 million won from one battle.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid put the money in the inventory and told Toban.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay. This is enough for now. But I’m sorry. Don’t even dream of having an item made by me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“G-Grid...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban felt like crying. However, he felt so sorry that he couldn’t ask Grid to forgive him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s heart softened as he saw the genuine regret and he gave Toban a ray of hope.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well... Yes. I will just forgive you. If you serve me like a slave, I will make you an item someday...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Serve as his slave?&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban wasn’t able to decide if he should appreciate this situation or not. But he had to accept since he was the one who did something wrong in the first place.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Grid ordered,</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stand up. Let's depart."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? Depart...? Where?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smiled sweetly at the confused Toban,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Let’s go complete my quest. You have become my slave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 1st ranked paladin and the 68th user on the unified rankings. It was the moment when Toban, first ranked paladin of the Judar Church and chief of staff of the Tzedakah Guild, became Grid’s slave.</span></p>
