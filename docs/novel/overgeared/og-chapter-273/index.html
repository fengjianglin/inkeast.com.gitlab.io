 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>OGC Station’s PD, Park Jongsoo.&nbsp;</span><span style>He entered Satisfy directly and watched Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s the pope candidate?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, the audience ratings will become 15% due to him. Stick seven cameras to him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s the rumored Isabel who is a Rebecca’s Daughter? She’s prettier than the rumors say.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right. Put two cameras on her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her beauty will increase the number of male viewers. It was an indispensable element in broadcasting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand. Eh? That person...?"&nbsp;</span><span style>Park PD was looking at Damian and Isabel, when he became excited at the sight of an Asian man.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Huroi! The person next to Damian is Huroi!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huroi? The first ranked orator, Huroi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes! Overgeared!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The person closest to Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s certain!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoh? What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone close to Grid was attached to a pope candidate?&nbsp;</span><span style>The eyes of the director shone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is Grid related to this election?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the first to obtain a legendary class and South Korea’s pride.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was involved in a variety of events, and now he was intervening in the Rebecca Church?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe this... Perhaps we might obtain a scoop?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, regardless of Grid, Huroi could be doing a personal activity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But we need to keep an eye out. We need to find out what type of relationship pope candidate Damian and Grid have. Put two cameras on Huroi as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, I understand. Then what about that man?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man wore a bizarre half mask that had a curious symmetry between crying and smiling.&nbsp;</span><span style>His face and ID couldn’t be seen.&nbsp;</span><span style>He seemed to be close with Damian’s group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Put one camera on him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The courtyard that Huroi was in. Park PD agreed with the director’s command to observe the man more thoroughly.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s current insight stat exceeded 1,400. He could feel the attention of two low level users from 50m away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They are the station officials.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as they logged out, the cameras would start to roll.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was able to grasp their exact distance, despite not seeing them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s too annoying, which is why I hid my identity.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid scoffed.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t find the cameras particularly intrusive. It would be easy to escape them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian asked him,&nbsp;</span><span style>“You have sealed Lifael’s Spear, so are you returning to Reidan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Damian and Isabel looked regretful.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. I still have something to do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal finally recognized Grid as an enemy. It was what he wanted.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment that Pascal attacked him...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will get experience.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian spoke to Grid who was smiling wickedly.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Then please watch over me. I will do my best. I will tell everyone why I must become pope. I believe it is the reward for your infinite grace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian had been making speeches with Huroi, so his eyes were filled with confidence.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid nodded as he saw the imposing gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll trust you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you. Then go and get ready.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid, you must tell me before you leave. Don’t leave without telling me. Understood?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian and Isabel left for the venue, leaving Grid and Huroi alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>Isabel looked back a few times, like she was worried that Grid might disappear, but Damian just looked ahead and vowed again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to work hard today to build a foundation that will allow me to become pope.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid saved Isabel-chan. Huroi also helped Damian gain the trust of the church’s members.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian was desperate to give back to those who hadn’t been able to hunt for two weeks because they were stuck in the Vatican.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I need to gain the ability to repay them. And in order to defend Isabel, I must become pope.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian looked like he was heading to the battlefield.&nbsp;</span><span style>After a moment.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi asked carefully after he was left alone with Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can I ask what it is you still have to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hunting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hunting... What are you saying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, apart from Ruby and Sexy Schoolgirl, aren’t you and I the only ones who haven’t reached level 300? Since we came all the way here, shouldn’t we get some levels?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Vatican was an area with no monsters. It meant there was nothing to hunt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you going to catch to level up...? Can I ask about your plan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had some idea. But he wanted his prediction to be wrong, so he asked out loud.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid laughed at Huroi.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Elders.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal and the elders.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were trash who despised the weak and were a huge barrier to Damian.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>What would they do if Damian gave a good speech?&nbsp;</span><span style>He could never become pope with Pascal in the way. Grid had to take care of Pascal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s gaze shifted behind Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There is a bonus of seven knights.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi hurriedly looked back.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were two knights in red armor and five knights in black armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grid, I will pay back that disgrace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid welcomed Kamiyan,&nbsp;</span><span style>“You came.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was relaxed. According to his own experience, the Black Knights and Red Knights were weak, unlike the rumors. The rumors must be exaggerated.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid judged that he could take care of two Red Knights and the Black Knights in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The pope candidate’s speech event will begin soon. For the sake of safety, all outsiders are prohibited from possessing weapons.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[All weapons in your inventory will be disabled.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bewildered Grid and Huroi cried out.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kamiyan laughed at them and pulled out his sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kamiyan received the warning from Pascal ahead of time and registered the knights with the Rebecca Church.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an effective temporary measure. Unlike Grid and Huroi, they could use weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This will be your grave."</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Ah, really.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been a really long time since he stepped in shit.&nbsp;</span><span style>As Kamiyan approached, Grid retreated behind Huroi and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We should leave here for now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good decision!”&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi immediately summoned his drake.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Descend! Lord of the Skies above the Grasslands!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was only silence.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s expression stiffened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why isn’t your drake coming?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T-That...”&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi started sweating.&nbsp;</span><span style>"My pet summoning doesn’t work.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That joke isn’t funny in a situation like this."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid tried to summon Noe and Randy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Goddess Rebecca is watching the pope candidates. Due to the extreme divine power concentrated on the Vatican, non-human existences can’t enter.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Pet summoning has failed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There really is a variety of things.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The relaxation disappeared from Grid’s face as he grumbled.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“The problem with the Rebecca Church is that it is divided into several factions. Unity must be achieved in order to properly go against the Yatan Church...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The speeches from the pope candidates began. They were free to speak as they liked. It caused drowsiness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>OGC Station.&nbsp;</span><span style>The employees had dark expressions.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because the rating for the live broadcast didn’t meet their expectations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you spread the information that a user is appearing among the pope candidates?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The candidate’s speeches are more boring than expected. There isn’t enough to make the viewers stick around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Try to focus on Damian more than the speeches of the other pope candidates. Keep filming the people I mentioned.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Out of the dozens of monitors, the most notable one was Isabel’s beautiful face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The director was biting his fingernails out of nervousness, when his eyes suddenly widened.&nbsp;</span><span style>Something was happening on a small monitor at the bottom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Number 19! Look at monitor number 19!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>This is boring.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Why am I watching this broadcast?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Isabel is really pretty.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The netizens, who came to the OGC web channel after hearing that there was a user among the pope candidates, started complaining.&nbsp;</span><span style>The chat window was bombarded with curses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>No fun.</span></i> <i><span style>No fun.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Guys, is the pope going to be decided today?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Nope.</span></i> <i><span style>The pope election is in one month.</span></i> <i><span style>This is just publicity for the pope candidates.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-What? Then I don’t need to watch this.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I know who the pope candidate is, so I will be going.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>The PvP tournament is live on another channel right now.</span></i> <i><span style>There is more benefit to watching that.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I should go see.</span></i> <i><span style>There’s no point watching this broadcast.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thus.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a quick reduction in the number of viewers on the OGC web channel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Suddenly, knights in red armor and black armor filled the screen that previously contained Isabel’s face and the boring pope candidates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Huh?</span></i> <i><span style>Red Knights?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-Wow!</span></i> <i><span style>Red Knights and Black Knights?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>This isn’t fake?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>It’s real if you look at the pattern on the armor.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-The Saharan Empire’s strongest knights!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Their unannounced appearance excited the viewers.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>-But why are the Red Knights and Blacks Knights in the Vatican?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Who are they fighting?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The attention of the audience focused on the people that the enemy knights were attacking.&nbsp;</span><span style>The opponents were two users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>One was an unidentified masked man and the other was the first ranked orator, Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Why are users fighting knights...?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Huroi will die.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Even if he is part of the Overgeared Guild, he still can’t beat a knight</span></i><span style> ~ </span><i><span style>ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>It will be the first time the Overgeared Guild is defeated.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Who is the masked man?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-Who cares? It won’t last long.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was a one-sided battle.&nbsp;</span><span style>The knight called Kamiyan was driving back the man in the mask, while five Black Knights were surrounding Huroi.&nbsp;</span><span style>They wielded swords, while the masked man and Huroi could only evade and defend without any weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why weren’t they holding weapons?&nbsp;</span><span style>As the viewers started to question it, subtitles rose that explained the current situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Non-Rebecca Church members are prohibited from using weapons.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who was the man in the mask? Why and how were they under attack by the Red Knights and Black Knights?&nbsp;</span><span style>The viewers wondered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>But they quickly realized that their questions wouldn’t be resolved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>It’s over.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Boring.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This fight will soon be over.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The man in the mask and Huroi would soon be pierced by the swords and turned to ashes, then the screen would once again show the boring speeches of the pope candidates.&nbsp;</span><span style>The viewers were sure of it, but the man in the video didn’t allow the obvious development.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You disgraceful bastards are really cheap.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man in the mask cursed...</span></p>
 <p><span style>This voice was familiar?</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Eh???</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-Grid?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>God Grid!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The comments in the chat window and the ratings started to rise exponentially.&nbsp;</span><span style>OGC’s director was startled.&nbsp;</span><span style>As everyone’s attention was focused on the screen...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lifael’s Spear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid pulled out a gold spear.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the pavranium that used to be divided into seven blades in the past.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now it exerted an overwhelming attack power, causing blood to spray from Kamiyan’s chest.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earlier, the director said that Damian would cause the ratings to rise to 15%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are unable to measure the audience ratings!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The call to raise the advertising shook OGC Station.</span></p>
