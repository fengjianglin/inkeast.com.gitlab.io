 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Experts also observed that Bondre was likely to win.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 An ice mystic is a class that specializes in restraints and defense. All attacking skills cause slowness and frost, and certain skills freeze the target entirely. This means it’s possible to completely link CCs. 』&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 It isn’t just that. An ice mystic also has tremendous defensive abilities. They can use a wide variety of shielding spells, especially against physical attacks. Perfect CC and superior defense ability. It acts as a perfect counter to a physical dealer class. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Obviously, there are disadvantages to the class. Their firepower is weak and it isn’t popular in hunting and raids. However, a player’s health is exceptionally low compared to a monster. A weak firepower doesn’t matter in PvP. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Hrmm... As our friend mentioned, CC is an advantage of an ice mystic. Didn’t Grid show perfect immunity to Bubat’s CC during the target processing? Isn’t Grid immune to all kinds of CC? Then won’t Bondre’s CC skills be sealed? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 That isn’t the case. Even if Grid is immune to CCs, he can’t free himself from the ice. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Why? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 If Bondre uses something like ‘Ice Prison’ or ‘Ice Spider Web’ to physically block his path, CC resistance is meaningless. Grid will become trapped in a narrow cage and the target of the famous ‘Absolute Zero.’ 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Are you saying he will disable Grid by limiting the space? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 That’s right. In particular, it should be noted that the stage of the PvP is an island. In an area with a lot of water, an ice magician’s magic power and casting speed will increase by 20%. Isn’t Bondre strongest in water? It’s hard to imagine he will be defeated. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Victory or defeat doesn’t matter. We should just rejoice over getting to appreciate the beautiful and famous Ice Spider Web. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ice Spider Web was a very effective, but colorful magic.&nbsp;</span><span style>The magic that shaped the webs froze all moisture in the atmosphere and completely restrained all objects in its range.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The target would become trapped in the spider web that came from all four directions and become pure prey. They couldn’t lift a finger because there was no space to move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three months ago, Bondre was able to win a PvP competition hosted by JIN, a leading Japanese company, because of the Ice Spider Webs.&nbsp;</span><span style>He completely overwhelmed Katz, JIN’s successor and the third epic class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right, class isn’t important. Bondre is a normal class, but he trampled on an epic class? He doesn’t have to be afraid, even if his opponent has a legendary class.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Bondre is a smart and solid player. Unlike Hurent, I believe that he can beat Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of the French agreed with the opinion of the experts. They didn’t doubt Bondre’s victory.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a basis for their faith.&nbsp;</span><span style>In fact, Bondre had never been defeated in battle.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wasn’t called ‘100 Matches 100 Victories’ Bondre for no reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the reaction of the people apart from the French were divided.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I no longer believe the words of the experts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. Didn’t they say that Hurent would unconditionally win against Grid, and the result was the exact opposite?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But it’s true that Bondre is strong. He is famous as an undefeated legend...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Certainly, Bondre’s level isn’t as high as Hurent’s level. Can’t Grid beat Bondre? I’m looking forward to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Korean netizens also started to discuss it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>100 Matches 100 Victories Bondre...</span></i> <i><span style>Indeed, this time it will be tough for Grid.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>God Grid will win.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Bondre is a famous ranker known for his clever plays.</span></i> <i><span style>Have you forgotten how he fooled all the other rankers to win the labyrinth breakthrough?</span></i> <i><span style>Grid already showed Restraint in the battle against Hurent, so he will be thoroughly attacked by Bondre.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Won’t God Grid unconditionally win if he manages to approach?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>An ice mystic is about stiffness.</span></i> <i><span style>If he installs several layers of ice barriers and shields, Grid won’t be able to use a skill.</span></i> <i><span style>Then Hurent will counterattack when Grid can’t use skills.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>How will he approach in the first place?</span></i> <i><span style>To be honest, an ice mystic is a scam.</span></i> <i><span style>Although the speed of hunting is slow, so it’s difficult to level up.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>But Bondre is ranked 11th.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>That means Bondre is really skilled.</span></i> <i><span style>On the other hand, Grid has all his items.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>People are acting the same again.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Didn’t you say that Grid couldn’t beat Hurent?</span></i> <i><span style>But the result?</span></i> <i><span style>Grid won in 5 seconds.</span></i> <i><span style>Don’t pretend that you know everything.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Shut up and praise God Grid.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“He seems to be facing a strong opponent this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo’s parents couldn’t hide their anxious expressions.&nbsp;</span><span style>The experts on the TV were predicting their son’s defeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee reassured her parents.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Oppa will win again."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even before the confrontation with Hurent, people around the world said that her brother wouldn’t win.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the result?&nbsp;</span><span style>Her brother won in only 5 seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee believed that her brother would win again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘All the time and passion that brother has poured into Satisfy...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee didn’t know anything about Satisfy. But it was hard to think that her brother, who spent all his time in Satisfy, would be defeated by others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Isn’t that right? Oppa. Just win.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her brother had been ignored by others, and now he was being acknowledged by many people all over the world. Sehee’s heart was happy. She was proud of her brother.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The Korean team’s waiting room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura was nervous.&nbsp;</span><span style>After Youngwoo defeated Hurent, he didn’t return to the waiting room, but went somewhere else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I need to give Youngwoo-ssi advice...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bondre was a completely different style of opponent from Hurent.&nbsp;</span><span style>She had been directly defeated by him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo had logged out Hurent in just five seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was a phenomenal record, but she was worried he would become careless after it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If he’s trapped in an ice prison or web, there will be no room to swing his sword.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo’s greatswords were at least 3m in length.&nbsp;</span><span style>Greatswords weren’t a weapon capable of being swung in a tight space.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the end once he was trapped. The sword wouldn’t be able to swing, he wouldn’t be able to break the wall of ice and he would eventually become the victim of Absolute Zero.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He needs to end the match before Bondre uses his ice prisons and webs.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura wanted to pass this on to Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Youngwoo didn’t pick up his phone and she couldn’t give him advice because he was missing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If he’s careless...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As moment Yura was worrying...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo was meeting a person in a secret place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"My name is Rail Smith. My ID in Satisfy is Lauel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person who introduced himself was too young to be called a man, but too mature to be called a boy.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was estimated to be in his late teens.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had blond hair and white skin. His eyes were calm and he had stubborn lips. He had a pretty forehead and narrow jaw.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He was so beautiful that he reminded Grid of the main character of a British teen movie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo felt strong hostility towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"So what? Why did you call me here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was confused by the expression on Youngwoo’s face and explained.&nbsp;</span><span style>“The Tzedakah Guild... No, not exactly. Please accept me as your subordinate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid knew who Lauel was.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because Ibellin often talked about Lauel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A genius among geniuses.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only person who Ibellin considered as a rival.&nbsp;</span><span style>That guy wanted to be Youngwoo’s subordinate?&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo made a funny face and asked bluntly,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Why do you want to follow me? Is it because you want me to make you an item?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel also answered honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo nodded. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"Okay."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was baffled because Youngwoo agreed so easily. In fact, he thought Youngwoo would be reluctant. Everything he prepared to convince Youngwoo became obsolete.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The more slaves I have, the better.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel didn’t speak Korean perfectly. Therefore, he didn’t know the exact meaning of the word ‘slave,’ but he was sure it meant ‘subordinate’ based on the context.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Thank you for accepting me. As long as you can give me what I want, I will pledge my loyalty to you forever.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel spoke such words so casually. This guy, there was another person like Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Not bad.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Recently his minerals finder - Minor, had only been recommending dangerous places to him.&nbsp;</span><span style>For example, Cork Island Dungeon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I never thought I would have to fight the great demon Hell Gao when I was just trying to mine a mineral. I need a bodyguard in case that absurd situation occurs again.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He already had a powerful knight called Jude, but Jude was an NPC. Unlike users, NPCs had a finite life. He was reluctant to take them to dangerous places with him because he was worried about them dying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Lauel was a user.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo was making a happy expression when Lauel gave advice to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should be careful of Bondre. Don’t give him time to case his ice prisons and webs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don't know what ice prisons and webs are, but don’t they require casting time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Yes, but it will be difficult to approach him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bondre could generate an ice barrier around 1m in diameter in less than 1.5 seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even if Grid advanced while resisting all types of status conditions like slow, frostbite and freeze, he would inevitably be delayed by the barrier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"By the time you break the ice barrier, Bondre will finish casting his magic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>So what?&nbsp;</span><span style>Ranged skills were the answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If I had to give advice on how to fight...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo waved his hand at Lauel, who was trying to explain the timing to use the Transcended Link skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will take care of it."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be good to taste frustration at least once.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel hoped that after Youngwoo was defeated by Bondre, he would abandon arrogance to become more prudent.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t know.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo had already suffered numerous setbacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Anyway, I can log out Bondre in 5 seconds.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, Youngwoo wasn’t being arrogant. He knew his strength better than anyone else, so he calmly grasped the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I'm the strongest.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent had referred to boss monsters as fools who just used strength. Boss monsters were strong, but they could be ignored.&nbsp;</span><span style>But what was the reality?&nbsp;</span><span style>The pope, the Awakened Guardian of the Forest, and Hell Gao.&nbsp;</span><span style>Had Hurent ever struggled with big shots like them? Even if he had fought strong boss monsters, had he ever defeated them alone?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He doesn’t understand the subject.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo ignored such a man.&nbsp;</span><span style>Didn’t he smash that conceited guy in 5 seconds? It was funnier the more he thought about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Puhuhu.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 After a while, the first match of the round of 16 will begin. All participants should go to the capsule room. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo moved according to the guide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I am on a different dimension from all of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only legend.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would show the world why a legend was a legend.&nbsp;</span><span style>And.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Grid, who logged out Aura Master Hurent in 5 seconds and the undefeated Bondre! With hundreds of thousands of spectators and hundreds of millions of viewers watching! Their showdown! Start! 』 </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Papat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid and Bondre appeared in the desolate garden of the Lion’s Castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ice Field.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bondre didn’t delay.&nbsp;</span><span style>He immediately changed the surroundings to make it more advantageous to him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeok!</span></i> <i><span style>Jjejejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The ground in a 50m radius was completely frozen. Now Grid would slip if he moved even one step.&nbsp;</span><span style>And.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid stood in place, not even trying to take one step.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bondre laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I’ve blocked his skills.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid needed at least four steps every time he used Pagma’s Swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now he couldn’t move as he liked on the ice field.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>And even if he didn’t slip?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A sharp piece of ice will protrude with every step he makes, meaning it is impossible to do his sword dance.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had only one choice.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t use skills on the ground. So he would inevitably fly up in the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bondre was planning to completely trap Grid using the Ice Spider Web.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will finish it with Absolute Zero.'</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ssik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As Bondre was smiling with satisfaction.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid still didn’t take a single step as he swung his black greatsword lightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Golden Flash.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwaaaaaang!</span></i></p>

 <p><span style>Weight: 45,019/110,520</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s intelligence reached 853 when he wore Malacus’ Cloak.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had the level 200 stats awakening. In other words, the second awakening meant mana would increase by 6 and magic damage by 2 with every point in intelligence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid currently had 1,706 magic power.&nbsp;</span><span style>What if this was multiplied by many times?&nbsp;</span><span style>The attack power would far exceed that of Bondre’s Absolute Zero.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Didn’t Grid always dance when he used a skill?&nbsp;</span><span style>Then what was this skill?&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t expect it at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ice Barrier!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bondre paled as he hurriedly used magic.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ice Barrier was the shield with the most ‘physical defense’ among all the shields Bondre could use.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was helpless in front of Golden Flash that dealt damage proportional to magic power.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Heok...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Golden Flash completely penetrated through the shield.&nbsp;</span><span style>With its overwhelming aura, the ice barrier collapsed instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 12,530 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A blow that took 40% of a user’s health at once would stun the user for three seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style>Just now, Bondre lost 80% of his health.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You can’t regain your mental state.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-What...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt a chill go down his spine.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dozens of energy blades were coming towards his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A devastating explosion shook the Lion’s Castle.&nbsp;</span><span style>The commentator witnessed a faint grey light and shouted reflexively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 P-Player Bondre has been logged out...! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time it was 4 seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘4 seconds’ was ranked first on the real time search terms of various portal sites.&nbsp;</span><span style>The world was once again in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zibal jumped to his feet in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He broke the ice barrier? That means his magic power...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zibal hadn’t lost his composure when Hurent lost.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent was overconfident and was stung by Grid. It didn’t mean anything more.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now that idea had changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A monster.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was Grid hiding a special trick?&nbsp;</span><span style>Nonsense.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He wasn’t hiding anything. His power just significantly exceeded Zibal’s predictions.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was immeasurable.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yes, just like Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was someone that couldn’t be matched until the third advancement class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the world started pouring praise towards Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Korean netizens united for the first time in almost 100 years and shouted ‘God Grid!’&nbsp;</span><span style>The experts also didn’t ignore Grid anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 The phrase ‘Praise God Grid’ is spreading on the Internet. I also want to praise God Grid. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 That... Me too... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 ... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At a hunting ground, Peak Sword witnessed a party composed of foreigners and asked them in broken English.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know Grid?”</span></p>
