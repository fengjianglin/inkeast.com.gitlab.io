 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Damian was just walking along. He couldn’t think of anything in his behavior that would’ve caused wariness.&nbsp;</span><span style>So why were these people blocking the road? The attitude of the farmers didn’t make sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian thought about it before making a reasonable guess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They don’t like me because I’m an otaku.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian’s equipment were engraved with all types of phrases.&nbsp;</span><span style>The phrases written in gold looked very nice, because they had a sense of harmony with the white color of the gear.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, this changed after seeing the contents of the phrases.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I love you Rin-chan, beautiful Isabel-chan, cute Luna-chan, Rebecca’s Daughters forever, and so on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The contents of the phrases were things that invited disdain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Some people were so disgusted that they caused a fight because they didn’t want to see it.&nbsp;</span><span style>In reality and in games, an otaku was a target of hatred and derision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Damian didn’t give in.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to freely express his love for Rebecca’s Daughters.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t understand why he should be criticized for the act of loving someone so purely and enthusiastically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m a paladin of the Rebecca Church. Why are you asking me who I am?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian's attitude was cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the farmers smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style>“You don’t seem to be an ordinary paladin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian exclaimed.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Yes! I am not an ordinary paladin, I’m an otaku paladin! So what? Do you want to beat me up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Otaku? What is that? Anyway, won’t you fight me? The divine power that I can feel around you is very interesting compared to all the paladins and priests I’ve met so far.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian finally figured out the situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>These farmers weren’t mad at him for being an otaku. They were just crazy.&nbsp;</span><span style>A farmer who detected his powerful divine power and wanted to challenge him?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was safe to say that he had crossed a line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He’s crazy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian felt compassion for the farmer. Then he sincerely prayed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Goddess of light, please bless these poor people...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a moment.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian finished praying and said goodbye to the farmers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I hope that you will restore your spirit under Goddess Rebecca’s divine favor. Then I’m going now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian didn’t look back. He didn’t want to encounter these crazy farmers for long, so he hurried towards the gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I need to meet Grid as soon as possible.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He needed to ask Grid to seal Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style>He just wondered if the greedy Grid would do it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will save Isabel-chan, even if I have to give him all my possessions.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would devote his soul for her.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was when he was making a pledge again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There was a loud sound. Damian turned his head to see a hoe flying towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was clearly killing intent.&nbsp;</span><span style>An overwhelming qi.&nbsp;</span><span style>It would cause great damage if he didn’t block it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian instinctively sensed and hurriedly raised his shield.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A strong shockwave occurred as a result of the hoe and white shield colliding. The whole wheat field shook.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian was appalled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Strong!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was incredible attack power.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was enough to make his spine chill, the first paladin of the Rebecca Church.&nbsp;</span><span style>As he was feeling confused, the farmer pulled back his hoe and threw off his straw hat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An NPC called Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>He looked amused as he held a hoe in one hand and a hand plow in the other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Good defense. I’ll have to use Supreme Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro was excited.&nbsp;</span><span style>First there was Duke Grid, the Overgeared members, Kraugel, and now Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was excited by the fact that he met powerful people who couldn’t be overpowered with the Imperial Swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to deal with him seriously, like when I am fighting Kraugel.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he competed with Duke Grid at Loran Falls.&nbsp;</span><span style>At that time, Piaro hadn’t been in the proper mental state. He wasn’t able to demonstrate his skills properly.&nbsp;</span><span style>But after being with Duke Grid for the past few months, Piaro had become emotionally stable. Now he could exert his full skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s start.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian quickly rejected. There was no reason to fight.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Piaro was stubborn.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You must take me down in order to enter Reidan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What’s this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian thought it was ridiculous.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a city where a farmer was the gatekeeper.&nbsp;</span><span style>The other farmer standing silently suddenly whispered to Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please do it moderately. I also want to fight with him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had been working in the fields and training with Piaro for a fortnight.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to Piaro, he had certainly become stronger than before.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now he only lost half his health when confronting Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even that monster was looking forward to a fight with Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An exceptional person who rose to become the number two paladin, despite being a paladin of the Rebeccan Church.&nbsp;</span><span style>But one day, he suddenly disappeared from the rankings list, so there were rumors that he obtained a hidden class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That person was Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian was famous, so Kraugel was interested in news about him.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Damian himself was unaware that he was a celebrity. He was only interested in Rebecca’s Daughters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyway, that celebrity was currently in a desperate crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The continent's strongest swordsman, Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The peak of two billion users, Kraugel.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was destined to fight those two in turn.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Flower Guild was one of the axis of the seven guilds.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had 30 members.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were few in number, but all 30 members were elites in the top 100 of the magician rankings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In particular, their guild master Bondre was an overwhelming talent.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the first ranking magician and 11th on the unified rankings just a month ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to the Overgeared members, his ranking was pushed to 17th. However, there was nobody who would disagree that he was strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ah, there was Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the National Competition, Grid had logged out Bondre in four seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But that was then and this was now.&nbsp;</span><span style>After his disgrace in the National Competition, Bondre struggled to acquire more S-grade magic.&nbsp;</span><span style>He poured all his money, time, and effort into it.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a result, Bondre was now much more powerful than he was in the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had three S-grade magic spells.&nbsp;</span><span style>Nine months later, the Second National Competition would be held in France, his home country. At that place, he planned to thoroughly get revenge on Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will log you out in three seconds.”&nbsp;</span><span style>But before that.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Today, I will shatter your estate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That damn Grid was the lord of Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bondre would make it a vacant lot.&nbsp;</span><span style>The development of the city that occurred in the last few months would be in vain! Cruelly! Perfectly!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will make you crumble! Kuhahahaha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The disease has returned.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guild members talked among themselves as they watched their guild master having an outburst.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their guild master was often like this after being defeated by Grid in the National Competition. They missed his past appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? What is that?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a strange forest filled with thorny vines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>This was currently the west of the Eternal Kingdom. The desert would soon appear in front of everyone.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Ice Flower Guild suddenly stopped marching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was because there were hundreds of people in the distance.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were blocking the forest’s narrow path.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t they seem like refugees?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Their timing is dirty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guild was close to Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the 900 refugees made their march slow down, so the Ice Flower Guild became irritated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just kill them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bondre witnessed it and spat out terrible words.&nbsp;</span><span style>The guild members winced and calmed Bondre down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Our infamy will shoot through the roof if we kill so many people. It will be impossible to play the game normally for a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Master. Please take it easy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit! Shit! Shit! I want to smash Reidan right now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look! We can fly in the sky!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bondre was losing his mind because his enemy’s empty house was right in front of him.&nbsp;</span><span style>The guild members tried to calm him down.&nbsp;</span><span style>They could fly in the sky using magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s fly through the sky until we escape the forest. How about it? Okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bondre barely recovered control and nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sigh... Okay. It’s unfortunate that mana will be consumed, but it’s still less than killing those people.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Float.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Bondre was using Fly along with his guild members.&nbsp;</span><span style>A hand sprang out from a thorny vine and grabbed a guild member.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Flower Guild couldn’t grasp the situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were stunned as they received a notification window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your party member Ren has died.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is crazy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was going on?&nbsp;</span><span style>Bondre aimed magic in the direction that the mysterious hand protruded from.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwajajajajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The ice bombs rapidly cooled the vines and destroyed them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Ren’s dead body came into view.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Where?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had to find the person who killed Ren.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bondre and the guild members searched the area, but they couldn’t find the enemy.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kyak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your party member Silver has died.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bondre and the guild members paled.&nbsp;</span><span style>A companion standing near them had died and they still couldn’t detect the enemy. It was like there was a ghost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Assassin.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A strong assassin that the level 303 Bondre couldn’t detect, that was powerful enough to kill magicians whose levels were in the late 200s.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yes, like Faker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Faker?’&nbsp;</span><span style>A chill went down Bondre’s spine.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘It can’t be.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was it really Faker?&nbsp;</span><span style>If so!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bondre hurriedly exclaimed.&nbsp;</span><span style>“We shouldn’t be here! Get out of the forest now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An assassin was the counter of a magician.&nbsp;</span><span style>Magicians had low health, defense and agility, so they couldn’t afford to go against the swift assassins.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was worse in a dark place like this with many obstacles. They had to move to a wide area.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Ice Flower Guild made this judgment and instantly used Haste. It was to escape the forest after increasing their movement speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the person in the darkness had no intention of letting them go.&nbsp;</span><span style>He threw daggers aimed at the magicians.</span></p>
