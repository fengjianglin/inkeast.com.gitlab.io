 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Bairan Village was completely restored from the war and enjoyed a larger boom than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were many users who became fans after watching the Tzedakah Guild’s battle through TV and the Internet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some of them tried to spy on Pagma’s Descendant, but there was nothing to worry about. It was impossible to obtain a clue about Grid just by looking at the video, and Grid’s residence was Winston, not Bairan. It was futile placing spies in Bairan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If the current trend continues, the population will exceed 12,000. It’s expected to steadily increase in the future."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“12,000? Can the size of this village accommodate that many people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We need to expand the scale of the village by raising our internal affairs. But to do that, money is required, and we don’t have any at the moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The tax revenue will naturally increase as the population grows, so won’t time solve the insufficient funds? Isn’t it better to invest in internal affairs afterwards, instead of getting into debt?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There is no need to be in debt. Most of the new migrants have a very good feeling towards us. If we get our fan club to donate money to us, we will be able to grow our internal affairs faster than expected.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh...! The women’s cries filled the street whenever I walk through the village, are they my fans? Puhahat~!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They can’t be called fans but... Anyway Vantner, you are pretty popular. It seems that people liked the appearance of you trying your best to protect Jishuka.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh, really? There will be more requests for broadcasts in the future. I have to quickly earn money and pay Grid for the armor! Puhahat~!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The atmosphere of the Tzedakah Guild had been desperate when the large-scale army invaded and shattered the village. But now they were relaxed and in a better situation than before.&nbsp;</span><span style>As they were conversing happily, the quiet Faker said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is all thanks to Grid."</span></p>
 <p><span style>There wasn’t one person who denied the opinion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was big when Pon and Regas were tied up. If Grid hadn’t appeared on time and helped us, we would have all died. We might’ve managed to stop the Yatan Church if we fought hard, but the damage would’ve been too big.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I never dreamed that Grid would make such a big difference on the battlefield when he was brought on as a blacksmith.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought with Grid’s nature, he would ignore us when we were in a crisis. But he helped us. I was honestly impressed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"When I first saw him, Grid was incredibly selfish, but not anymore. His personality has become softer and there is some sense of fellowship. He is growing as a colleague we can depend on in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We should try to be colleagues that Grid can rely on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s reliability and affinity with the guild members reached its peak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am proud to see that Grid is being recognized.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ibellin had admired Grid since he smashed the Giant Guild in Winston.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Did you see the broadcast? I watched it a few days ago and Grid really looked like the protagonist of a movie. I got goosebumps.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laella currently wasn’t a singer, but she used to be a global idol.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I also saw the video. I didn’t know it at the time of the battle, but Grid was really nice on the video. In particular, the scene of him showing up to save Jishuka was fantastic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bairan Village Castle’s meeting room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guild members sitting around the big round table turned their gaze towards Jishuka. Then they spoke with playful expressions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"At that time, Jishuka looked different from usual.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right? She seemed to be looking at Grid like a woman. She was blushing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Master, are you attracted to Grid~?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka didn’t deny the giggling guild member’s words.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was true that her heart started beating quickly the moment Grid saved her from death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...He was definitely cool. But he’s already married.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka muttered in a small voice with a sad expression. Nobody heard her and kept on talking, with the exception of Faker, who had excellent hearing due to the nature of the assassin class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Master is finally interested in the opposite sex.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faker gave a rare smile and changed the atmosphere.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I heard that the blacksmith in Bairan Village has become an advanced blacksmith.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The topic changed in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah, I heard that as well. Isn’t it strange? An old man who was a beginner blacksmith for decades suddenly became an advanced blacksmith in a few days?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know why, but it’s still good. Thanks to that, the production speed and quality of the weapons have greatly improved, so it is easier to replenish the soldiers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“An advanced blacksmith... I’m looking forward to the synergy with the genius miner kid recruited by Grid a week ago.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If the power of those two are added to Grid’s power... Kouh, it is big. The day when the guild will have the power of an army will someday arrive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Tzedakah Guild was a collection of talented people dreaming about the future.&nbsp;</span><span style>They became the strongest guild since the recruitment of Grid, so their potential for growth was endless.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Bairan Village’s library.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...What am I doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The boy genius, Minor, was exhausted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the past week, he had been reading 16 hours a day and was mentally at his limit.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had never picked up a book and now he had to read two books a day?&nbsp;</span><span style>In the beginning, he only read books about minerals, so he was interested. But now he had to read books related to geography.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Minor got up from his seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am a miner! Why does a future king’s miner have to read?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A knight noticed his shouting.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Have you forgotten that this is a solemn place? Be quiet and study hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how much of a genius he was, Minor was still just a boy. He couldn’t take it and eventually wept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is torture. Why do I have to stay here all day reading books? Huh? Sob sob.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is Viscount Grid’s command. Follow it without complaining.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka’s knight had no mercy. He thoroughly performed his supervisor role.&nbsp;</span><span style>Minor became filled with more spite with every day that passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grid, that bad man... I will get revenge later on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Smith’s smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are my ears ticklish?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was disassembling, reassembling and enhancing his equipment, like the Holy Light Armor and Dainsleif, in order to increase his understanding.&nbsp;</span><span style>Smith approached him with a frown and suggested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you need an earbud?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Please act moderately.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He still felt insecure about Smith’s gay tendencies. Grid wanted to leave here as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i> <i><span style>Kaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He kept hammering. Grid was better at disassembling and reassembling items than before, then he turned his attention towards the entrance of the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I have completed my mission and returned.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Mongolian man appeared with perfect timing.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Huroi.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the last 12 days, he had led Jude and 100 soldiers to hunt the frostlight orcs, and now he had returned.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was finally time for Grid to go back to Winston.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smiled at this thought and welcomed Huroi. Then he observed Jude using the Ruler’s Sword, which he still hadn’t returned to Jishuka in the name of finding another talent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Jude</span></p>
 <p><span style>Age: 25 &nbsp;&nbsp;Gender: Male</span></p>
 <p><span style>Occupation: Captain of Winston’s 13th Hundred Man Unit</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level: 120</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strength: 1,016/2,080 &nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 490/908&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agility: 54/330 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligence: 11/20</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skills: Snatch the Enemy’s Weapon and Use it as a Weapon (S). Silence (A). I have no Idea (SS-).</span></p>
 <p><span style>A rare fool born in Winston. When it comes to strength, he doesn’t fall behind anyone. He is a natural warrior who doesn’t know fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, his brain is less evolved. No matter how hard he tries, he can never climb to a higher position. It is close to a miracle that he became the captain of a hundred man unit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He gained 17 levels and his stats increased by 280.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A user gained 10 fixed stat points with every level up, while a NPC randomly gained between 6~20 stat points.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jude was a superb NPC who got at least 16 stat points every time his level went up, so it was a truly dazzling growth.&nbsp;</span><span style>But there was one annoying part.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Isn’t his intelligence the same?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid frowned for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'In the first place, his maximum intelligence is 20... He’s so stupid that I won’t expect anything from him. Let’s check the details of his skills.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Snatch the Enemy’s Weapon and Use it as a Weapon]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: S</span></p>
 <p><span style>A talent that one person per 100,000 people will have.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If you take advantage of a chance, you can take the enemy’s weapon and use it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Silence]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: A&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The default rating of the ‘Silence’ skill is S-grade. However, the intelligence of the owner is so low that it is demoted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A talent that one person per 100,000 people will have.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those with this talent are very reticent and don’t boast about what they see and hear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>In general, your loyalty to your superiors is high, so it’s rare for you to betray your masters. Most stewards have this skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[I have no Idea]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: SS-</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Jude only skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You are ignorant and brave. In order to fulfill your mission, you will even run into a fire pit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You will never feel the fear state. However, the chances of receiving other status conditions will increase by 50%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If you face a crisis, there is a high chance to activate the ‘Fight Desperately’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Fight Desperately]</span></p>
 <p><span style>For three minutes, damage will be reduced by 50% and attack power will increase by 80%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The level of the soldiers rose by an average of 8~10 and there are no victims.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Overall, it was a great performance.&nbsp;</span><span style>His plan to make Jude’s Hundred Man Unit an elite unit of Winston had taken one step forward.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid smiled and reached out to Huroi.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi thought that Grid was going to pat him on the shoulders.&nbsp;</span><span style>But that wasn’t it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about the sylphid scales?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi couldn’t hide his sadness and searched his inventory. Then he pulled out the 28 sylphid scales that he worked hard to earn over the past 28 days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am finally able to create the invisibility cloak.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid happily collected it and said.&nbsp;</span><span style>“As you may have noticed, the sylphid scales are items not easily traded between users. So it is difficult to determine how much to pay you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His words were the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The frostlight orcs weren’t well known and their habitat was so cold that most users didn’t hunt there. It was much more beneficial to hunt other monsters of the same level. The drop rate of the sylphid scales was also very low, so its value wasn’t known.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, Grid meant to pay for it in a different way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huroi, I heard that you obtained the Sword Mastery skill after acquiring your second class?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Okay, I will make a sword for you. Let’s return to Winston first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid returned the Ruler’s Sword to Jishuka, said goodbye to the guild members and left Bairan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, he took Minor with him.&nbsp;</span><span style>The guild questioned Grid’s strange way of educating Minor, but Grid had asked Minor to be assigned to him and they trusted him.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>『 Satisfy’s national competition is to be held in three days, and the number of tourists visiting South Korea is estimated to reach 800,000. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Considering that tourists for the Olympics averages between 200,000 and 500,000, the popularity of Satisfy’s national competition is well above the Olympics and the ratings will be very high... &nbsp;』</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time passed quickly when one was busy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Four months passed in Satisfy time, while it was time for the national competition in reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this the last one?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The north of the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A black-haired man was standing in front of a small cave in an unexplored forest. Then a boy with a sharp impression, who seemed like he would become handsome when older, replied gruffly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, you wait here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black-haired man, Grid, pulled out something from his inventory.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a white hooded zip up worn by young people in modern society.&nbsp;</span><span style>An amazing thing happened once he wore it.&nbsp;</span><span style>The man suddenly disappeared. It was a sight that seemed like a lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the boy, Minor, didn’t seem surprised at all. He looked like he was tired and leaned back against the entrance of the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then after a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge explosion sounded from the deepest part of the cave.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was like an earthquake, causing the forest outside the cave to shake and for birds to fly into the air.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>But Minor didn’t wake up. How much sleep was he lacking to be so deeply asleep?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eek?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The orc group that ran away with fright because of the earthquake stopped as they found Minor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Uwekukukrerek (Grab that puny human kid).”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ekkukikuk? Eekuik (An emergency food supply? It’s a good idea).”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ssik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The orcs exchanged sly smiles and quietly pulled out their axes. Then they were surprised as they cautiously approached Minor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I can avoid the golems’ gazes, but it’s impossible to stop Braham’s trap. It seems that Stealth is useless against it. I feel bad every time my passive disappears.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eek?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of the sleeping boy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Someone’s voice was heard, but there was no one there.&nbsp;</span><span style>The orcs doubted their ears and rubbed their eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Suddenly, a shark-shaped sword popped out of thin air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kiek!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood spurted at the same time from the five astonished orcs.&nbsp;</span><span style>A man slowly appeared in front of the orcs.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Grid wearing the Hooded Zip Up.&nbsp;</span><span style>He whistled as he held an egg shaped lump in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“With this, I have recovered all the pavranium in the Eternal Kingdom. Okay, I should go back now.” (TL: This doesn't mean he recovered all the pavranium on the continent, only the ones in the Eternal Kingdom)</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he wanted to acquire all the pavranium that Braham hid around the continent, he needed to revive Braham after receiving the blessing from God Yatan. But it was currently impossible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So Grid tried to figure out a different approach.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was to raise Minor’s intelligence, maximize his minerals detection ability, and then use him to search directly for the pavranium.&nbsp;</span><span style>These actions were enough to stimulate Braham.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Pagma’s Descendant has started questioning my identity? Then I have to take the next step.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy’s team manager, Yoon Nahee reported it to Chairman Lim Cheolho.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The emergence conditions for a new legendary class, Braham’s Descendant, has been achieved.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lim Cheolho enjoyed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The truth that Braham is a wicked liar has finally been grasped by Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...It seems unlikely.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yoon Nahee replied to Lim Cheolho with an embarrassed expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha! That friend is still the same. His name is on the national competition’s list, so it will be a lot of fun to watch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The person who registered his name on the list isn’t him, but Yura, who is backed by the Korean government. It is unlikely that he will participate in the national competition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lim Cheolho gave a meaningful smile.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Is it really like that?"</span></p>
