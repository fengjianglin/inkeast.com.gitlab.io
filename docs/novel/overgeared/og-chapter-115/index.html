 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>A hunting ground near Winston that was a favourite for level 100 users.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh? What’s that?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The users struggling with monsters noticed a black dot approaching in the sky. Then they started murmuring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s too big to be a bird. Is it perhaps a griffon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are no griffon habitats in the area. But I don’t think there is anything else besides a griffon... It’s serious if it is a griffon. Will we die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"U-Uh? A person?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dot soon got closer. Surprisingly, the identity was revealed to be a user.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow... A second advancement magician.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s my first time seeing a ranker up close. So cool!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is that thing shining next to him? A pet?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A man in a red cloak was flying through the sky! The object following him flashed in the blazing sun. The identity of the person was Grid. He flew through the sky without stopping and soon disappeared from the sight of the users.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he reached a wide forest and stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m out of mana.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had already taken one mana potion. Then his mana became depleted again before the potion cooldown was over.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was forced to land on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Winston is beyond this forest. I can recover some mana while walking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a deep forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid measured the distance to Winston and looked at the frostlight orc chief’s helmet. After this forest, he would encounter a lot of people. The helmet was the sign of the Human Slaughterer so there would be a fuss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have to quickly replace this helmet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid once again vowed to wear an awesome helmet that was suitable for a mythical hero, while the pavranium circled his head.&nbsp;</span><span style>It seemed to be in a good mood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you excited to get fresh air after being trapped in a box for 300 years?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid asked while walking. But the pavranium didn’t answer. It was natural. It had a will, but it was just a mineral. It couldn’t carry out a conversation.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid continued to talk to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But aren’t you unbelievably fast? My flight speed was 100 meters in 7 seconds, yet you managed to keep up? Do you have tireless stamina as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid looked at the pavranium with affection.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was natural for a blacksmith to feel favorable towards the best minerals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuwooh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give it to me! Human! Your life! Flesh and bone! Separate!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was carrying out a pleasant conversation (?) with pavranium when he was interrupted by sturdy orcs. They were armed with crude red leather and had a large wolf with them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Considering that they spoke the human language fairly well, they were obviously the wolf fang orcs known for being powerful among the various orcs.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Grrrung.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The wolf shook its nose. It was clearly reacting to the bloody smell coming from Malacus’ Cloak. It smelled the blood and led the orcs here.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuuong!</span></i> <i><span style>Kung!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kyaooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Various monsters such as ogres, goblins and snakes moved through the forest.&nbsp;</span><span style>In an instant, Grid was surrounded by 100 enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow... What is this?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The users hunting nearby were surprised by the turmoil and came running.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the first time they saw all types of monsters focusing on just one person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That person is screwed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did he do wrong that angered so many mobs?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Tsk tsk~ purposely angering mobs like this~ he should hunt in moderation~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people weren’t aware of the situation and talked among themselves.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Syuok!</span></i> <i><span style>Syuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The goblin archers in the rear shot at Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The users saw the dark rain of arrows covering the sky and knew that Grid would die.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid’s high stats made him similar to a level 200 combat class. In addition, he’d observed Jishuka’s expert archery, so the goblin’s clumsy firing seemed like a kid’s prank to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are there any idiots who would be killed by these arrows?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid laughed while holding the Ideal Dagger and aimed Wind Blast at the arrows.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid invested all the points he gained reaching level 114 into strength. The damage of Wind Blast was proportional to his attack power.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now that the power of Grid’s Wind Blast was upgraded, the level 100 goblins couldn’t endure it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kiek!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kyak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rain of arrows was neutralized and the goblin archers who had their arms or legs cut off collapsed with a scream.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the signal for all monsters to simultaneously attack Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wearing the cloak was worthwhile!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hunting had a direct correlation to levels!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid swapped to Dainsleif and drank a mana potion. &nbsp;Then he used Wave and fired it all over the place. The monsters approaching him simultaneously collapsed. The ogres were durable enough to survive, but they were hit by Wave and slowed down by the debuff. They couldn’t threaten Grid with their slow movements and struggled in vain.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeok!</span></i> <i><span style>Pajik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Keok!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puoook!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kkieek!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wave killed most of the monsters in one blow, while Grid subdued the rest by killing them one by one.&nbsp;</span><span style>Meanwhile, the few remaining goblins fired arrows with all their might. A few arrows actually flew directly at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Che!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was too caught up in killing and belatedly noticed the arrows. He braced himself for the pain. But the arrows didn’t reach Grid’s body.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwajak!</span></i> <i><span style>Kwajajajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Pavranium rotated around Grid’s body and destroyed all the arrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was it normal for a class to have a strong offense and defense?&nbsp;</span><span style>The swordsman with the black greatsword killed the monsters with overwhelming attack power, while the metal pet protected the body. This balance seemed perfect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s amazing... Excuse me, but what is your class?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid swept away the rest of the monsters with pavranium’s help and started picking up items. This gave the users a chance to barrage him with questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is that gold object floating next to you? Is that a pet? Or maybe a new style of armor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mister, how about you? Aren’t you actually a high level user? Why is a high level user hunting in a place like this? Is there anything good here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mister~?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mister, are you deaf? Answer us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The users here saw that Grid was in a crisis and no one tried to help.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, Grid was inherently unfriendly towards people. He had no obligation to answer the users’ questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is too annoying. Fly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid cried out to the annoying users and used Fly. Then he literally flew away in the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The users left behind were stunned and could only blink.&nbsp;</span><span style>After a few minutes, people in various communities around the world became interested in something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I saw a swordsman flying.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a place called Popo Forest near Winston. I hunted with my friend there and saw a high level user slaughtering mobs. Then after wiping out all the mobs, he flew away. A swordsman was flying?</span></p>
 <p><span style>RnfkRk's comment: &nbsp;ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ A swordsman can’t fly ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durururubam’s reply: A swordsman was flying? I’m a priest but I can’t use Heal. ㅂㅅ</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon’s Right Arm’s comment: Kukuk... That swordsman was me... Kukukuk... I was careful but I never thought someone would witness it... Yare yare...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zkxhfm's comment: Liar’s disease.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Admiral's comment: Did you mother eat seaweed soup on the day you were born?</span></p>
 <p><span style>30,000 won Salary’s comment: Don’t write shit just to gain traffic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a terrible method.&nbsp;</span><span style>The users abused the poster who wrote about the flying swordsman, so the other witnesses no longer bragged about it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thus, it was a temporary problem and the topic wasn’t mentioned any longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the meantime, Grid arrived at Khan’s smithy and ran straight to the furnace. He placed the pavranium in the furnace and controlled the temperature in order to determine the melting point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is 1,900 degrees.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pavranium was so small that it was instantly smelted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to carry it around in an egg shape until I make the Vessel of the Soul, so I should transform it into something else...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the volume was too small to produce a lot of items. The pavranium wasn’t enough to even make a dagger. In order to make an item, Grid would have to mix in other materials. However, he didn’t want to contaminate the pure pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s be satisfied with changing the shape.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After being with the pavranium for a while, he noticed that it had a propensity to stay by the owner’s side for protection. He needed to take advantage of this feature.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A shape more suitable for defense than an egg... Ah!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid recalled Malacus’ shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He formed a disc-shaped shield with magic power at each attacked point, effectively blocking the attack...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid started carefully hammering. Then after a while, the pavranium became two disks. Each disc was slightly smaller than the palms of an adult.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Okay."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid finished the discs. The discs floated in the air before starting to revolve around Grid again. Grid felt reassured. It seemed like he could be protected from most attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Jishuka arrived at the smithy. Grid told her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shoot an arrow at me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hurry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hrmm, okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka saw the golden discs circling around Grid and noticed his intentions. Then she fired an arrow without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Syuk!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was a beautiful sight.&nbsp;</span><span style>The two discs around Grid’s body flew in the direction of the arrow and fully stopped it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is great...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka’s expression wasn’t good, compared to her admiring words.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her ego was bruised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s that simple to block? Did I shoot it too weakly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, wait a minute...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was scared. Jishuka fired again, but this time she pulled the bowstring back to the maximum.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Swaeek!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Aaaagh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The arrow that contained all her power flew towards Grid’s death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...Hah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid and Jishuka let out a sound at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka’s was a displeased sneer, while Grid was filled with delight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This arrow can even pierce through steel... Isn’t this extremely durable? Like Braham said, it’s the peak of all minerals.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right. The golden discs had perfectly blocked the arrow fired by Jishuka.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the impact was quite strong, so it couldn’t move for a little while after the point of collision. Then it started moving again after two seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If it receives excessive shock, it is immobilized for two seconds...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Jishuka continuously fired her strength arrows, the two discs wouldn’t be able to completely protect his body.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid felt the need to complete this quest and obtain the rest of the pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But... If there are 27 more pavranium of this size, it won’t be enough to make armor... Well, it isn’t a problem. I can still use it.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was flexible.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rather than striving to make a complete item with a limited volume of pavranium, it was best to maximize its efficiency by making several small items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'For example, attaching a blade made of pavranium to armor. The blade would move on its own to protect me from attacks I can’t react to, or if the enemy attacks me from an unexpected angle.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>An item that could move on its own! If he cleared this quest and gained the remaining pavranium, he would be able to write the true history of the power of items.&nbsp;</span><span style>As Grid was overwhelmed with pleasure, someone knocked on the door of the smithy. Jishuka asked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These discs, they don’t need to be exposed to other people right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Of course. Isn’t it common sense to hide it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid placed the discs in his inventory. Then the doors of the smithy opened.&nbsp;</span><span style>One knight and dozens of soldiers entered.&nbsp;</span><span style>They politely saluted to Grid and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Earl Steim is looking for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Earl Steim? Lady Irene’s father?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? Okay! Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why was the master of the north, one of the big powers in the Eternal Kingdom, looking for Grid? In the first place, it was strange that the high level NPC knight, famous for their arrogance, would act so respectfully towards a user.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka watched the knight and soldiers escort Grid from the smithy and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner’s armor production request needed to be delayed for a while.</span></p>
