 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>At the time of the National Competition’s opening video shoot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A total of 224 players from 32 countries gathered in France, where the S.A. Group had created a temporary server.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were the top performers that represented each country and Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>The most prominent person among them was the 1st ranked Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wow, being able to see Kraugel in real life, I am really rewarded for being a ranker.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s surprisingly young. He isn’t even 30 years old and is already at the peak of two billion users...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’ve been a fan of Kraugel for a long time. Can we bribe him to enter our guild?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If he was easily bribed, he would’ve already joined a group. Most of us here are probably fans of Kraugel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel’s greatness was better known by the rankers than anyone else.&nbsp;</span><span style>The higher the level, the harder it was to raise the level, so rankers could experience it more than ordinary users.&nbsp;</span><span style>For the rankers, Kraugel was a transcendent being who was beyond the realm of a genius.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Buzz buzz.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Like children who had never seen a celebrity, the rankers kept their eyes on Kraugel and made a fuss.&nbsp;</span><span style>Most of them wanted to speak to Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, no one dared to approach Kraugel. They just gazed at the distant sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the same with Zibal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am shrinking back...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zibal.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the leader of the Snake Guild and 2nd on the unified rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had failed against Overgeared, but there were few people who could deny that he was one of the best in the world.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yet even he flinched in front of Kraugel.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the midst of this awkward atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone reached out to say hello to Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The rankers laughed at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The Overgeared Guild is trying to cling to Kraugel.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He will be despised by Kraugel.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rankers didn’t know about the relationship between Grid and Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>They thought that Kraugel would show contempt to Grid, who would become ashamed.&nbsp;</span><span style>But they were wrong.&nbsp;</span><span style>Surprisingly, Kraugel welcomed Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It seemed like the two men already knew each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It has been a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you been well? I saw the rankings list. You’ve widened the gap with the 2nd place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is all thanks to you. The performance of White Fang has been upgraded, increasing the efficiency of hunting and raids. Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I ought to be thanking you. Thanks to you, I was able to visit the Behen Archipelago and grow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Were you able to reach the 30th island?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 30th island.&nbsp;</span><span style>The trials of the past were reproduced, causing Kraugel to be eliminated.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Grid gave a shocking answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’ve just arrived at the 40th island.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel’s expression stiffened.&nbsp;</span><span style>He acknowledged Grid’s abilities to reach an area before him, but this frankly exceeded expectations. He felt like he had been hit in the back of the head with a hammer.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it was a positive stimulus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s the first time I’m worse than anyone else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Interesting.&nbsp;</span><span style>Existences that could drive him forward, how many were there?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smiled meaningfully and told Kraugel the truth,&nbsp;</span><span style>"I didn’t set a high record because I’m better than you. The trials of the Behen Archipelago are just suited for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t need to be humble.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid and Kraugel suddenly stopped talking while walking next to each other.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because they felt the others following them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There are many ears listening. Tell me the details next time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid called out as Kruagel was saying goodbye to him.&nbsp;</span><span style>He declared with a provocative gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Have you seen the plan for the opening? The last scene ends with me attacking you. I will do my best, so be careful not to die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was curious.&nbsp;</span><span style>As his skills grew, who would prevail between him and Kraugel?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s eyes blazed with determination and Kraugel nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m looking forward to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>And on this day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Transcended Link.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>One of Grid’s ultimate skills, Transcended Link was avoided by Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was exactly 20 of them.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t frustration that Grid felt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I still have a long way to go.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had to keep growing.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was full of motivation, while Kraugel felt admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The orbit is sharper.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the spar that occurred two months ago in Satisfy time, the Transcended Link sent by Grid hadn’t given Kraugel any sense of threat.&nbsp;</span><span style>It aimed in a straight line towards the target, making it easy for Kraugel to read and avoid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But this Transcended Link was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>The orbit wasn’t in a straight line, with different directions mixed together.&nbsp;</span><span style>If the orbit became even more irregular...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It will be very interesting.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Among the players, the only ones who could provoke him were the malicious ones.&nbsp;</span><span style>A prime example was Agnus.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was really positive that he met someone with pure intentions.&nbsp;</span><span style>The more time he spent with Grid, the more convinced he was that he would develop further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Also.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t easily overlook the fact that Grid was ahead of him in the Behen Archipelago.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel swung White Fang at Grid, who blocked it. This verified Kraugel’s determination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I also need a new challenge.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would keep developing until the National Competition began.&nbsp;</span><span style>He promised himself as he received a signal stating that the filming was over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kraugel, it is nice to meet you. I am the 2nd ranked Zibal and I’m just below you on the rankings.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zibal approached and held out a hand to shake.&nbsp;</span><span style>He thought that Kraugel would accept his greeting after talking so nicely with Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel sent him a sorry look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My mother is calling.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of more than 200 rankers and 100 S.A. Group officials.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel refused to shake hands with Zibal and logged out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pfff!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zibal’s face became hot as Chris started to laugh.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>A shabby housing complex on the outskirts of Moscow, Russia.&nbsp;</span><span style>One of the crumbling houses was Kraugel’s residence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was a Koryoin (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koryo-saram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koryo-saram</a>) who grew up in poverty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to this, he was the target of prejudice and discrimination, suffering many crises in his life.&nbsp;</span><span style>But thanks to the teachings of his kind and wise mother, he didn’t give up and was able to enter a prestigious university, eventually getting a good job.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was a gigantic existence and he could never pay back what she had done for him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Recently, his mother had become thinner.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pipipipipi!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The emergency light installed on the capsule started flashing.&nbsp;</span><span style>As soon as he heard it, Kraugel logged out of the game and left the capsule.&nbsp;</span><span style>The place he headed was his mother’s bedroom.&nbsp;</span><span style>She had an incurable disease that couldn’t be cured with modern medicine, Alzheimer’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He tried to invite the world’s best medical staff with the money he earned, but his mother’s condition didn’t improve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"My son! Where is my son?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His mother gazed at Kraugel with a mad look.&nbsp;</span><span style>She threw things around her in a rage, until Kraugel hugged her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't worry, calm down. You will be able to meet your son soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel never smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to cure his mother’s illness, he quit his job and devoted himself to Satisfy, never giving up.&nbsp;</span><span style>The wealth he accumulated through Satisfy was poured into his mother’s treatment, and he believed that one day his mother’s warm touch would return.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Until then, in order to endure without despair, Kraugel watched his mother with all his heart, while feeling pleasure playing Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>He always committed himself to everything, so the negative thoughts didn’t invade his life.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>『 We have learned one thing from the fact that the Silver Knights Guild was absorbed into Overgeared. The Overgeared Guild has a total of three territories. Reidan, Bairan, and Cork Island. 』&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Isn’t it unheard of for one guild to be running three territories? There is speculation that the Overgeared Guild is accumulating a lot of wealth. What do you think about this 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Of course they are making a huge amount of money. Reidan is a large city, Bairan has many hunting grounds with various levels and Cork Island is famous for its tourist attraction. They will be sweeping up a huge amount of taxes every month. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 The Overgeared Guild’s funding ability will evolve every day. At this moment, there are many reasons why so many players want to join Overgeared. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The opening video for the 2nd National Competition was available.&nbsp;</span><span style>The media focusing on Kraugel started to shift their attention to Grid and Overgeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because of the lack of information on Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to Lauel’s plan, the Overgeared Guild became a hot topic and their popularity rose every day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There are too many fanciful stories. Overgeared is rich? Nonsense. We are living in poverty every day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner snorted.&nbsp;</span><span style>All the revenue was poured into Reidan, so it was funny that the experts were predicting that they were a rich guild when they were actually suffering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Reidan is so isolated that there is a lot of futile speculation. It is unlikely that anyone can guess the actual situation of Reidan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was very satisfied.&nbsp;</span><span style>As the reputation of Overgeared expanded, the number of hostile forces would reduce while talents would come swarming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“By the way, when are we departing for the Behen Archipelago?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Regas asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was always dreaming about becoming stronger, so he had great enthusiasm towards the Behen Archipelago.&nbsp;</span><span style>Most of the Overgeared members were the same.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel rose from his seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We will depart in an hour. Sticks will guide us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grid will stay in Reidan for a few days. He wants to try the combination of blacksmithing and alchemy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Will combining alchemy and blacksmithing recreate the dwarves’ unique techniques?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is a long story for later. For the moment, adding a unique option to an item is the limit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel believed that this one option might upset the battlefield.</span></p>
