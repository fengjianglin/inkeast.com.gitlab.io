 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Most gamers liked to dream, but they became frustrated by their talent and environmental limitations, causing them to abandon their dreams.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From a general point of view, Grid was also like this.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid obtained an opportunity after hard work. He had been trying his best ever since becoming Pagma’s Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted to escape his poverty, wanted to show off, and then wanted to overcome his inferiority.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now he didn’t want to lose what he had obtained, and also to protect his precious ones.&nbsp;</span><span style>His aspirations were refined in a more upright direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t sit still while his colleagues were at risk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Login."</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Behen Archipelago, the 40th island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks was drinking a blue coconut.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why did you come back so soon this time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid cut right to the point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Instant dun... No, can you forcefully enter a place where access is limited, like the Behen Archipelago?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No.&nbsp;</span><span style>Anyone would give that answer.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid was full of hope.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sticks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He was called a sage because he accumulated more knowledge and wisdom than others.&nbsp;</span><span style>Indeed, Sticks met Grid’s expectations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There is one way. But it is likely to fail and I can only try it twice a year.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Can you give it a try for me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Can I ask about the situation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was his benefactor and had infinite appeal.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Sticks couldn’t blindly help without knowing the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There are people who I want to protect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid gave a clear and brief explanation.&nbsp;</span><span style>His eyes were deep, warm and bright.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sticks didn’t inquire anymore after hearing the explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"First, let’s get out of here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks got up from his seat.&nbsp;</span><span style>The purification of the Contaminated Behen Archipelago?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was better for Grid to solve his problem first before returning.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid would be able to concentrate more.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The members of the vampire expedition were as followed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pon, Regas, Faker, Jishuka, Yura, Huroi, Peak Sword, Vantner, Toban, Zednos, Ibellin, and Toon.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were the elites of Overgeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since raiding Elfin Stone and growing from the 10th vampire city, they were filled with confidence.&nbsp;</span><span style>With the exception of Marie Rose, who Grid told them to be careful of, they were convinced that there weren’t any vampires they couldn’t raid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now they greatly regretted challenging the 9th city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Dammit, I’m lost at this age.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 9th city was a castle.&nbsp;</span><span style>The castle was several times larger than Reidan, the second largest city in the Eternal Kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style>Traps were set up everywhere, the corridors were like labyrinths, and the Overgeared members unintentionally became scattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ka~kung.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon and Vantner were separated from the group.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were moving between a forest of pillars when a playful woman’s voice was heard from behind them.&nbsp;</span><span style>The surprised Pon and Vantner swung their weapons, but they only hurt the pillars and felt a pain from their wrists.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh! This nasty woman!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner’s bald head turned red. He was like an octopus, so Pon burst out laughing.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner’s head became even redder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This situation isn’t funny!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should look in the mirror. It’s impossible not to laugh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner and Pon were still at odds.&nbsp;</span><span style>It happened when the agitated Vantner was going to grab Pon’s collar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you’re bored, then play with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The playful voice of a woman was heard from the ceiling instead of behind a pillar.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pon was still being held by the collar, but stabbed upwards with his spear. Vantner let go and grabbed his axe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They leapt towards the vampire baron, Ran.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The sharp fingernails moved with high agility and scratched the chests of the two men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon and Vantner’s faces became irritated at their failed counterattack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huhuhut~ silly Brothers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ran hid herself in the darkness and taunted them, causing Vantner to grumble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wouldn’t Faker be a match for that woman?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I agree. If Faker was here, then we would be able to easily catch that woman instead of suffering like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That’s what I wanted to say!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them couldn’t work together and the number of wounds gradually increased.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ran’s laughter echoed in the darkness.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think this body will be hurt by that small dagger?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A large hall on the first floor of the castle.&nbsp;</span><span style>Faker had fallen into a trap and was fighting a vampire alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>Like his name, Mountain held an unusually large weapon and was covered with armor. The body of the vampire baron was as big as his name. He was at least 3m tall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Amazing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>His throwing skill wasn’t enough to get past the defense.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rare tension appeared on Faker’s face.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"This is the worst."</span></p>
 <p><span style>A corridor to the north of the castle’s first floor.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka and Zednos was isolated in the middle of it without any cover.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were vampire soldiers coming from both sides of the corridor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We can’t let them get here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka was an archer and Zednos was a magician.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were vulnerable when it came to close combat.&nbsp;</span><span style>They shot arrows and magic to the other side of the hall to prevent vampires from approaching...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn humans!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The number of angry vampires didn’t show signs of diminishing.&nbsp;</span><span style>Zednos saw that they were gradually narrowing the distance and clicked his tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The average level is 20 levels higher than the vampires of the 10th city?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...I agree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two people felt desperate.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Is everybody safe?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas, Huroi, Peak Sword, Toban, Ibellin, and Toon.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were at the forefront of the party and was move towards the 2nd floor when they activated the ‘Teleportation Trap.’&nbsp;</span><span style>It was impossible for them to confirm if the colleagues left on the 1st floor were safe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I can’t see their health and location.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I think they are in danger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, Regas. This is why I told you to let Faker go first. Why were you in the front when you don’t have a searching ability?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...I’m sorry. I was so motivated that I moved ahead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go down to the 1st floor instead of blaming anyone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>He used to be the guild master of the Silver Knights Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>When he was serious, he showed a high leadership and judgment ability.&nbsp;</span><span style>The others were well aware of this fact and followed Peak Sword without saying anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there were people blocking the path to the 1st floor.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were three vampire barons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...This place is great.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the 10th city, one or two vampire barons emerged as intermediate bosses.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the 9th city contained an absurd number of vampire barons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Draw Sword, Annihilate.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sakak-!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword initiated the battle.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Demon Slayer, Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her level was 247.&nbsp;</span><span style>The level that the general public took two years to obtain was achieved in just seven months.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the result of the know-how from her 5th place ranking, a legendary class, and the best hunting ground that was the vampire cities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The present Yura was strong enough to compare with the main powers of Overgeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, her level wasn’t enough to deal with a vampire viscount alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is this your limit?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A viscount was far stronger than the vampire barons.&nbsp;</span><span style>The viscount, Tiramet, looked down at the kneeling Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was overflowing with magic power and his infinite physical strength made him arrogant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I was a bit nervous about the dirty bullets you shoot, but it isn’t interesting. A Demon Slayer is just this much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura asked Tiramet, who had spoken in a ridiculing tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know about a Demon Slayer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s impossible for me to not know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiramet raised his silver hair. Then he revealed a deep wound on his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was wounded by that guy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His killing intent rose.&nbsp;</span><span style>Tiramet’s hostility exploded as he thought about the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Woman who inherited that power. Today I will thoroughly step on you.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Like most vampires, Tiramet was good at magic and physical fighting.&nbsp;</span><span style>He used a style of fighting that weakened the enemy with magic and then ended it with physical attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t be hit by the same thing again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura cancelled the magic by shooting a purification bullet and immediately opened the distance. She narrowly avoided a flying kick and fired a bullet again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tatang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It hit.&nbsp;</span><span style>The bullet accurately hit between Tiramet’s eyes. It was a great marksmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Yura’s complexion was still pale.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was only level 247, so she couldn’t deal a big blow to a named level 360 boss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk...! Girl!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Demon Slayer’s attack was a deadly poison to demonkin.&nbsp;</span><span style>No matter the level difference, Tiramet felt a great deal of pain, so his anger soared into the sky.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Every time he waved his hand, black magic power struck to constrict Yura’s behavior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’ll break you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A smile broke out on Tiramet’s face because he was confident in his combat abilities.&nbsp;</span><span style>His kick flew out like lightning and aimed accurately at Yura’s face.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A sound rang out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Tiramet was convinced it was the sound of fragile human bones being broken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kukuk...! Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiramet stopped laughing while imagining brains pouring out of the dying human.&nbsp;</span><span style>He felt doubts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Where did the golden shield that appeared in front of his leg come from?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is this damn girl...!?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment that Tiramet backed away.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A storm of blue-black energy blades flew and covered Tiramet.&nbsp;</span><span style>Tiramet reflexively used a defense spell and was astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Strong...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a level of damage that couldn’t be defended against.&nbsp;</span><span style>Tiramet’s body became wounded as he moved backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What bastard?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately after the storm of blades finished, the outraged Tiramet tried to counterattack. He was about to use magic when he stopped.&nbsp;</span><span style>Four golden hands came flying over and bound his arms and legs!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiramet struggled to shake off the golden hands. But this wasn't an easy task. He had the advantage in power, but the dexterity of the fingers meant he couldn’t easily get rid of them.&nbsp;</span><span style>At that moment, a gap was revealed for a few seconds.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone was flying above Tiramet’s head.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a black haired human.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Linked Kill.”</span></p>
