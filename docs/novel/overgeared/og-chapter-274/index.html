 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Detecting the target. Predicting the risks.&nbsp;</span><span style>These were phrases that described the insight stat.&nbsp;</span><span style>Before meeting Piaro, Grid had only used insight to measure combat power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>But in fact, insight was an absolute factor that could elevate his combat power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, he could predict risks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You rat bastards!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could read the enemy’s movements.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t easily allow Kamiyan to attack him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He evaded or defended, then linked a counterattack.&nbsp;</span><span style>These were movements that Piaro had taught him several times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The efficient movements helped him draw out 100% of his abilities.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid dealt a strong punch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“K-Kuaaack! You bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan couldn’t believe it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rather than overwhelming an opponent who didn’t have a weapon, he was receiving damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The difference between me and this guy is so large? Something is wrong...! It can’t be!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan believed that the empire was the whole world.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was indifferent to the happenings of small kingdoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Therefore, he had no idea about Grid. He only knew about the first time Grid came to the Vatican.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was just someone who ‘barely’ defeated ex-pope Drevigo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But what was the truth?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had experience raiding bosses much more powerful than Drevigo.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Under the guidance of Piaro, he had fought Pagma’s clone 83 times.&nbsp;</span><span style>To be exact, Grid studied under Piaro, who was once the captain of the Red Knights.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wasn’t an opponent that the 30th knight Kamiyan could go against.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid provoked Kamiyan.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Is your sword just a decoration? Isn’t it disgraceful that you can’t even subdue a bare handed opponent?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shut up!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan lost his composure, then a gold spear suddenly flew and stabbed his chest.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because his movements had become bigger after falling for Grid’s provocation.&nbsp;</span><span style>This gave an advantage to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The ‘Vital Spot Detection’ of the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch combined with his high insight to create an explosive synergy.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this moment, Grid was the person controlling the puppet called Kamiyan.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peok!</span></i> <i><span style>Peeeeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The strongest martial artist, Regas.&nbsp;</span><span style>It might be awkward, but Grid could follow his movements.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sometimes short, sometimes cool, his powerful fists stretched out nonstop.&nbsp;</span><span style>The attacks that tenaciously aimed at the seams of his armor confused Kamiyan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Another five...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Grid punched once, his gloves intermittently emitted light.&nbsp;</span><span style>Once that happened, Kamiyan felt like he was struck five times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the effect of the ‘5 Joint Attacks’ attached to Holy Light Gloves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was actively relying on his items as always.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Swaeek!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lifael’s Spear shot like a bullet every time there was a gap.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the pinnacle of the power of items, a reproduction of a divine weapon made of pavranium.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unlike Grid’s bare hands, it dealt damage to Kamiyan that couldn’t be ignored.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 3,830 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Okay, this time it struck properly.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Lifael’s Spear (Reproduction)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: None</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attack Power: 101~730</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Divine Power +200</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Fixed damage of +1,500 on each attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a low probability of activating the ‘Light Wheel’ skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Attack power +20% against those with dark magic power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maybe by the blacksmith G, who is being reborn as a true legend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is a miniature version of one of the three divine artifacts of the Rebecca Church, Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is made from the legendary mineral with a a will, pavranium. Therefore, it has a strong tendency to protect its owner. It makes decisions and moves by itself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 14</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no handgrip on the spear, so people couldn’t use it directly. So it wasn’t classified as a weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style>It might be due to that, or because it had divine power, but Lifael’s Spear was free from the ban on weapons.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid aggressively took advantage of it. Kamiyan became increasingly injured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuaaah! Kill! I will kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, Kamiyan was planning to play with Grid slowly. Now he became irritated and impatiently used a skill.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Papat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan used Keen Senses and consecutively avoided Grid’s attack.&nbsp;</span><span style>His sword drew several lines without a time delay. It was the manifestation of Dual Cross Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was only four strokes, but the quickly was comparable to Link. This was followed by a wave of energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The red light from Grid’s eyes darkened.&nbsp;</span><span style>His high insight was warning him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can’t avoid it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Should he fight back right afterwards?&nbsp;</span><span style>No. Grid’s bare hands would only receive damage that way. It was too weak.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then,</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Crush it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid formed a fist.&nbsp;</span><span style>Confronting an aura blade with his bare hands, it was crazy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kamiyan believed that Grid’s fist would be torn into eight pieces.&nbsp;</span><span style>The millions of viewers watching the battle were the same.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it was too arrogant to judge a legend by a moderate genius.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a reason for Grid’s behavior that the public couldn’t imagine.&nbsp;</span><span style>The power of items.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the cross sword collided with Grid’s fist...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Flash!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There was a light from the ruby ring Grid was wearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The option effect of ‘Dark Bus’ Earring’ is activated, neutralizing the target skill.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan was shocked!</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Wow, what is that?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-The skill disappeared;;</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>No, in the first place, why is Grid’s control so good?</span></i> <i><span style>How can he punch back against such quick swordsmanship?</span></i> <i><span style>Is that really Grid?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>His agility is high.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-ㅇㅇ </span><i><span style>It seems like his agility is maximized by his gear.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The viewers admired it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I can’t avoid it, then I should use it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s expression shot through the magic ball was splendid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Take a good look.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s fist pierced through the cross sword and struck Kamiyan’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kamiyan staggered and Lifael’s Spear aimed towards him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid took out the Red Lightning Summoning Bead that he obtained from hunting the Frostlight Orc Chief in the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am the master of the Overgeared Guild.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared Guild was the strongest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Don’t look down on us!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a warning to the seven guilds who dared to invade Reidan while he was away. Then the red lightning bolt fell.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kurururung.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The red lightning bolt that fell from the sky was nestled in Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Additional lightning damage was added to the spear, which pierced Kamiyan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The red lightning adds 30% damage. The target has received an electric shock.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 17,300 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan screamed. It was the worst pain since the battle began.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now that he was in shock, it was a chance to deal a fatal injury.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid determined and activated Blacksmith’s Rage.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rather than using Grid’s Boots that maximized the power of a greatsword, Grid equipped Braham’s Boots.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he wore the Hooded Zip Up. His movement speed was increased by 40%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-Wait a minute...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan begged as he was faced with the evil red light, but it was useless.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unbreakable Justice, the skill that was learned by rescuing Huroi and acquiring the title of Apostle of Justice. It was expressed through Grid’s fist.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan couldn’t even scream.&nbsp;</span><span style>His head was struck and he was thrown into the smithy wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>His teeth were broken and blood covered the Slaughterer’s Mask.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The Holy Light Gloves’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘5 Joint Attacks’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 7,020 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeok!</span></i> <i><span style>Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Cracks started to appear on the wall of the smithy above where Kamiyan’s head had struck.&nbsp;</span><span style>This scene was proof of Grid’s strength, which exceeded the level of a human.&nbsp;</span><span style>But more than two-thirds of Kamiyan’s health still remained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the limit of bare fists.&nbsp;</span><span style>First of all, Kamiyan’s health and defense was too high.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He won’t be defeated unless he dies.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was another Red Knight in the distance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid would take full advantage of the lazy attitude of the knight who stood on the sidelines without participating.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid would kill Kamiyan before the knight intervened.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s fists continuously punched Kamiyan’s face. Grid’s damage and speed were enhanced by Blacksmith’s Rage, so he completely neutralized Kamiyan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kamiyan used Super Armor and tried to get away from Grid, but Dark Bus’ Ring neutralized it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This bastard is a dragon!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The golden spear, fast moving boots, ring that neutralized skills, gloves that hit several times, armor with overwhelming defense, and so on.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was covered with artifacts that appeared in legends. It was like an imperial treasury was walking around.&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to the short life span of humans, it was impossible to collect such artifacts in their entire life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan didn’t like Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the meantime, Grid’s punching continued.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The wall of the smithy completely collapsed.&nbsp;</span><span style>As the place to lean on disappeared, Kamiyan fell down and Grid’s knee hit his jaw.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Lifael’s Spear flew towards Kamiyan and wounded him,</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puoook!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Blood scattered all over the remnants of the smithy. It was a scene reminiscent of a battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>-Wow...</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-God...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This strength was beyond common sense.&nbsp;</span><span style>After the golem invasion, Grid had grown much more aware from the public’s eyes. He seemed to have also overcome his only weakness, control.&nbsp;</span><span style>Items, skills, stats and now control, Grid was becoming truly perfect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I had to change my underwear.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I’m wearing a diaper.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>But isn’t a Red Knight weaker than the rumors?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>This is the 30th knight?</span></i> <i><span style>It is said that they are strong according to their number.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--ㅇㅇ</span><i><span style>The single numbers must be a real wall.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>What? I was almost scared of Grid again.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I am scared.</span></i><span style>ㅡㅡ</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>So that’s the 30th knight?</span></i> <i><span style>Even other rankers can defeat him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>No.</span></i> <i><span style>Grid is using his bare hands.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>What bare hands?</span></i> <i><span style>He has the golden spear.</span></i> <i><span style>Isn’t that a weapon?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There were dozens of chat messages per second in the OGC web channel chat window. The chat administrators tried to restrain abusive users, but were forced to give up halfway.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, the TV channel’s ratings were exceeding 30%. The ratings soared in real time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was 6:20 p.m. on a Saturday.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was prime time with various popular programs, so this was a phenomenal record for a cable channel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Indeed, Grid’s power on audience ratings is beyond imagination.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was difficult to predict how the ratings would go up.&nbsp;</span><span style>But there was one problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isn’t this too cruel?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We will be hit with a warning. We might have to stop broadcasting for a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s battle style wasn’t good for minors to watch.&nbsp;</span><span style>The opponent was an NPC, but Grid kept smiling as he hit the vital points.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was called a psychopath for a reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The team members were concerned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will take responsibility for everything. Don’t worry and keep broadcasting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His broadcaster’s blood was boiling.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would take responsibility for any repercussions, even if he needed to take off his clothes.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would write a new legend in the broadcasting world.</span></p>
