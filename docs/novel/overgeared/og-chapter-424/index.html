 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Ture Hotel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hotel where Russia, Brazil, and Japan were staying had a special area.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a capsule room limited for just the National Competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The representatives from various countries could play Satisfy any time they wanted in their hotels.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel visited this place.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was 14 hours and 23 minutes remaining until the start of day two of the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the meantime, Kraugel planned to raise his level in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Most representatives were exploring Paris or unburdening themselves with drinking, but Kraugel couldn’t afford to enjoy the present.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His only aim was to win the National Competition, and he would do his best to achieve this goal.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel was about to sit in the capsule when someone called to him.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Alexander, one of the representatives of Russia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"So what if you play games until you die? In the end, it’s about winning the gold medals.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alexander moved in front of Kraugel. He had a height of 190cm and a muscular figure, making him look threatening to anyone.&nbsp;</span><span style>His thick finger poked Kraugel’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The sky above the sky? Stop fooling around. In the end, because of your incompetence, Russia missed the gold medal and you won’t be able to fix your mother’s illness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The skinhead Alexander treated yellow skinned people as more useless than monkeys.&nbsp;</span><span style>Russia was beaten by Grid and Alexander pushed all responsibilities Kraugel, who didn’t come to save them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel was silent for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alexander’s face crumpled.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because Kraugel grabbed his wrist and his grip was too strong and terrible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How does a yellow skinned person have such power?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel was as feminine as a woman. Alexander couldn’t believe that Kraugel could exert more power than him.&nbsp;</span><span style>With a force that was enough to break the wrist, Kraugel whispered in a desolate voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I was forced to endure it on the opening day, but not anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, Kraugel hadn’t figured out the team’s tendencies at the start of the match.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was forced to give the lead to Alexander, but not anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You aren’t in a position to say anything. I am the dominant one in this relationship.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Flinch!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel’s black eyes were deeper than the abyss.&nbsp;</span><span style>Alexander felt a strange fear because he couldn’t read any emotions in these eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was just a yellow skinned person.&nbsp;</span><span style>Alexander couldn’t admit it and tried to swing his fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This damn monkey hasn’t grasped who you are going against...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did the physical abilities of the real body affect the virtual reality body?&nbsp;</span><span style>The experts’ opinion was ‘no.’&nbsp;</span><span style>The body in virtual reality was completely separate from the physical body.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to move the virtual reality body better, the important factor wasn’t the physical abilities, but the interaction of the brain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this regard, Kraugel thought that ‘experience’ was an important factor.&nbsp;</span><span style>For example, swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style>Swinging a sword 10 times in reality meant it was possible to use a sword in the virtual world without Sword Mastery.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, the ability to use a sword was communicated through commands from the brain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Satisfy was released.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were the days when he didn’t know about his mother’s condition.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel participated in many sports and martial arts with pure passion.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was with the attitude of becoming the supreme person in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A slender body?&nbsp;</span><span style>That was only when wearing clothes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel’s sleek muscles hidden under his clothes were comparable to professional martial artists.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuack...!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel evaded Alexander’s fist and punched his face.&nbsp;</span><span style>The process was as fast as lightning, causing Alexander to fall and see stars.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuuong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel placed his foot on Alexander’s thick neck.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kkuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kek...! Keeek!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alexander felt great pain from his vocal cords being pressed on.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel spoke to the terrified Alexander.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know people like you. You’re a type of gangster who doesn’t obey until you are trampled on. You decided that I couldn’t be targeted in virtual reality, but reality is different. Isn't that right?"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kkuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel placed greater weight onto the foot on Alexander’s neck.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, Alexander’s face turned white.&nbsp;</span><span style>He still couldn’t see any emotions in Kraugel’s eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Alexander realized that Kraugel wasn’t afraid of hurting people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This guy... This guy is the real deal.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could kill a person. A person who absolutely shouldn’t be touched.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alexander shook as Kraugel gave a last warning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you ever mention my mother with that filthy mouth of yours again, I will pull your tongue out. In addition, don’t grab my ankle in the next team event. New medicine? Russia isn’t the only one who has it, so you can’t control me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tang tang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Alexander, who had difficulty breathing, banged his hand several times on the floor in surrender. It was a signal of surrender.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Kraugel didn’t let him off easily.&nbsp;</span><span style>He pressed down on Alexander’s neck, staring down silently for a long amount of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alexander felt dizzy due to lack of oxygen and couldn’t meet Kraugel’s eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>The hierarchical relationship was perfectly established.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel was forced to be an eternal outsider in Russia, where trash like Alexander lived.&nbsp;</span><span style>This personality was revealed during his first meeting with Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>Alexander ran away after Kraugel let him go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel lay down in the capsule with an uneasy expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Russia is the only one who has the new medicine.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy was the largest culture and business in the world, so Kraugel’s value was astronomical. There were countless countries who wanted him to immigrate there.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, none of them had developed a new drug that could treat Alzheimer’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, Kraugel needed to lead Russia to victory.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Scanning your body.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Recognize your iris.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Verifying the user’s information.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The capsule protection system is working.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Log in to Satisfy.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chiiiiing!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel’s eyes slowly cleared. His five senses were sucked into Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then after a while.&nbsp;</span><span style>A capsule in the corner opened.&nbsp;</span><span style>The person who got up was Jishuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kraugel had this story.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had laid down in the capsule before Kraugel and heard a noise before logging in. Then she unintentionally learned Kraugel’s story.&nbsp;</span><span style>This information, she needed to tell Grid and Overgeared. Jishuka rushed over to Shang X Lila Hotel.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"The combination of sweet and salty is very good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It melts in my mouth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shang X Lila Hotel’s restaurant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The South Korean representatives were dining there.&nbsp;</span><span style>The restaurant had three Michelin stars, so the food was excellent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even Peak Sword, who was an enthusiast about Korean food, had to acknowledge this taste.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The cooking skills are great. I want to try the kimchi stew made by the chef of this restaurant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was hard to understand why he would want to eat kimchi stew made by a French chef.&nbsp;</span><span style>In this atmosphere, Grid felt frustrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why is the rate of service so slow when the amount of food is so small? The restaurant owner is incredibly lazy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was a typical modern Korean used to delivery food.&nbsp;</span><span style>The average time was 15 minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the French restaurant took 2~3 hours on average for a course, causing Grid to feel horribly frustrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"In this case, it would be better to just boil ramyun. Michelin is a waste of time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Um... I would like to try the soybean paste stew made by the chef of this restaurant...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The frustrated Grid and Peak Sword who was talking nonsense.&nbsp;</span><span style>The two people made it difficult to relax and enjoy the food.&nbsp;</span><span style>The party thought that they shouldn’t eat with Grid and Peak Sword from the next meal onwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Yura was glad.&nbsp;</span><span style>She felt a strange happiness just sitting at the same table as Grid. If she was with Grid, she could endure eating instant noodles three times a day for the rest of her life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You’re this far from home, how about having a glass of wine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A restaurant where a nice piano melody was flowing.&nbsp;</span><span style>A youth with silver hair approached the raucous South Korean table.&nbsp;</span><span style>His blue eyes was as beautiful and clear as the sky. It was Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite his casual appearance, he looked like a noble as he held out a bottle of red wine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a relatively recent vintage of Romane X.&nbsp;</span><span style>Only 6,000 bottles of wine were produced a year, it was one of the finest limited quality wines.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel had prepared such a precious wine for Grid and was touched by his own loyalty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This body of wine, like the blood that flowed in my body for thousands of years, is lavish and sublime. This red wine is the symbol of me, Lauel... It reflects my will to be in your heart forever.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Korean members paled.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their hands and feet shrivelled up from Lauel’s words.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid, Peak Sword, and Yura were fine.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura had outstanding composure, while Grid and Peak Sword didn’t have good English.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Okay, okay."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know God Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid and Peak Sword responded as they accepted the wine that Lauel brought.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, drinking soju and rice wine was still the best.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was speechless as he watched tens of thousands of dollars disappearing in vain.&nbsp;</span><span style>In this chaotic atmosphere...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Listen to my story!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka ran in and started to tell Kraugel’s story.&nbsp;</span><span style>But there wasn’t a translator so the only people who could understand here were Yura and Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel watched Grid and said to Yura and Jishuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For the moment, keep this a secret from Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel knew that Grid and Kraugel had a great affinity with each other.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Grid knew about Kraugel’s circumstances, he might not be able to fully concentrate on the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will fix this problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He learned how to get Kraugel into Overgeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel smiled with satisfaction and headed to his room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the next day.&nbsp;</span><span style>The 2nd day of the National Competition began.</span></p>
