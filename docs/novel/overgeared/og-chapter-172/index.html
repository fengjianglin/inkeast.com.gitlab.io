 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Talent could be grown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Study, exercise, work.&nbsp;</span><span style>They would be able to reach first place in any field if they tried hard enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it was different in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were many geniuses among the two billion users.&nbsp;</span><span style>If they crossed tens of thousands of mountains, there were still thousands of mountains remaining. After crossing those thousands of mountains, there were dozens of mountains blocking them again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Among the many mountains, the highest mountain was Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was immovable in her 5th place on the unified rankings.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘She truly is a monster.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bubat was a member of the Turkish national team and 25th on the unified rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style>He combined bold judgments and powerful CC to be called Satisfy’s best initiator.&nbsp;</span><span style>The battlefield was always favorable to his allies when he was fighting in the lead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that didn’t work in front of Yura.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>'Damn, it’s perfect timing without any errors. Is she a human? She isn’t a computer?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rare hidden class, Crusher.&nbsp;</span><span style>Just like its name, the Crusher class was designed to shatter formations.&nbsp;</span><span style>He used the ‘Unconditional’ skill to rush within 3m of the target and used CC combos to instantly destroy the enemy.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Yura’s calm and clever responses made the Crusher’s advantages ineffective.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There is a 0.5 second gap between approaching and the CC combo. She properly counters at the right timing, making my posture collapse and my techniques not work properly.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t even a 1-on-1 situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura alone was dealing with 15 people.&nbsp;</span><span style>She perfectly poured out magic towards 14 people while keeping the CC in check.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If this is the 5th place, then what are the freaks above her?’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwang!</span></i> <i><span style>Kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crazy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was attack called the best defense?&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura still hadn’t used defense magic once.&nbsp;</span><span style>She used curse magic to neutralize the tankers and damage dealers, then attacked them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her ability to suppress the enemy attacks by just attacking was overwhelming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Too strong. Isn’t this at the level of a boss monster?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Unless we use CC on her, this will turn into a war of attrition. We need to create the perfect opportunity for Bubat.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The defenders did their best to expose a loophole in Yura. Due to their resistance to magic, the curse magic wasn’t perfect, but they still suffered some damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>Therefore, this wasn’t an easy task.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura’s strength wasn’t her curse magic or powerful attack spells. It was her analysis, prediction and choices.&nbsp;</span><span style>She analyzed the enemy’s behavioral patterns and predicted how to deal with their attacks. Then she used magic that was difficult to deal with.&nbsp;</span><span style>She forced two or three choices on their opponent, making them feel confused about what would be their best action.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>『 This is truly amazing...! This is the dignity of the 5th ranked user! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The experts from all over the world, including the commentator. In addition, the spectators and viewers were shocked beyond admiration.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because Yura’s power was so unrealistic that she managed to last five minutes against the top rankers representing eight countries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But now she has reached her limit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the moment that Zibal in the US waiting room had been waiting for.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...Uh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura started to allow attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her concentration didn’t drop. It was because her magic power was at its limit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘She is weakened!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The curse magic that restrained the rankers was loosened. Yura’s mana was on the verge of being depleted, so she couldn’t afford to use new curses. Thanks to that, the tankers burst through the magical bombardment with their solid bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the end!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hiyaaack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The swords, spears, axes and shields aimed at Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They were released from the curse magic too early. Their methods of dealing with my magic is also good. They are strong.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura expressed her displeasure and used defense magic for the first time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Diamond Shield.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjeejeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The weakness of the black magicians was that they had less defense spells that other magicians.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura was level 291 and close to her third advancement, but she used a defense magic that she obtained at level 230. Yes, it was the diamond shield that she learned on the day she first met Grid at the Yatan Temple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And the damage that the diamond shield could absorb wasn’t great.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeok!</span></i> <i><span style>Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘Victory!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were convinced after seeing cracks in the shield.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Yura pulled out an orb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Divine Punishment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Divine Punishment]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Summons a lightning bolt that deals 15,000~23,000 damage within 10 metres.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Range of Damage: 3m radius around the target.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dark spells stored in the orb could be used without any casting time.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, the target of the magic wasn’t the tankers. It was the damage dealers in the rear.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwajajajajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Obvious limitations existed for skills with a fixed damage. They weren’t effective against people with high health.&nbsp;</span><span style>Once time passed and the level of the users became higher, this Divine Punishment skill was likely to become obsolete.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it was still useful in the present time.&nbsp;</span><span style>The damage dealers in the mid 200s only had around 15,000 health.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuaaaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She ignored the threat from the tankers and dealt with the damage dealers?&nbsp;</span><span style>The four damage dealers didn’t have time to use defensive or evasive skills as they screamed and turned into grey light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ray!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dammit! Vas was struck!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once their partners were logged out, the angry tankers poured their attack skills onto Yura.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The newly deployed diamond shield was shattered and scratches started to appear on Yura’s white skin.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk!</span></i> <i><span style>Puuok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Her slender body was pierced with sharp iron.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Stagger.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The commentators sighed as the treasure of South Korea was about to collapse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Ahh...! They struggled against Yura’s overwhelming ability, but now she is allowing some attacks...! 』&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 A magician’s defense and health are very low. Once they allow an attack, they will collapse rapidly. This must hurt. Yura was the person most likely to win a medal in the target processing... As many people have predicted, it seems that South Korea won’t be able to make any achievements in the national competition. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Korean audiences were outraged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do it in moderation! Don’t mess up Yura’s pretty face!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You damn bastards! Why are you bothering a girl who is fighting alone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dog-like bastards! I will remember your IDs. Let’s see if we meet in the field later! I will sacrifice my life to get revenge for the goddess!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Crash!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yura allowed an attack and collapsed.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, she fell to one knee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah...!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Serves you right!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Korean audiences gasped while the foreign audiences cheered.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jebeok jebeok.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A young Asian man was admitted to the stadium under the guidance of staff members.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was heading in the direction of the capsule room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? What’s going on?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is that person?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was sudden confusion.&nbsp;</span><span style>The commentator belatedly spread the news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 That person’s ID is Grid. He is a member of the South Korean national team and scheduled to be Yura’s partner in the target processing match. He was unavoidably delayed and arrived late.』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Korean audiences booed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grid? It is the first time I’ve heard that name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah... What is this? This scum that I’ve never heard of has arrived at the last minute? Is this a comedy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That bastard is going to appear now? Yura is suffering because of him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was also backlash from the foreign audience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? How can he participate midway?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It is against the rules!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The commentator explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 According to the organizers, there is no rule that prohibits participating while the event is going on. So it seems that the Korean team member’s belated admission isn’t a problem. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The experts from various international media outlets frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 For a player to participate in the middle of a match... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 I know that the National Competition’s Organizational Committee is made up of Korean government personnel and executives of the S.A. Group. Their lack of professionalism is showing. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 This is the first year the National Competition is held so there are a lot of loopholes. Well, won’t it improve gradually? There is a story that the organizational committee is restructuring with experts. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 ...The bottom line is that the Korean team member is going to participate. How will this change the situation? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 What will change? Yura is already at her limit. The man called ‘Grid’ who is joining late isn’t even on the list of 1,000 top ranker players. The fate of the Korean team won’t change. At this rate, they will be eliminated. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The odds of an unknown player participating in the target processing match filled with only players in the top 80 was close to zero.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s why no one was expecting anything from Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, the players from eight countries surrounding Yura and were trying to deal the final blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Forcing my player to logout...! It’s over for our country now! I will kill you myself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas tried to stop them but it was impossible.&nbsp;</span><span style>Med was suddenly more agile than Faker and persistently pursued him, not allowing Regas to escape.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Med attacked Regas with a club while glaring sharply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You ruined everything. If it wasn’t for you, Yura would’ve been easily managed and we wouldn’t have wasted so much time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at the scoreboard, the US, France, Brazil, China and Japan all exceeded 50 points.&nbsp;</span><span style>South Korea had 78 points, but sooner or later Yura would die. She wasn’t the problem.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the players from other countries were still going strong. It was impossible to cover that 50 point gap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura was attacked by several weapons, while the club aimed at Regas.&nbsp;</span><span style>Regas could break through the crisis on his own.&nbsp;</span><span style>He could give up his flesh and bones.&nbsp;</span><span style>He counterattacked right after being hit by the club.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Yura was helpless.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her mana was depleted and a weapon was just about to stab into her neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yura!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the end of South Korea’s sole hope.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Korean spectators and viewers screamed.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, the foreign audiences cheered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"South Korea should exit here! It’s obvious!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The millions of people watching the competition didn’t doubt that Yura would die.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ah, except for one person.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaeeeeeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Seven golden blades fell from the sky. They accurately deflected the weapons about to hit Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...What?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rankers who were prevented from taking Yura’s life were astonished.&nbsp;</span><span style>Who had interfered?&nbsp;</span><span style>They felt doubt and raised their heads in the direction that the blades came from. The cameras also followed them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blue sky was caught in the relay being sent to the whole world.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was just the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No one?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Surely the blades came from there?</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 What is this? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rankers, commentators and experts. As the spectators and viewers were feeling puzzled...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The villain has appeared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A young man called ‘Grid’ appeared behind the rankers who were staring at the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"When?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an unexpected situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>A man’s voice was heard where there was nothing?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is it a person with Faker level stealth?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If so, the person must be a powerhouse.&nbsp;</span><span style>The rankers felt an eerier sensation and turned around.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it was too late.&nbsp;</span><span style>The dark greatsword was already being swung.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The strongest representatives of each country were taken out with a single blow.&nbsp;</span><span style>The people supporting the eight countries were in great shock.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid knew better than anyone else how shock could turn to despair and warned them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Be fully prepared. You will experience the same thing from now on.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttaak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid snapped his fingers. Then the seven blades protecting Yura flew into the sky and started attacking the targets flying at 40m per second.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The fragments of the exploded targets filled the screen.&nbsp;</span><span style>The stopped score of the Korean team started again, while Grid took off his Hooded Zip Up while the enemies were gazing at the golden blades.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wore brilliant armor that was red, gold and black.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The one-sided game, start.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was this a devil?&nbsp;</span><span style>An arrogant black-haired man in the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>His mouth wasn’t the problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is serious.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They lost four damage dealers to Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now eight of the remaining eleven players from eight countries were unable to move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Waaahhhhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Korean spectators cheered in unison.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was no one who frowned at Grid now.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were thrilled by Grid’s spectacular appearance.</span></p>
