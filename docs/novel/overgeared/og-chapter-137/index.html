 <p><span style>Chapter 137</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Once every four months, two full moons would overlap in one night.&nbsp;</span><span style>When the coastal waters of Brinichi experienced a low tide, a secret path would be revealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I finally found it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bottom of the sea showed a glittering path.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Splash splash.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A girl moved along the path, not caring about how wet her shoes and clothes got.&nbsp;</span><span style>The mysterious and calm purple path continued into the depths of the sea.&nbsp;</span><span style>The girl hesitated for a moment as she gazed into the depths, before taking a deep breath. Then she started to play the flute she had prepared in advance.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Beep.</span></i> <i><span style>Bibiririr.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The melody spread over the calm waves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The image of the girl playing a flute alone in the moonlight was as beautiful as a picture.&nbsp;</span><span style>A notification window appeared in the girl’s vision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have played Laurelia’s Flute. You can breathe underwater for 25 minutes.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kkoruruk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The girl gathered up her courage and dove in. She was greeted with the magnificent sea creatures as she swam along the lit up path and reached the secret kingdom at the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You are the first discoverer of the Siren Kingdom!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[It is a place passed down in legends. If you create and sell a map of this place, you can earn great reputation and gold.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[If you sell the map first to the 3rd Prince of the Saharan Empire, a quest will be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will leave the map making to a later time...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In any area, the first discoverer would receive great benefits. But was it so easy to be the first discoverer among two billion users?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an inspiring sight, but the girl’s interest lay elsewhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The purpose of her arrival here was to acquire the method of making the orb that Braham’s first disciple, Mumud used during his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I need to find the production method quickly and bring it to Grid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl’s ID was Euphemina.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past, she had asked Grid to produce an orb in exchange for saving Grid from Winston’s dungeon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had promised to do it, as long as she obtained the orb’s production method and materials.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina had searched for what was the best orb in history.&nbsp;</span><span style>She came to the conclusion that Braham’s orb was by far the best, but the conditions of use were too high. Therefore, she searched for the orb used by his disciple, Mumud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The end of her journey led to the Siren Kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style>500 years ago, he had married and settled here.&nbsp;</span><span style>Euphemina needed to find Mumud’s descendant and acquire the production method for his orb.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t long now... Grid, I’ll come find you soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wanted to meet him quickly.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t just anticipation for the orb Grid would make.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>She was one of the three revealed epic classes in Satisfy, yet he had made her feel tremendous helplessness. Therefore, she wondered how far he had grown now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t have any ulterior motives. It's just pure curiosity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She blushed while talking to herself, and the inhabitants of the Siren Kingdom thought that humans were strange creatures.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Heok!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was still dark early in the morning.&nbsp;</span><span style>Shin Youngwoo, who fell asleep watching TV the night before, woke up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have a bad feeling...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Somehow, there was a chill down his spine.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t remember it, but he seemed to have a nightmare.&nbsp;</span><span style>He took off his coat that was wet with sweat and rose from his seat. Then he headed straight to the bathroom and turned on the shower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He normally only washed once every three days, so why did he shower as soon as he woke up? It was comparable to the sun rising in the west!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s my first night, so shouldn’t I wash and cleanse before it? Huhuhut...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shin Youngwoo couldn’t suppress his smile.&nbsp;</span><span style>He hummed as he washed up, then headed straight to the capsule. Before connecting to Satisfy, he opened up the Internet.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tatak!</span></i> <i><span style>Tatatang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As if it was expressing his excited mind, the sound of tapping on the keyboard was light.&nbsp;</span><span style>After a while, the search results for ‘sex in Satisfy’ appeared before Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were hundreds of thousands of articles.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo was thrilled while reading.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh...! It is possible for NPCs as well as users!! Huh? What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy was like another reality, so sex was naturally included.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the S.A. Group put limitations on it because of a fear that users would become irresponsible if there were no restrictions, and in the worst case scenario, it could be abused for criminal acts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...In Satisfy, sex could only happen when formally married, and the number of times is limited to once a month... If these conditions aren’t met, sexual functions are impossible...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo was silent while reading the conditions.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then there was a bang from the keyboard! He had struck downwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dammit! Only once a month?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Something he saved... No, he was finally going to get rid of the virgin status that he had been keeping for no reason!&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo planned to share his love with Irene day and night, so he was frustrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Only once a month...! I want to do it, but it’s only once a month! Dammit! Who would be satisfied with that much...? Of course, not me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo was lying on the ground like a child, but then he suddenly regained his calm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘So what if it is once a month? I’ve never once experienced it in 27 years so once a month... It is amazing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maybe because it was early.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo recovered from the frustration and returned to the capsule.&nbsp;</span><span style>After searching the Internet, he got a recommendation for a best-selling book called ‘100 Techniques to Satisfy Women’ and immediately purchased it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh...! Ohhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a book that described scenes that Youngwoo had never actually experienced in detail, from an expert point of view.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo read the amazing and sacred book more intensively than any tutorial lectures.&nbsp;</span><span style>How much time passed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...It’s a new world.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the first time that he enjoyed the act of reading. Time passed by without him knowing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The sun was completely up outside his window. He checked the clock and saw that it was 11 a.m.&nbsp;</span><span style>His parents were at work and Sehee at school, so he was alone in the house.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo headed into the kitchen. He ate food to restore his stamina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keeeok~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The feeling of satiation was great.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he took a bath and built up his knowledge.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>'All the preparations are perfect!’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo returned to the capsule and logged into Satisfy with a confident look. But as he tried to log in, he suddenly got up and headed to the bathroom again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This time it will be perfect!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The confident Youngwoo entered the capsule and logged in.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Buzz buzz.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Khan’s smithy was the hideout of the Tzedakah Guild. Most of the guild members were already there, and their attention focused on Grid as soon as he logged in.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Vantner called out his name and made a fuss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey Grid! What is this? What did you do to end up marrying Lady Irene?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two days ago in Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid left for a quest and finally returned to Winston after 40 days.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner had been waiting for Grid more than anyone else, so he was ecstatic when Grid returned.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then an unexpected and shocking scene occurred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Irene, who was close to Vantner’s ideal type, rushed into Grid’s arms?&nbsp;</span><span style>After that, she made a shocking announcement at Grid’s return celebration party at the castle.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was that she was going to marry Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aaaaack! Why? Why you? Why am I not you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since staying in Winston, Vantner had worked tirelessly to acquire the favor of Lady Irene. It was common for love to bloom between a user and NPC, so he had a positive outlook.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Irene was the only heir to Earl Steim, making her like a flower on a cliff.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even Vantner, who was a ranker, didn’t have a chance to meet with her. He couldn’t even get quests related to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you... How did you get so close to her? How did you captivate her heart? You have a lower level and are uglier than me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner was filled with sadness, jealousy, anger and all types of bad emotions. Then he lost his temper as Pon spoke to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, it is too much to say that he is uglier than you. Bald person...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shut up! I already told you that I’m not bald in reality, you bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, it’s true that you told me a hundred times that you aren’t bald in reality, but aren’t you bald here? And think about the age gap. Don’t you know that Lady Irene looks like a girl if you stand next to her? No, what type of guy goes after a young girl like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-What? Why does age matter in love? &nbsp;Don’t ruin my pure love!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What? Do you want to be hit? Would you like a taste of my Gale Spear?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Try it! Let’s both die today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two people were arguing again today.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to that, Grid could free himself from Vantner. He approached Jishuka and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is everyone doing here? Why are you gathered?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re asking why? It’s to attend your wedding as guests. You are getting married in Satisfy. It is also the first time we are seeing a user marry an NPC, so the expectations are big.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hrmm... Aren’t you busy ruling Bairan Village? Is it possible for a lord to leave their place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It would be impossible to play if being the lord is so busy that I can’t even leave for a day or two. There is time to spare. I also left Toban in charge in case of emergencies. By the way Grid, you seem to have changed a lot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Changed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, originally you would’ve cursed back at Vantner. But you just let it go in one ear and out the other... I think your personality has matured.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m already in my late 20’s. I’m originally an adult.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He answered casually, but he was also surprised to find himself changed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Whenever he connected to Satisfy, his mind became calm and relaxed, unlike in reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the effect of his higher insight stat.&nbsp;</span><span style>Currently, Grid’s 600 points in insight wasn’t enough to contemplate the world, but it could see through it to some extent.&nbsp;</span><span style>So when he dealt with someone or faced an unexpected situation, he could make a reflexive judgment on how to act and calmed down accordingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where is Faker?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had obtained three items after defeating the assassins on the way to the Vatican.&nbsp;</span><span style>One of the was Kenen’s Dart Belt, while the other two were traps and poison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The belt was classified as equipment and could naturally be used, but trap installation tools and poison combination machines were classified as items made by experts in their field, not equipment. It was impossible to use even for Pagma’s Descendant, and he had to learn how to use them separately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want Faker to teach me how to use an item...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka shrugged at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe he’s here, but I’m not sure. He’s very skilled at hiding.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faker, the number one assassin, was a master of stealth. Even if he didn’t use a skill, he could erase his presence by controlling his stride and breathing.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past, he had become angry after being caught by Euphemina, who had high insight.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Grid had more insight than Euphemina at that time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Over there.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid found Faker standing with his arms crossed in a corner of the smithy and approached.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Faker, can you teach me how to install traps and use this poison machine? I picked up these items by chance and they look pretty useful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faker’s eyes widened with surprise.&nbsp;</span><span style>The people next to him couldn’t even see him, so he was surprised to find that Grid had left the center of people and had discovered him.&nbsp;</span><span style>He looked into Grid’s deep eyes and confirmed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He has grown.’</span></p>
