 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro was a legendary farmer?&nbsp;</span><span style>How absurd. No, this was almost the level of paranoia. It was a development that wouldn’t be found even in third-rate web novels all over the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Piaro dreamed of being a sword saint, so why would he be a farmer?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason that Piaro increased the chances of a good harvest was...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He probably learned a technique while farming as a hobby.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a reasonable guess.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro was a very versatile person, so it wasn’t impossible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I just had an absurd delusion.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was afraid that Jude was laughing at him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid smiled before regaining his calm. Then he looked at Piaro and Asmophel.&nbsp;</span><span style>They needed time alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s leave here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid said and the Overgeared members followed him. Damian was with them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro and Asmophel started to have a long conversation once they were left alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On this day, both of them vowed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Duke Grid who relieved their misunderstanding and helped them see the true object of their revenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>They pledged eternal loyalty to the one who saved them from hell.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The road to the castle.&nbsp;</span><span style>The stunning landscape of the significantly developed Reidan captured Grid’s attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s definitely more than the old Reidan now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it was far less than Winston.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The size was more than twice the sum of those two cities, but the overall facilities were less.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The problem was that the population was small from the beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The best administrator, Rabbit, was active, but the speed of development was slow because there was no manpower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lauel, are there plans to deal with the population crisis?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"As you did before, we plan to secure and migrate the minorities that are being persecuted everywhere in the empire.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like the case with the Ul Clan.&nbsp;</span><span style>But there was a clear limit to this method.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members would suffer too much. In addition, it was unlikely that the empire would keep allowing it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there a natural way to increase the population?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t know it yet, but Reidan became famous thanks to the invasion of the seven guilds.&nbsp;</span><span style>Many people were showing interest in Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel was sure that at this moment, many users would be trying to move to Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the problem was that the barrier of entry was too high.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was unknown how many of them would reach Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You shouldn’t think too hastily. First, complete the mine development and connect the roads. Then the deployment of troops will be easier and the number of monsters will gradually decrease... We can only wait until then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is the speed of progress for the mine development?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There aren’t enough skilled workers. In particular, securing miners is difficult. It seems like it will take more time than planned.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miners...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be ideal if Minor acted as a miner, but the search for pavranium came first.&nbsp;</span><span style>Right now, it was too early to stick Minor in the mines.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I shouldn’t worry too much. By the way, why hasn’t there been news from Minor?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Minor was on a mission to find all the labyrinths in the west.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was worried that he had run across monsters and was in a crisis.&nbsp;</span><span style>No, that clever boy wouldn’t be caught so easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I shouldn’t worry.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid changed topics.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Then Lauel, do other guilds already have a knights division?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Knights division? I don’t think there would be a lot? If the guild creates a specific organization and call it a knights division, then it will become a knights division. Well, it’s easy to mass produce.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed he didn’t know there was a separate system called a knights division.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Then I am the first master of a true knights division?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was probably the case.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t easy to obtain named NPCs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The first knights division...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Satisfy, the meaning of ‘first’ was very big.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an achievement that would often give special benefits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What benefits will I receive?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s heart started to become restless again. But this wasn’t a problem.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to prevent the suffering and frustration that he felt in the past, he always maintained the proper tension.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m glad you have returned safely."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duke Grid! Welcome!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entrance of the castle.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was greeted by Administrator Rabbit and Jude, who had been informed of his arrival in advance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid observed them with the Great Lord's Sword and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They have also developed.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit had gained a lot of intelligence and political power, while Jude had gained a lot of strength and stamina.&nbsp;</span><span style>It showed how faithfully they had taken on their roles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You went through many hardships while I was gone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid patted their shoulders.&nbsp;</span><span style>Administrator Rabbit bowed humbly, while the pleased Jude snorted like a bull.&nbsp;</span><span style>They accompanied Grid into the castle.&nbsp;</span><span style>The 1,000 nervous soldiers saluted in unison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kingdom's hero! Reidan’s sun! We greet the great Duke Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Attention!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shouts shook the castle.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid observed them as he walked past.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They aren’t inferior when compared with the empire’s soldiers.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a tremendous growth rate.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was evidence that Jude’s ignorant training method was having a great effect.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the power of the ‘I have no Idea (SS)’ skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had no thoughts. Jude’s ability to raise the soldiers made Grid smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eyes of a man closely watching him shone.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is the time!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Grid arrived in Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian had been waiting for the right timing to say hello and he finally grabbed the chance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid seemed to be in a good mood right now!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid! It has been a long time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian went forward and greeted him.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was nervous, but tried not to show it to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He went down on one knee and bowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid asked,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok.”&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an unexpected response.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Y-You don’t remember me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian felt like crying.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid looked at the disappointed person in front of him.&nbsp;</span><span style>From Grid’s standpoint, Damian was nothing more than an extra in the pope raid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was also a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian reminded himself of this and formally introduced himself.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I am Damian, a paladin of the Rebecca Church and the Goddess' Agent. Around one year and two months ago in Satisfy time, I buffed Grid while you raided Pope Drevigo.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now Grid remembered Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style>The otaku paladin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He hadn’t known it at the time, but looking back now, Damian’s buffing ability was remarkable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I remember. Then why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did he perhaps want to join the Overgeared Guild?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was filled with big expectations when Damian suddenly cried out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please save Isabel-chan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isabel?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who was that again?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Ah, I remember.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>One of Rebecca’s Daughters. She had blonde hair and used an exceptional spear.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘Did something happen to her?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, why was this person asking for help from Grid?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Ah right.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A chill went down Grid’s spine.&nbsp;</span><span style>He remembered what he did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Lifael’s Spear.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a special weapon for Rebecca’s Daughters that Pagma had sealed.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had released the seal.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he neglected to return.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Dammit.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel was dying because of him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid became uncomfortable as he identified the situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>He felt guilty about putting someone’s life at risk, and he was also worried that Damian would claim compensation for the damages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have no money.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian begged the nervous Grid again.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I will give you all my assets! So please... Please save Isabel-chan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid through Damian would claim compensation for damages, but he was actually rewarding Grid? And it was money?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A pushover?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that time, Lauel sent a whisper to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Damian is a pope candidate.</span></i> <i><span style>How about helping him?</span></i> <i><span style>If he becomes a pope, Reidan will be able to form a friendship with the mighty forces of the Rebecca Church.</span></i> <i><span style>The profit from it can’t be converted into money.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘Pope candidate...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, Grid intended to help Damian from the beginning.&nbsp;</span><span style>More than anything else, he felt sorry towards Isabel. In addition...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Lifael’s Spear.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A divine item.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a great opportunity to observe it in detail.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Finally.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be possible to create divine items.&nbsp;</span><span style>A weapon above Failure. No, maybe an item that exceeded Pagma’s works would be born.&nbsp;</span><span style>A smile appeared on Grid’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian panicked at Grid’s sudden question.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid explained to the bewildered Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style>“How much will you give me in return for sealing Lifael’s Spear? How much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had to take everything he could.&nbsp;</span><span style>This wasn’t a shameless greed. It was foolish to miss the opportunity to obtain something, unless he was a pushover.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have already been a pushover in the past.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian said carefully,&nbsp;</span><span style>"I have currently prepared 530,000 gold...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the amount he prepared as a deposit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hrmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>How much was that in Korean money?</span></p>
 <p><span style>'636 million won...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid calculated it in his head.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian felt anxious when Grid showed no reaction and hurriedly said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I-If I dispose of my mansion, I can get an additional 1.2 million gold!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mansion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes! It is a small mansion where I live in Tokyo, Japan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He will sell his house in reality just for an NPC?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, Grid would’ve laughed at Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style>But not anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style>Irene, Khan, Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid experienced the love of NPCs so he felt more affinity towards Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He isn’t a bad person.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was a pushover.&nbsp;</span><span style>That wasn’t all.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian was a pope candidate. The possibility that Damian could become a pope should be kept in mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to think about future relationship rather than be greedy for money now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he did this favor for Damian, it would be a great help to Grid in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will accept just 530,000 gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian was well aware of what a greedy person Grid was.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was completely determined to save Isabel-chan and had been expecting to spend a huge amount of money.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was even prepared to sell his organs if he had to.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it was a misunderstanding. Grid wasn’t that evil. Rather, he was a generous person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you! I really appreciate it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was willing to help him!&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian was so thrilled that he started crying.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid, who was willing to spare Isabel-chan from suffering pain, looked like an angel to Damian in this moment.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Grid was excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is an opportunity to observe a divine weapon.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt like he found a bundle of money on the way to picking up his lottery winnings.</span></p>
