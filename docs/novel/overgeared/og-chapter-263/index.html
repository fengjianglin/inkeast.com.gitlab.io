 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s the first time that we’ve met in reality.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo returned home after jogging with Sehee.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo encountered a man in his mid-30’s in a nice suit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Peak Sword?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gave off a stronger feeling in the game, but it was definitely Peak Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was a South Korean who always asked foreigners ‘Do you know?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha! It’s an honor that God Grid recognized me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It isn’t unusual.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, Youngwoo had a close relationship with Peak Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>A friendship formed after they raided Hell Gao in Cork Island Dungeon together, as well as the Sakura Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo didn’t feel uncomfortable despite Peak Sword visiting without any notice. Rather, there was a pleasant feeling. But he was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard you’re usually jogging around this time, so I came to find you in the morning. I was afraid that I wouldn’t be able to meet you, but luckily, I got the timing right.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword extended a card.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Korean Patriotic Association]</span></p>
 <p><span style>President Kang Daehan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kang Daehan.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Peak Sword’s real name.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Korean Patriotic Association? What is that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Our task is to spread South Korea to the world. For example, if we encounter a foreigner...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I understand."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t want to hear a more detailed explanation.&nbsp;</span><span style>He could guess it was something absurd just from the description.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For reference, my sibling’s name is Minguk.” (TL: South Korea pronounced in Korean is Daehan Minguk.)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Daehan and Minguk.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was clear that Peak Sword’s unique patriotism came from his parents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a cool name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Right? But my sibling hates the name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s a girl.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A girl is called Kang Minguk?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...I would hate it as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, I am the same. But she can’t change her name. If the name of Minguk disappears, the meaning of my name won’t be shown. In the first place, does it make sense to change the names our parents give us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why are we having such a pointless conversation?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was dragged into Peak Sword’s pace. Peak Sword seemed to have a lot of talent as an insurance salesman.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo raised his awareness and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you come to find me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That...”&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword was about to explain when he suddenly saw Sehee.&nbsp;</span><span style>He greeted Sehee with a heavy 90 degree bow.&nbsp;</span><span style>“It is an honor to meet God Grid’s sister and Saintess Ruby. This brother and sister are truly the treasure of South Korea.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee turned red. She was embarrassed by the excessive formality and praise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oppa, I will enter first. Talk to each other.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hurried into the house while Peak Sword looked after her with a warm expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She is pretty and polite. My sister Minguk is also pretty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Well, won’t do we go drink coffee and have a talk?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo was thirsty after jogging so he nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two men found a nearby cafe.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The end of June.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to the university students who had already finished their final exams, the Tomorrow Cafe had a few empty seats.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Rattle.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Welcome."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The employee said as the door opened.&nbsp;</span><span style>Some of the guests reflexively gazed towards the entrance and were shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Peak Sword?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, it really is Peak Sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword, the other South Korean ranker apart from Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was a top star of Korea.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Snap snap!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>People started taking photos of Peak Sword with their phones.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Rattle.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Another guest entered the cafe after Peak Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“G-God Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow! Grid! We live in the same neighborhood, but this is the first time I’ve seen him in real life!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kyaaak! Youngwoo-ssi is so cool!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is Noe doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The attention of the people instantly concentrated on Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo was the trend right now.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was enough to make Peak Sword seem like a third-rate celebrity.&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword watched Youngwoo proudly before giving his order to the employee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cappu...chino.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His voice was shaking. He appeared to be sad.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo ignored the people and ordered a banana shake.&nbsp;</span><span style>The two people were seated at a table in the corner.&nbsp;</span><span style>Finally, Peak Sword cut to the chase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to merge the Silver Knights Guild into the Overgeared Guild.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We want to become members of Overgeared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scale of the Silver Knights Guild was huge.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were more than 200 guild members and they were the owners of Cork Island, famous for their gold mines and sightseeing spots, so they were well funded.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was enough to put their name on the list of top 50 guilds.&nbsp;</span><span style>This great guild wanted to be merged into Overgeared. It didn’t make sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo questioned it.&nbsp;</span><span style>“The Silver Knights Guild is enjoying great glory, so why you you want to enter the Overgeared Guild?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword replied honestly.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Our guild’s growth is up to here. There is nobody in the guild with a unique talent, and Cork Island has a geographical limit as an island. It’s difficult to expand our forces, and we will eventually be left behind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then they would be culled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In addition, I want to add strength to the team that you are leading, the pride of South Korea. I want to build the strongest guild together and raise the status of South Korea.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword never dreamed that Youngwoo would refuse the offer. Who would refuse the chance to devour a huge guild?&nbsp;</span><span style>But Youngwoo showed a surprisingly cold reaction.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reason was simple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You seem to have misunderstood something. I didn’t establish Overgeared for my country. The only reason I made Overgeared is so that my colleagues and I can earn money and live better.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo was completely different from Peak Sword. He had an entirely different nature.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Increasing South Korea’s status? Don’t even dream of joining my guild if it is for such a reason. The Overgeared members and I don’t care about that. Don’t you know that Overgeared is a multinational guild?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Honestly, it was a waste. Youngwoo wanted to close his eyes and swallow up the Silver Knights Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, if he allowed them to join while still thinking this foolishness, it could cause a crack in his guild in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had now broadened his view.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was one of the virtues infused in him by Lauel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Above all, I like this guy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he had no affection for Peak Sword, he might’ve merged the guild without hesitation. Then once he took full advantage, he would’ve discarded them.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was also the specialty of Lauel and Rabbit.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Youngwoo liked Peak Sword. He didn’t want their relationship to be broken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword was embarrassed after reading this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you for speaking honestly. My thoughts were too selfish.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m thankful that you understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A waitress brought over the drinks they ordered.&nbsp;</span><span style>She brought the drinks directly because she wanted to see Youngwoo close up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He is okay.’&nbsp;</span><span style>He had sharp eyes and an impressive physique.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was hard to call him handsome at first sight, but he became more charming the more she looked.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘He is constructing a 10 billion won building?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her life would be easy if she caught this man.&nbsp;</span><span style>These were the thoughts revolving around the waitress’ head.&nbsp;</span><span style>She tried to get his attention, but Youngwoo wasn’t interested.&nbsp;</span><span style>His lack of experience with popularity was the cause.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo couldn’t grasp the meaning of the gaze that the female sent him.&nbsp;</span><span style>It might’ve been different if the employee had a D cup.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo drank his banana shake.&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword waited for the waitress to withdraw before speaking again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I still want to merge the Silver Knights Guild into the Overgeared Guild.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What?&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo frowned as Peak Sword repeated his words.&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword bowed his head.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I am also a ranker. I want a better environment. I want to belong to the best guild and play in a better environment. It is the same for everyone else in the Silver Knights Guild.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Overgeared Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>The synergy between the legendary blacksmith and top talents was sure to explode, resulting in the strongest force in the future.&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword’s personal greed made him want to join.&nbsp;</span><span style>This decision was solidified after he actually met Youngwoo. &nbsp;From his point of view, Youngwoo was a good person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“More than anything, I want to be with you. I still can’t forget that Hell Gao raid. It was the most enjoyable day of my gaming life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hrmm."&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo remembered the swordsman who mined the fire stones and gave a strange smile.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Are you mining these days?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the Hell Gao raid, Peak Sword awakened to the fun of mining.&nbsp;</span><span style>He felt an addictive pleasure every time he obtained a fire stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I often enjoy it. When hunting in the dungeon, I will mine while waiting for my health to recover. It’s much better than just sitting down and resting. I have fun, earn money, and my stats go up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What’s the level of your mining skill?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beginner level 9. I will master the beginner level soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo thought Peak Sword had some talent when watching him mine the fire stones, but his growth was faster than expected. It would be good to get more miners.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t there a lot of mines on Cork Island? Miners as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course. Most of the residents of Cork Island are in the mining business. In addition, there are a few miners in the guild.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo’s smile widened further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay. I will accept the Silver Knights Guild.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword’s pleasure couldn’t be described.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo added a condition.&nbsp;</span><span style>"However, you must promise not to force the other guild members to love South Korea.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo was also Korean. It was a rotten country in many ways, but he still loved South Korea.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, he didn’t want to force the guild members to feel the same way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword agreed.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With this, it was finished.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo finished the banana shake and rose from his seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let’s go. I need to connect to Satisfy and share this guild merger with Lauel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword cried out jubilantly.&nbsp;</span><span style>Did he abandon his patriotism to join Overgeared?&nbsp;</span><span style>No. Not at all.&nbsp;</span><span style>He knew.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even if he didn’t taken any actions for South Korea, as long as Koreans belonged to the Overgeared Guild, the status of South Korea would naturally increase.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were many benefits to joining Overgeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo left the cafe with Peak Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword called out to a foreign couple passing by. He pointed to Youngwoo and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo was embarrassed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword was paying attention to his actions, but there seemed to be a limit. He was worried that the Overgeared members wouldn’t be able to adapt for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Well, those parts will be handled by Lauel.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was fortunate that he had Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo said goodbye to Peak Sword and went home. Then he entered his capsule.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Login."</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a mountain of work to do.&nbsp;</span><span style>After accepting Piaro and Asmophel, he had to create a knights division. After that, he had to observe and seal Lifael’s Spear, acquire the design for a myth rated item, and save Isabel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I also need to make more of the Grid set.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo’s vision darkened as he planned many things.</span></p>
