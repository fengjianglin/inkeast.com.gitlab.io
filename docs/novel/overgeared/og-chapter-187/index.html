 <p></p>
 <p><span style> "The time for revenge has come.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The assassins Shay, Kerb and Sniffer.&nbsp;</span><span style>The three people tried to hunt Grid without knowing his identity, but it was frustrating that they lost their items.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their grudge against Grid was quite deep.&nbsp;</span><span style>They felt angry whenever they thought about the value of the dropped items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We must assassinate him and make him drop his items.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three people finally came to Winston after leaving Rolling.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were eyeing the enormous items that Grid used in the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, they wanted the blue greatsword and golden blades.&nbsp;</span><span style>If the assassination was successful, they would be able to get a jackpot from his items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Our stealth is now at level 6...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>'... If we can approach Grid, we can successfully assassinate him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shay was ranked 3rd, Kerb ranked 7th, and Sniffer ranked 9th.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their rankings had risen compared to before.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, they had a third advancement assassin NPC on their side.&nbsp;</span><span style>After completing an S-grade quest for the Assassins Association, they could hire the best assassin for an expensive price.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They could assassinate Grid if they had the power of this assassin.&nbsp;</span><span style>At least, they thought so.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>

 <p><span style>Skill Mana Cost: 30</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: 20 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first epic hidden class, Euphemina.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, she was superior.&nbsp;</span><span style>If she invested a few days into duplicating dozens of skills, she could be called the strongest.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was the one who defeated the 1st ranked assassin, Faker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Once the lord changed, it really developed a lot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She entered Winston quietly.&nbsp;</span><span style>It had been already half a year in reality since she came to Winston to participate in the item production game with Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>She felt refreshed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s completely like heaven compared to when the villainous lord ruled.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Winston was large half a year ago. The population was large and it was economically developed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Nevertheless, the faces of the NPC residents were always dark.&nbsp;</span><span style>The lord was selfish and always neglected the interests of the people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now the people’s faces were full of energy. There were many facilities to take care of them.&nbsp;</span><span style>The new ruler was certainly worthy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘By the way... Where is Khan’s smithy again?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina was amazed as she saw the bustling streets and tried to remember the way.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Winston had changed too much, so it wasn’t easy to find the way. She had to spend quite a lot of time looking for Khan’s smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Show me a level 150 longsword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Are these the only helmets?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wow, this plate armor is amazing! How much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at this greatsword... Amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Euphemina was surprised as she arrived at Khan’s smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Oh my god, why are there so many people?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The smithy was bustling with guests. No, it wasn’t enough to call it bustling.&nbsp;</span><span style>The queue of customers was at least 100m long.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the aftermath of the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>After Grid revealed his identity in the National Competition, many people frequently visited Khan’s smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They went looking for Khan’s smithy in the hope of purchasing items made by Grid, but they became fascinated by Khan’s items.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was natural.&nbsp;</span><span style>Khan’s blacksmithing skill rose by five levels thanks to Blacksmith’s Affection, and it was now advanced level 7.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A blacksmith of the same level didn’t exist on the entire continent. Therefore, word of mouth spread about the outstanding performance of his items and visitors from other countries also came.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Uhh, there is no end to the procession of customers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan hired four workers, but the smithy was non stop busy.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a lot of money to pass onto Grid, but his old age meant that he had limited stamina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sigh... Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan was making items without stopping in order to catch up with orders, only to find a familiar girl among the customers.&nbsp;</span><span style>Color returned to his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh! Isn’t it Euphemina? It’s been a long time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan liked Euphemina a lot.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was the one who helped saved Grid, who had been locked in prison after the item production game.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It has been a long time Khan. You look younger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha! I stopped drinking thanks to Grid and was rejuvenated. You are more beautiful than before. Have you been well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina didn’t dislike it.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Uhh, don’t be ridiculous. Anyway, I have been travelling the continent in order to find the best orb production method.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huhu, and did you find it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan looked expectant as Euphemina pulled out an old scroll.&nbsp;</span><span style>Khan’s eyes widened with surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is truly a great orb... Even the word ‘best’ is attached to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a tremendous orb that he couldn’t produce with his skill. It was doubtful that even his grandfather could produce it, despite being a craftsman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But if it’s Grid...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t it amazing? You’re truly a determined woman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina spoke to the admiring Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Where is Grid? Is he in the middle of making items?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grid isn’t here. There will be an uproar if he showed up here. He already hasn’t been here for a few days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Right. Now that Grid is a huge celebrity, his actions will be limited. So where should I go to meet him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Um...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan didn’t answer right away. He was reluctant to reveal Grid’s whereabouts, even if the other person was Euphemina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'In the first place, Grid doesn’t like Euphemina...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina nodded with understanding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s difficult. Well, it can’t be helped if there’s a problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, Euphemina planned to visit Grid without contacting him beforehand. Now she was forced to send him a whisper in order to find his location.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Grid.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina’s whisper reached Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Winston Castle.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was discussing future policies with Huroi and Lauel when he suddenly shuddered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi cried out with fright.&nbsp;</span><span style>“My Lord! What is going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was there an assassin?&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi was about to draw his sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What it it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel also panicked. He was quite surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s complexion was pale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He was even sweating, so his condition wasn’t right.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the first time Lauel saw Grid like this.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Grid he knew was always dignified and had no fear of the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But what was this situation?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was acting like a frightened rodent in front of the cat?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘To make Grid shake to this extent... What on earth happened?’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gulp.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Was a disaster coming?&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel nervously gulped as Grid opened his mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style>"...Euphemina sent me a whisper. That girl, she is currently in Winston.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Euphemina?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an unfamiliar name to Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Huroi was glad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Euphemina is here? Ohh, isn’t it a reunion after a long time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From Huroi’s perspective, Euphemina was another savior.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>She rescued Grid in the prison, meaning Grid was able to save Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did she come here now? I want to meet her... Um? Hum hum.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi was excited about the idea of reuniting with Euphemina, when he suddenly fell silent.&nbsp;</span><span style>He stared at Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Isn’t Euphemina good? Why don’t you accept her as your subordinate?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was reluctant to meet Euphemina.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi belatedly noticed this fact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is the relationship between My Lord and Euphemina not as favorable as I thought?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel asked,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Who is Euphemina?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid gave a clear description.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She is a terrible person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duplicator.&nbsp;</span><span style>Euphemina was able to duplicate top-grade spells and instantly use them without casting.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t know about the disadvantages so from his point of view, she was the most OP person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She has one of the three epic classes. I promised her that I would make her an item, but I’m worried about what she will do if I make an item below the unique rating.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agnus and Katz were the only ones known to have an epic class.&nbsp;</span><span style>The first epic class was completely hidden. No one knew their identity.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it turned out that Grid was acquainted with the first epic class.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel was filled with admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'He is big.’&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel was very interested.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘If Grid could bring an epic class to his side...'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel’s eyes shone as Grid ordered Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go to Khan’s smithy. Then bring Euphemina to the castle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi politely answered and left the castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Winston Street.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Huroi moved alone, a group was secretly following him.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Shay’s group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“According to the information collected, that guy is Grid’s aide.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He is 900th on the unified rankings.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"His class isn’t anything special either. An orator?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"According to our source, he’s the embarrassing type of person who always bows down to Grid. Considering his class, he will be weaker than we think.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill him. Won’t Grid be angry if we kill that guy? I want to see him shaking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, let’s kill him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shay’s party had fairly decent intelligence.&nbsp;</span><span style>They looked at Huroi and made fun of him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>A deserted alleyway.&nbsp;</span><span style>Three assassins appeared behind Huroi, who was heading to Khan’s smithy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...You are?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi asked calmly and Sniffer smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We are the ones who will kill you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shay remarked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The villains have appeared. I guess?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Villains?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time he appeared in public since Grid participated in the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Someone dares touch My Lord... Aren’t your mothers ashamed of giving birth to people like you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why was he suddenly talking about their parents?&nbsp;</span><span style>What was this wicked guy?&nbsp;</span><span style>Then a notification window flashed in front of Shay.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have been overwhelmed by the spiteful tongue. Defense and attack power will decrease by 30%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this gap, Huroi pulled out his sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a one-handed sword that seemed to be a compact version of Dainsleif.</span></p>
