 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Is there a reason you didn’t use your ranged skill called Transcended Link? Isn’t it a skill optimized to catch Hurent when he’s running away?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Yura’s question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were heading back to the waiting room after the awards ceremony.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo was humming happily. No one would’ve believed that he had been angry during the awards ceremony.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The target processing match, South Korean’s unexpected win! The whole nation is enthusiastic! Praise Pagma’s Descendant!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The owner of the first legendary class is Korean? Shin Youngwoo, who is he?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The brilliant appearance of the man called Grid! A strong impact! Women’s hearts are thumping!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[&lt;Column&gt; Will Grid be able to regain South Korea’s reputation as a gaming powerhouse?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The whole world is watching Korea and Pagma’s Descendant! Entering the National Competition, it isn’t a dream!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Grid helped Jishuka, the Brazilian representative. What is the meaning of this action? Are the two people lovers?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, Satisfy’s influence was amazing. He became a global star in a manner of minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Shin Youngwoo read the Internet articles on his phone.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was completely excited, so he answered honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Transcended Link? I wanted to use it. But the cooldown time wasn’t over, so I didn’t.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It took exactly 14 minutes and 47 seconds for the Korean team to score 150 points after Youngwoo entered the competition and used Transcended Link.&nbsp;</span><span style>Based on that, Yura could figure out that the cooldown time of Transcended Link was at least 15 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Youngwoo-ssi didn’t use several of the skills he showed in the Bairan battle. Pagma’s Swordsmanship is strong, but its weakness is that it needs a sword dance to be invoked and has a long cooldown time.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura had analyzed Pagma’s Descendant dozens of times since the Bairan battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagma's Descendant. In other words, she was able to grasp the functions and power of the four skills that Youngwoo used during the Bairan battle, which were Transcended Link, Link, Kill and Wave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And the conclusion she came to was that it was ‘insufficient.’&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t a matter of talent, such as good or bad control.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pagma's Descendant was a class that was basically a blacksmith, so the combat skills were poor. The weaknesses were also clear.&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite being a legendary class, the fighting power seemed to be less than the epic classes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He has the strongest passive skill of ‘Status Immune’ and has the advantage of making legendary items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he couldn’t stand up to the best players.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the limit of a production class.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pagma's Descendant might be able to generate tremendous economic value, but it was relatively unimpressive in combat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the analysis of Yura and other experts.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, they were mistaken.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pagma was the best blacksmith and swordsman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, Youngwoo had several skills that hadn’t been shown to the public.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were Restraint, Transcend and Linked Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Youngwoo used either Restraint or Transcend, he would’ve been able to easily overpower Hurent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Restraint limited movements for three seconds, and it was possible to deal a fatal wound during that time. Or he could destroy Hurent with the overwhelming firepower of Transcend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That wasn’t all.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past, Youngwoo acquired the title of Apostle of Justice and learned the Unbreakable Justice skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>The mana consumption was burdensome and it was more efficient to use Pagma’s Swordsmanship, so he had sealed it for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo’s intelligence stat had steadily grown to 643 after four months of producing hundreds of items, including Failure. He would gain 200 more intelligence if he wore Malacus’ Cloak.&nbsp;</span><span style>A level 200 user would gain 6 mana per one point in intelligence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now Youngwoo was in a position to be able to use Unbreakable Justice easily with Pagma’s Swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unbreakable Justice was an immediate use skill, unlike Pagma’s Swordsmanship. Youngwoo could’ve used Unbreakable Justice against Hurent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That wasn’t the end.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was the Wind Blast and Wind of Justice attached to the Ideal Dagger, and Golden Flash attached to Dainsleif.&nbsp;</span><span style>Among them, Golden Flash was the only skill that dealt damage proportional to his magic power, so it was good at penetrating the enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, Youngwoo’s power was much more than what people grasped.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then why hadn’t Youngwoo used them?&nbsp;</span><span style>He saved his skills despite being humiliated by Hurent?&nbsp;</span><span style>The reason was simple. He didn’t want to expose his power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If it wasn’t for the pavranium, I would’ve eventually forced Hurent to logout. It was a disappointing result, because I stupidly overlooked the pavranium.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The National Competition wasn’t over yet. Today was only the second day.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Korean team was lacking and very reliant on Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Youngwoo was going to participate in the PvP event.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was prepared to unveil his real skills in the PvP event.&nbsp;</span><span style>Every time he met a new enemy, he would be able to demonstrate a more powerful appearance by introducing a new skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would be able to become a star by being a hot topic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I’ll get you back sooner or later ,Hurent. I will make you suffer the embarrassment I felt.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Control?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was nothing in front of the trinity of skills, stats and items.&nbsp;</span><span style>Aura Master? A hidden growth type class?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am a legendary class from the beginning.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was participating in the National Competition now.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would win a gold medal in his three events!&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo thought like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma's Descendant has come!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of the Korean team’s waiting room.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hundreds of reporters were gathered.&nbsp;</span><span style>The domestic and foreign reporters were all only paying attention to Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh my.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was being ignored.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura was always treated the best wherever she went, so this was a strange experience for her.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was her pride hurt?&nbsp;</span><span style>Not at all.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura was excited too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Be calm.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a lot of people. In particular, dealing with the press was very tiring. Thanks to Youngwoo, she was able to be freed from them, so she should stick to him in the future.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Youngwoo was surrounded by reporters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"When did you become Pagma's Descendant?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Please tell us the process of becoming Pagma's Descendant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What was your reason for hiding your identity in the meantime?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You aren’t registered in the rankings, so what level are you?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The current 1st ranked Kraugel is level 297. Have you already achieved level 300?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you disclose the information of your items? In particular, many people are wondering about the blue greatsword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What are those golden blades?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why weren’t you seen when you first entered the National Competition? Was it a skill? Or did you create an invisibility cloak, like many experts speculated?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What exactly is your relationship with Jishuka?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What school did you go to? Your age? Where do you live? Your family?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Are you married?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What type of animal do you like?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is your favorite food?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It started from questions that pierced to the core to absurd questions.&nbsp;</span><span style>The languages of different countries surrounded him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is crazy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo was confused because this was the first time he was experiencing it.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, Yura interfered. She said in English.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First of all, give Youngwoo-ssi time to wear an interpreter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reporters briefly fell silent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura belatedly received an interpreting device from a staff member and persuaded Youngwoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve revealed yourself, so it’s good to be interviewed. Answer as much as you want, but don’t be stupid. Keep as much privacy as possible while satisfying the reporters. If the reporters aren’t satisfied, you will be stuck with their persistent stalking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo had vowed to become a star from the moment he decided to participate in the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo took a deep breath and agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sigh... I understand. I’m nervous because I’m unfamiliar with interviews, but I will do it because it’s a gateway I must go through.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huhut.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This man, sometimes he made nice expressions.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura smiled and handed the interpreter to Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then finally, Youngwoo met the reporters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he was surprised from the first question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It looks like you have a special relationship with Yura. Are you perhaps lovers?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then what about Jishuka?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weren’t these questions supposed to be from third-rate magazines that dealt with celebrity scandals?&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo thought the question was ridiculous and fell silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura skillfully answered on his behalf.&nbsp;</span><span style>"We are close, but we aren’t lovers. It is a relationship where we share the purpose of gaining good achievements for South Korea in the National Competition. His relationship with Jishuka is similar. Youngwoo-ssi is part of the Tzedakah Guild.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura’s words didn’t show any interest in Youngwoo.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reporters no longer doubted the relationship between the three people.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then they started asking other questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“40 days ago in real time, there was a phrase that suggested the first legendary class emerged in Satisfy. Was that the moment you became Pagma's Descendant?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo became Pagma's Descendant eight months ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>40 days ago was when he produced his fifth legendary item and was truly recognized as Pagma’s Descendant.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Youngwoo didn’t tell the truth. There was no need to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s correct.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s your current level?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to reveal it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What are those golden discs and blades that move by themselves? Don’t they boast tremendous durability and mobility?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He also didn’t want to reveal this. But the reporters would become more persistent if he was too uncooperative.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura’s advice about moderately satisfying the reporters went around in Youngwoo’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can think of it as a private item for Pagma's Descendant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Private item?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is it an item that exists to supplement the somewhat lacking combat power of Pagma's Descendant?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo glared at the reporter who said ‘lacking combat power.’&nbsp;</span><span style>An American reporter didn’t miss this look and threw a provocative question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You were one-sidedly hit by the US representative, Hurent. Experts from all over the world have doubts about the combat capabilities of Pagma's Descendant. Pagma’s Descendant is the greatest blacksmith and swordsman, but did you inherit all his skills as a descendant?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was one-sidedly hit?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo scoffed and stared straight at the American reporter who asked the question.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he said something shocking.&nbsp;</span><span style>“That’s correct. I have yet to fully inherit Pagma’s power. My class change quest still isn’t finished yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura standing beside Youngwoo and the reporters all looked amazed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You haven’t finished the class quest yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is the incomplete state...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet he still won against many rankers and obtained the gold medal in the target processing event?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’m only a child compared to the legendary Pagma, but that is only when compared to Pagma.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo made a prideful expression and declared in front of the reporters.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Hurent? If he participates in PvP, I will log him out in 30 seconds.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Heok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was going to log out Hurent in 30 seconds, one of the best rankers, and 8th on the unified rankings!&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a huge scoop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Write it down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shin Youngwoo made a ridiculous declaration without a single tense look.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura’s heart jumped from beside him.</span></p>
