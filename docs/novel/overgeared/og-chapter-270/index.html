 <p><span style>Chapter 270</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Duke Grid! What are you doing outside today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Pascal, who was accompanied by his men.&nbsp;</span><span style>A person needed to bend in order to obtain anything big.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal was determined to obtain Grid and completely abandoned his pride.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He placed his disgrace deep into his heart and acted politely to Grid. He also didn’t forget to have a bright smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal instructed his men to drop the treasure chest.&nbsp;</span><span style>His eyes shone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because he found Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T-This...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The false smile that concealed his anger inside transformed into a real one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Isabel seems to have finally died.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was just like a cockroach.&nbsp;</span><span style>It would be more comfortable if she died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It feels like a 10 year blockage has finally been relieved.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rebecca's Daughters were meant to follow commands.&nbsp;</span><span style>They should be controlled.&nbsp;</span><span style>In that sense, Isabel, Rin, and Luna were truly troublesome.&nbsp;</span><span style>The former Pope Ruiz, who led the church to the light, and the former Pope Drevigo who corrupted the church.&nbsp;</span><span style>These girls served both popes, so they grew to a level where they could judge right and wrong.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rather than obeying orders unconditionally, they questioned it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They are tools.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>For Pascal, who planned to make the Rebecca Church a part of the Saharan Empire, the current Rebecca’s Daughters were an eyesore.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now Isabel was dead, so his worries had disappeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would give Lifael’s Spear to a new owner, then order Rin and Luna to be removed in turn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Finally, my world will come.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt like he was flying with joy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal’s heart wanted to burst out. But he refrained after looking at Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was looking at him with cold eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>"A girl who had her life sucked out for Goddess Rebecca and the church has died. Why are you so happy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Sucked out?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal’s face distorted.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to beat Grid up for using such words to diminish serving the noble goddess.&nbsp;</span><span style>But what about all his patience so far?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal barely repressed his anger and opened his mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style>“As you have said, Isabel is a child who has served the goddess and the church for all of her life. That child is heading to the goddess’ side... She can serve the goddess forever in the world of the gods and live happily ever after. I am happy and proud, so I can’t help smiling at the thought.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Bullshit.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid couldn’t stand the nonsense.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal handed him the treasure chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wish you would accept this today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Pascal wants to give you 1.8 million gold. Would you like to receive Pascal’s gift?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[If you receive the gift, you must unconditionally accept one of Pascal’s requests.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Damian won’t be pope anyway. What can he do if he wins the hearts of the congregation? There are only 100 senior priests with voting rights and at least 80% of them are already mine. Duke Grid, please look at the future and make a wise choice...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want it.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid interrupted Pascal’s words.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I have no intention of holding hands with you, when just looking at your face makes me nauseous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid hated Pascal.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was because Pascal resembled those who tormented him in the past.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t erase the image of Pascal bullying Damian and Isabel in his mind.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would never hold hands with Pascal, even if he was given 100 million gold.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the first place, political issues were also intertwined.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s too bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The smile had disappeared from Pascal’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style>His patience had reached its limit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then is it fine to stop talking nicely? For the past few days, I have done my best to be friends with you, but you always mock my efforts and insult me. Don’t you know the meaning of courtesy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why should I be polite to you? Don’t you usually enjoy mocking and insulting your opponent?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ack...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s attitude showed that he wouldn’t be persuaded.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal was nervous and spoke bluntly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Tell me what you want! I’m willing to give you whatever you want as long as you join my side! What would make you hold my hand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You will give me anything?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hoh, isn’t this very tempting?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was finally a nibble.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal was delighted and prepared to listen to Grid’s requirements.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid told him,&nbsp;</span><span style>"A thousand trillion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A thousand trillion?&nbsp;</span><span style>Was it the name of a treasure?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is the first time I’ve heard of it?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid spoke again to Pascal, who was struggling to understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Give me one thousand trillion gold. Then I will be your true friend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is crazy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He reflexively exclaimed.&nbsp;</span><span style>One thousand trillion gold was the empire’s treasury. No, it was an astronomical sum that would wipe out all the treasuries of the nations on the continent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid demanding such a ridiculous amount showed he wasn’t normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Crazy? You said you would give my anything I want, but I’m crazy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, no. I became delirious due to my shock...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid waved his hand at Pascal. He didn’t want to hear any excuses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The negotiations have collapsed. Then let’s each go our own way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid reached for Lifael’s Spear. It was for the purpose of moving to the smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the silently watching Kamiyan aimed his sword at Grid’s neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leave Lifael’s Spear. How long is an outsider going to carry the item of the church?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s eyes sank as he looked down at the shining blade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Second.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the second time you’ve pointed a sword at my neck. I’m the duke of a kingdom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan ridiculed him,&nbsp;</span><span style>“So what? Will you run to Wiesbaden, your king, and tell on me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The knight of another nation was disparaging his king.&nbsp;</span><span style>How heated would Grid become?&nbsp;</span><span style>Kamiyan deliberately tried to provoke Grid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid would lose his temper and be unable to use his skills properly.&nbsp;</span><span style>But his intentions came to naught.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the first place, Grid didn’t have much loyalty to the king.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s good that you called my king’s name as if he was the next door neighbor’s dog.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid grabbed Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[White Transformation is activated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You don’t have any divine power. White Transformation has failed to be activated. Side effects will occur to your body.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have resisted.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You can’t afford to play with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason that Grid couldn’t attack the elders and Pascal was due to the Goddess’ Curse.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, what about Kamiyan?&nbsp;</span><span style>He wasn’t a priest of the Rebecca Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no reason to hold back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid knew the strongest spearman, Pon.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had watched Pon fighting. In fact, they had sparred many times.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had developed an incomplete method of Pon’s spear technique.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The spear moved in a diagonal manner, causing Kamiyan’s sword to be deflected downwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan was surprised by the naturally flowing spear and stepped back.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid extended his right leg back in this gap and stabbed the spear forward.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[Lifael’s Spear’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘Light Wheel’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Lifael’s Spear’s option effect is activated, dealing an additional 5,000 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keook!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan couldn’t believe it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s stab suddenly shifted to a circle.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an irregular attack that even those with ‘Keen Senses’ couldn’t respond to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Cough! Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan was hit in his waist by a heavy blow, causing him to fall down while coughing up blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Such power...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan was stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style>The pain was as if his bones were broken, while his internal organs felt like they were going to burst.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the power of a myth rated weapon and skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T-this is impossible...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal was astonished as he watched Kamiyan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Red Knight.&nbsp;</span><span style>One of the strongest knights on the continent fell down so easily?&nbsp;</span><span style>There was something even more surprising.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"H-How can you use Lifael’s Spear?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Rebecca Church’s three divine artifacts were available only to selected beings.&nbsp;</span><span style>They needed to have innate transcendent divine power.&nbsp;</span><span style>The person also needed to pray to Goddess Rebecca for at least nine years.&nbsp;</span><span style>Finally...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They needed to be a woman!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y-You...”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid remained impassive as Pascal turned pale blue.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Grid, you! Are you a woman?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the most uncomfortable phrase Grid had heard since he was born.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t even worth arguing about, so the 181cm tall and sturdy Grid tightened his grip on Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style>He really meant to kill Kamiyan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal couldn’t accept it and used Heal.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kamiyan was able to recover thanks to this and rose from his spot.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was fear on his face as he fixed his sword posture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I has been a long time since I’ve seen Heal.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heal in Satisfy was much better than in usual games.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because too much had to be given up in order to become Rebecca’s priests.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were very few users who chose to become a Rebecca priest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There are too many eyes watching.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>People were flocking to the garden.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid believed that killing Kamiyan could adversely affect Damian’s election, so he withdrew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will leave it for today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan’s eyes glared at he gazed after Grid who was leaving leisurely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Kill...! I will kill you Grid!’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason he was defeated today was due to his carelessness.&nbsp;</span><span style>He never dreamt that Grid could use a divine weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Damn bastard!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The wound in his side was causing him severe pain. He felt nauseous.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kamiyan pledged that he would make Grid kneel in a week when Earl Chirita back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I am going.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The smithy inside the Vatican.&nbsp;</span><span style>The weapons for paladins were produced here. Grid held the Legendary Blacksmith’s Hammer in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shall I begin?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style>The weapon that a god made was reinterpreted by human hands.</span></p>
