 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[The duration of immortality is over.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[You have suffered 30,900 damage!]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[You have died.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is different from what I heard from Grid.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just like all the former Tzedakah Guild’s members, Jishuka had heard the story of Grid’s class change—he suffered all sorts of hardships before reaching the North End Cave and getting his hands on Pagma’s Rare Book...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grid’s story about obtaining the first legendary class stimulated the imagination of the Tzedakah Guild’s members. Grid had to repeat the story multiple times to the colleagues who always wanted to hear it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Grid entered the immortal state shortly after the class change.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jishuka was different. She became immortal from the beginning. This allowed her to withstand Agnus’ strike and fight back. The result was a defeat. Agnus was terribly strong—it wasn’t enough that he single-handedly pushed the army of the Cho Kingdom to the verge of collapse, he didn’t fall down even when hit by Fly Up!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘To be honest, he is several times stronger than me. I wouldn’t have enjoyed this luck if the timing of my surprise attack had been a little bit off.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was effective because she aimed at the timing when Agnus had consumed all his death knights and was reviving the army of the dead. She apologized to the people and soldiers of the Cho Kingdom, but it was worth the wait.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘My ability wasn’t enough to help you from the start. I’m sorry.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She would’ve been killed if she joined the front lines from the beginning. She couldn’t have survived the intense bombardment of the death knights and lich. There wouldn’t have been a situation where she met Lantier.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Such a monster is a player like us...’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jishuka was one of the most powerful players out of two billion players. Her overall combat power was within the top 10. Such a Jishuka felt a wall against Lantier, who was just one of Agnus’ summons. If Agnus hadn’t used his magic without caring about the target, Jishuka would’ve likely been defeated by Lantier.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Additionally, Agnus had Lich Mumud and a few more death knights. An unidentified magician boy had also joined in. It was Jishuka’s judgment that Agnus alone could take on dozens of high rankers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘He is almost at Grid’s level...’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, she was certain about one thing—Agnus was weaker than Grid. His undead army couldn’t beat Grid’s army of items. She just wondered if this structure could be maintained after two or three years... Agnus’ potential was too high. At the moment, Agnus didn’t show many of his class traits. The evidence was the small number of skills he used compared to Grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Well, it doesn’t matter how strong he is.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She was by Grid’s side. The ‘Bow Saint’ Jishuka would protect Grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">...Jishuka was filled with this burning desire despite being level 1. She enjoyed immortality from the beginning, unlike Grid, but her level was reset just like Grid. However, there were clear differences from Grid. She heard that Grid had experienced a constant loss of levels right after changing class.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Hidden Quest ★Proof of Birth ★is in progress.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jishuka had a chance to restore her level. Proof of Birth was a six stage quest and every time one stage was cleared, dozens of lost levels would be restored. She would recover at least 350 levels if she completed all six stages. Was it the benefit of becoming a legend using her own power, unlike Grid who inherited the skills of others? Come to think of it, Kraugel’s level recovery was also relatively slow.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Did they take action because the average level of players has increased?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The top rankers were aiming for level 400. In this situation, restarting the game at level 1 actually meant quitting the game. Meanwhile, the rankers had an average level of 200 when Grid changed classes and reset his level, and were aiming at the mid-300s when Kraugel’s level was reset. This meant that even if the level was reset to the initial stage, there was enough room to catch up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the other hand, the experience required in the late 300s was different. In particular, it became hell starting from level 380, especially for Jishuka whose level had been above 380. It was too harsh for her to start at level 1 again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Maybe the timing of Grid and Kraugel’s class change was faster than the S.A Group predicted...’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They were truly great people. They deserved to be her goal. She was going to stand shoulder to shoulder with them. Jishuka smiled pleasantly and activated Clairvoyance. It was the evolution of the Hawk Eyes skill. Jishuka’s vision became like a satellite and captured all of Kars with one glance. All the topography and conditions of Kars were conveyed to Jishuka.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;‘It will take some time to get used to it.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The new form of vision instilled some tension even for Jishuka. She gulped and watched the palace that was three kilometers ahead. She could see Agnus’ dying figure as he was surrounded by the soldiers of the Cho Kingdom. It seemed to be just before the end of the undead transformation period.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jishuka didn’t miss this opportunity. She drew back the string of the Red Phoenix Bow. The lock-on system was activated. The system kept aiming even if her aim was disturbed during the process.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;‘Isn’t this crazy?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The time it took to aim at the target was dramatically reduced. Additionally, the speed at which the arrow was fired was faster. The Bow Saint’s arrow was faster than a bullet and as precise as a missile. Just—&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[You have dealt 135 damage to the target.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">...Ah</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, no.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A legendary class wasn’t an all-rounder. Jishuka’s attack power at level 1 barely dealt any damage to Agnus who had just passed the mid-300s. Still, Jishuka’s mood wasn’t bad. Agnus was pierced by the spears of the surviving soldiers and turned to gray ash. She was happy because she paid back the death she just suffered. At the same time, she felt anxious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I think he will come back again because of his personality.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Agnus wouldn’t have attacked the royal palace for no reason. He also never missed a prey. He would surely come back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Even so, won’t Agnus need at least 10 days to gather thousands of troops again?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He wouldn’t be able to trust in his death knights alone unless he wanted to be killed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Until then, I will try to restore as many levels as possible and gain the Breaking Evil Arrows.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A smile spread across Jishuka’s face. For her, who dreamed of becoming the supreme one since the beginning of the game, a conflict with other competitors was enjoyable. It was a chance to smash the opponent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><br></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m done. How about it? Do you like it?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“...Yes. I like it very much. I want it to be a family heirloom.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Come back anything if you have something to ask. I’m always thankful to you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m also always grateful...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Damian embraced the new shield and armor Grid made for him. He usually would’ve been happy enough to fly, but he now left the smithy with a depressed look. The burden in his heart was too great to rejoice. He lost to a sword...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dammit, dammit, dammit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unlike Damian, who couldn’t withstand the sense of shame, Grid’s expression was very bright.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It is beyond my imagination.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The strength of the Fire Dragon Sword was amazing. The strength of the sword who acted alone while using False Dragon Words and Breath was more powerful than the average ranker. Due to the structure of the Fire Dragon Sword, players who weren’t Grid couldn’t fight the Fire Dragon Sword and win.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The first reason was the infinite durability. Players had limited health and stamina while the sword had no such limits. It didn’t get tired, wouldn’t break, and continued to push the opponent, making them tired. The lack of additional stats that meant its attack power was lacking was made up with the fixed damage of the breath and the effect of False Dragon Words when it came to binding the target was excellent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the greatest strength of the Fire Dragon Sword was that it only allowed Grid to be its owner. Damian judged that there was no chance of winning a long battle against the Fire Dragon Sword. He sought to suppress the Fire Dragon Sword and succeeded in grabbing its handle...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">'In return, he was roasted.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It meant that targets who fought the Fire Dragon Sword had no means to defeat the Fire Dragon Sword. It was possible to make a draw by binding it or running away with magic, but it was impossible to defeat it. First, there was Talsha and now the Fire Dragon Sword...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grid felt like he had won thousands of troops. He even felt confident that he could achieve a tie if he fought the 13th Great Demon Beleth again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘By the way...’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grid checked the time and frowned. It had been two days since the world message about the birth of the Bow Saint and Jishuka hadn’t returned. He had asked when she would show the power of the Bow Saint and only received the brief answer ‘sooner or later’ in return.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Honestly, Grid was sad. He thought she would run to him for congratulations the moment she became a legend...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It will be very hard to start over from level 1.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Putting aside her crush, Jishuka was a friend, a colleague, and one of the greatest powers of the Overgeared Kingdom.

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The shadow that protected the Overgeared Kingdom—God of Death, Faker, who had never been disheveled, abruptly showed up with an injured appearance and fell beside Grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Faker! Hey! What's going on?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The startled Grid supported Faker. He was dying. A poison so powerful that it couldn’t be detoxified was spreading through Faker’s body.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Faker couldn’t speak to the end and his hands fell to the cold marble floor. Grid hugged Faker and screamed, “Fakeeeeer!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Faker turned to ash. Then two seconds later...</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The emperor is alive,” the resurrected Faker spoke as he approached Grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
