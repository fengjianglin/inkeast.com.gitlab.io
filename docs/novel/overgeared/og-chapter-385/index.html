 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Linked Kill Wave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...What!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The disadvantage of Pagma’s Swordsmanship was its high mana consumption and long cooldowns.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he overcame those shortcomings with the powerful combination of skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid knew that it was possible to combine the skills of Pagma’s Swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style>But according to the experiments conducted by Grid, it was limited to combining two skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid’s clone had combined three skills.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I never managed to do it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The impact on Grid was great.&nbsp;</span><span style>It showed a skill combination that he didn’t even know about?&nbsp;</span><span style>His pride was hurt and he was confused. Now he couldn’t afford to be worried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s urgent to determine what skills it has.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The time that passed was less than a second.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s brain started turning quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In the case of the level 2 Linked Kill, the power of Kill is weakened, but it can shoot anywhere from 3~8 attacks.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then what if Wave was added to it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It can’t be!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A terrible thought passed through Grid’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Will Kill be continuously unfolded in a wave?'</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, that was too much of a scam.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was no way. He tried to shake his head, but couldn’t help but have a bad feeling.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kurururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s clone moved its sword in the air and quickly connected Kill.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The red afterglow of Kill was overlaid with the blue of Wave, spreading out in all directions.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was truly overwhelming.&nbsp;</span><span style>The power of each one was lethal, and also had the slowing function of Wave. &nbsp;Grid used Fly to escape, but it chased after him like a hungry beast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Unbelievable!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid felt like when he was confronting Piaro’s skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>The fusion of three of Pagma’s Swordsmanship skills was powerful and perfect.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yes, this was a true legendary skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I must learn it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid felt admiration, astonishment, and desperation.&nbsp;</span><span style>He needed to cope with the eight Kills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>His past self would’ve likely been hit before he could escape.&nbsp;</span><span style>But.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have Revolve.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Revolve had a cooldown time of 2 minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style>But using it first would be disadvantageous.&nbsp;</span><span style>What if he used Revolve? The other side would also use Revolve to send it back to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Not yet.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid summoned four God Hands to block four of the Kill attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the clone also used his God Hands to keep Grid’s God Hands in check.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Dammit!’ </span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid saw that the God Hands were blocked and summoned Randy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Change locations with me!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Yes!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He felt sorry and ashamed that he had to sacrifice Randy.&nbsp;</span><span style>But what could he do?&nbsp;</span><span style>A user would lose experience and items when dying, but a pet only received the penalty of not being summoned for 24 hours.&nbsp;</span><span style>Objectively, it was right to sacrifice Randy instead of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Supak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Randy copied Grid’s appearance as soon as he appeared and changed positions with Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, Randy was hit by the eight Kill attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kyaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Randy cried out with pain as he turned to grey.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid felt a stinging pain in his chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Doppelganger Randy's health has fallen to 0.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Randy is forced to return to the pet inventory. You can’t summon it for the next 24 hours.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s eyes were grim as he saw the rising notification windows.&nbsp;</span><span style>Randy and Kill collided, causing an explosion. Then Grid moved through it and used Kill on the clone.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid wanted his clone to respond with Revolve.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid would then respond with the Lv.3 Revolve, which returned 160% of the damage. He could neutralize the counterattack and cause more damage at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the clone didn’t do as Grid wanted.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unlike the stupid BOT (artificial intelligence players) that could be seen in normal games, Grid’s clone was equipped with the artificial intelligence of a named NPC.&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone recognized the fact that using Revolve first was a disadvantage.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was perfectly calculated.&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone judged that he wouldn’t die even if he was stabbed in the heart with Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style>A chill went down Grid’s spine.&nbsp;</span><span style>The clone started moving his feet the moment he was hit by Kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'This is the footwork of Link...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kill had straight footwork, while Link was curved.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, Grid judged that it was possible to avoid Kill using the movements of Link.&nbsp;</span><span style>In fact, Grid’s clone knew it as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Halt!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clone used the footwork of Kill to move backwards, then moved to the left and right.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this point, Grid cut at his clone with Link.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pit!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pipipipipit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Blood splattered.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the momentum of Grid’s clone didn’t die.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid received solid evidence.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s clone succeeded in using a skill while hit by Link.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pinnacle Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Combining a skill without using Link as the medium?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this moment, Grid’s confusion was reaching the extreme.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the countless battle experience he’d built up so far wasn’t in vain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid acted instinctively.&nbsp;</span><span style>He responded by twisting the trajectory of Link to cut the Pinnacle Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Link was a technique that focused on speed rather than power. The power wasn’t comparable to Pinnacle Kill or Kill. It was a bad idea to defend against the combined Pinnacle Kill with Link.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Pinnacle Kill crushed the power of Link.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 59,300 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid let out a large scream and felt stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style>A targeted skill that combined the power of Kill and Pinnacle.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an outrageous power that made Grid’s defense obsolete.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have lost more than half of your health in one blow! You will be stunned for three seconds!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Resisted with the passive effect of One who Became a Legend.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid hurriedly moved.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to use Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Wave, to open up the distance and escape.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, there was a clear difference between Grid and Grid’s clone.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment that Grid’s clone used Linked Kill Wave, Grid had tried to find a way to avoid it. But the clone’s main focus was on blocking Grid’s skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>This meant that the clone was a cut above Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid shook tremendously as he used Wave.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because the clone precisely broke his ankle, causing his posture to collapse.&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to that, the skill casting was cancelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This rotten person knows my weaknesses better than me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t help cursing.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was still lacking.&nbsp;</span><span style>He hated his own ignorance that allowed the clone to stop his casting.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Swaeek!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Iyarugt was swung towards Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>After using the skill with Grid’s Greatsword, it had swapped to Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was proof that the clone had high comprehension of items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blackening.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Black magic exploded with Grid in the center.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid avoided the enemy’s attacks while confirming his rising stats. He linked Blacksmith’s Rage and Quick Movements, before using Linked Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was so fast that Grid’s clone couldn’t prevent it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 35,300 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 36,106 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I did it properly!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He stabbed the greatsword forward and bet on his victory.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid believed he would clear the 40th island the moment that the next Linked Kill strike was about to strike flesh&nbsp;</span><span style>But what was the truth?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the wrong judgment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The target has recovered 54,159 health.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doran’s Ring instantly restored 50% of the damage as health, while the Holy Light Armor raised health regeneration by 300%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s clone quickly restored his health by taking advantage of these two items. He followed up with Blacksmith’s Rage and Quick Movements, succeeding in avoiding Grid’s third Linked Kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s a scam.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The effect of Doran’s Ring and the Holy Light Armor was ridiculously excellent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Had he been using such fraudulent items all this time?&nbsp;</span><span style>He felt sorry for all the enemies he’d faced in the meantime.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Well, whatever.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doran’s Ring had a cooldown time of 10 minutes. Grid hadn’t used Doran’s Ring yet. He had one more card than the clone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'...It’s still absurd.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clone might show new fusion skills in the future.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid clicked his tongue and fired the remaining Linked Kill.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the clone responded in an unexpected manner.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t avoid and responded with Revolve?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘Now!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smiled with satisfaction and counterattacked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Revolve.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjeejeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Revolve was countered with Revolve.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the ideal result!&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid cheered as the energy of Linked Kill became incomparable to before. It was immensely powerful.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was confident this would defeat the clone in one shot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Revolve.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A new Grid appeared behind the clone and used Revolve?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Doppelganger Randy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It also cloned the pet!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A notification window popped up in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered fatal damage!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A legend doesn’t die easily. You can resist all attacks for 5 seconds with a minimum of health.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid realized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I lost.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t win like this.&nbsp;</span><span style>A dark smile appeared on Grid’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was it an insane smile?&nbsp;</span><span style>No, he was smiling with joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to do it again.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Until the advent of the National Competition, he would absorb everything and grow.</span></p>
