 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The media in each country reported the news that the first second class had appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>South Korea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Did you know that there was a second class? When a second class is obtained, the user has access to a wider range of weapons, skills and stats. In addition, every level up will give two additional stat points. Reporter Cho Sungjin will give more details. Reporter Cho Sungjin.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;This is Cho Sungjin. At 1 a.m. today, information from the S.A. Group was released, revealing that the first second class was obtained in Satisfy. The type of second class hasn’t been revealed yet, but experts predict that there is so much content in Satisfy that a myriad of second classes exist. The biggest advantage of getting a second class is that 12 stat points instead of 10 will be obtained with each level up...&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The United States.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;James, what is the identity of the first second class that emerged?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;The S.A Group said that is isn’t willing to disclose information about the second class that appeared. This is a decision to protect the information of the person who acquired the second class...&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The United Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I just received incredible breaking news. The first person who obtained the second class is from Mongolia.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;They’re from Mongolia? Do Mongols even know what Satisfy is?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Haha, these statistics definitely show that Mongols aren’t interested in Satisfy. In most developed countries, around 60% of the population is playing Satisfy. Meanwhile, only 3% of the Mongolian population is playing Satisfy.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Oh dear... According to this statistic, our UK has 68% of the population playing Satisfy? This 68% of the British population couldn’t acquire a second class, yet someone in Mongolia did... The British are advertising to the world that they aren’t talented in the game.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>China.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;The S.A. Group is renowned for thoroughly managing their customer’s information. Experts speculate that the information about the first second class being obtained by a Mongolian user was spread in order to promote Satisfy in Mongolia.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It is clear that the S.A. Group intends to dominate the world with Satisfy. Then intend to make everyone in the world slaves to Satisfy. Later on, the whole world might be dancing in the S.A. Group’s hands. People will need treatment for Satisfy addiction...&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Japan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I’m proud that it’s an Asian who acquired the first second class. When will a second class user be born in Japan?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;As you know, 71% of Japan’s population is enjoying Satisfy. There are many Japanese people who are playing Satisfy. Didn’t a Japanese person obtain an epic class a few months ago? I expect a Japanese person to be the second user to obtain a second class.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Doesn’t Korea have 73% of its population playing Satisfy? According to population ratio, Koreans enjoy Satisfy the most. Is there any possibility that the owner of the second user to obtain a second class will be born in Korea?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;...Perhaps the S.A. Group will help a Korean obtain it...&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;There are no successful Korean users except for Yura, who is ranked 5th on the unified rankings. This is ironic, considering that Satisfy is a game made by a Korean company.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Speaking of which, there is a rumor that the S.A. Group is sponsoring Yura.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Is that so? What is the source of the rumor?&gt;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;That... on the net...&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Please refrain from making unfounded remarks. The slightest slip can cause an international issue.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;I’m sorry...&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>People’s interest in the second class was so high that the media from all over the world organized a special program for the first second class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Shin Youngwoo sighed after escaping from the dungeon, leaving Rabbit and logging out.&nbsp;</span><span style>As soon as he opened his eyes, he sat in front of the TV, boiled ramyun and trembled as he watched the news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m really envious... Getting two more stat points with every level up, isn’t that completely a scam? What bastard got a second class? Ah, damn. I’m sick from envy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shin Youngwoo couldn’t even imagine that he knew the first person who acquired the second class.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The whole family gathered for dinner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I declared in front of my family,&nbsp;</span><span style>“I won’t go to the labor office anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a bolt from the blue!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"My son Youngwoo. You finally got a job? Great, my son! I believed in you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, Oppa! Are you going to be an employee now? Congratulations! What should I prepare as a celebration gift?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sob sob, Mother has been heartbroken in the meantime from all your suffering at the construction sites. Haven’t you gone through a lot of trouble so far?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I expected such reactions from my family.&nbsp;</span><span style>But reality was cruel.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tak!</span></i><span style> There was a loud sound as my father placed the spoon down on the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Are you going to start your life again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My mother sighed.&nbsp;</span><span style>"No matter how hard you work... How will you pay back the debt in the future and what will you do about marriage...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee clicked her tongue.&nbsp;</span><span style>"How can an adult be so selfish? Are you thinking about relying on our parents until you’re old? Oppa is terrible, how pathetic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unbelievable... Was this my family?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is planning on playing around at home?”&nbsp;</span><span style>I exclaimed.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Why do you think that stopping the labor jobs is a sign of giving up? Why don’t you think that your son and your Oppa has found a new job?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee’s eyes widened like she was really surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style>“What? Oppa got a new job? There is a place that will accept Oppa?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My mother spoke to herself.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Perhaps it is a job at a convenience store...? A convenience store job is easy, but the hourly rate is less than the labor jobs...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My father asked me with a serious face.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Youngwoo, you haven’t been deceived by a friend and dragged into a multi-level company like last time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey! It isn’t anything like that! I have an incredibly good job!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is a professional gamer. I will make money from the game! Don’t you know that I’m a blacksmith in the game? This is a really good job and I can sell my items for an expensive price. With a little more luck, I can earn the equivalent of a CEO salary someday. A great merchant in the game has promised to support me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the sudden silence, my father spoke in an angry voice.&nbsp;</span><span style>"...So you want to stay home and play games?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What? Why was he mad?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It is easy to say. The more I play the game, the more money I can earn. Maybe I should live in the capsule all day. Hehe.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttaak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Keook...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The spoon flew and hit my forehead.&nbsp;</span><span style>My mother gave my father a new spoon and he threw it at my forehead again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ack! Why? Why all of a sudden?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Tomorrow, go to the labor office.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, why? Didn’t you hear my words? I will make money from the game!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My mother wiped at her tears.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Gosh, your brother is really serious. You shouldn’t be like this, Sehee.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was my mother saying?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee bit her lip angrily and shouted,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Please grow up, Oppa! You’re going to make money from the game? Haven’t you been playing for the past year? And your debt has only increased! Face reality!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No... it’s different now. I have a new fate now that I’m a blacksmith... I’ve gone through a lot of things and now the best merchant will help me...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Stop talking about the game! The game is a joke!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I tried to explain the details but they didn’t listen to me.&nbsp;</span><span style>As I looked at the dark scene of chaos unfolding in front of me, I realized my family wouldn’t believe me even if I explained it properly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the next morning.&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to my crying mother, I had to change clothes and go to the workplace.&nbsp;</span><span style>I took a labor job and worked out the plan for the rest of my life.&nbsp;</span><span style>I needed to level up and complete the class quest, but the most important thing was making money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘First, let’s accept Rabbit’s proposal.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I didn’t know yet how Rabbit would help me get rich. But I was sure that it wasn’t an exaggeration. He was the second highest ranked person in the Mero Company, so he was obviously great. It would be good to trust him as a business partner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I use Khan’s smithy as a base, I can be very comfortable... Well, I hope to have more time to play the game. But first of all, I need to make money inside the game so that my parents will apologize.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy news could be found at any time when turning on the TV or Internet.&nbsp;</span><span style>My parents should’ve come across people who became world famous or rich through Satisfy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>But nevertheless, they didn’t think I could make money with Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>As Sehee said, it was because I spent one year... no, to be exact, I spent a year and a month already playing Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'It isn’t unreasonable that they don’t trust me... I need proof to persuade my parents.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>That evening.&nbsp;</span><span style>I came home from work and immediately connected to Satisfy. Then I went to Khan’s smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh, welcome Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan greeted me with an incredibly bright expression.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t just him. The anxiety on all the faces of the residents that I passed by had disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is Winston at peace? It looks like Euphemina and Rabbit did a good job.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I asked Khan,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Has Rabbit came here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan’s expression darkened.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Um... this letter arrived for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan handed me a letter.&nbsp;</span><span style>I read it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Mr. Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This is Rabbit. Earl Steim couldn’t excuse all the sins I committed against the people of Winston when I was still part of the Mero Company, so I couldn’t receive a full pardon. My business plan with you is in vain. Mr Grid, with your abilities, you will become the richest person with your own strength. Please ask for Khan’s advice and make wonderful items. Khan’s artistic sense will be a great help to you. I will watch your myth from a distance and sincerely pray for your success.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was this?</span></p>
