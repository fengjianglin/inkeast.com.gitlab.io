 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I felt like I was being ignored as I saw my mother’s reaction.&nbsp;</span><span style>I felt bad and questioned my mother,</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Mother, why are you laughing? Why are you laughing when I said that I could have a girlfriend?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My mother couldn’t stop laughing,</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hohohoho~! It's funny when a kid who's lived for 26 years and never got a girlfriend speaks so proudly. You are my child, but you are really amazing! My be.lly hu.rt.s. Hohohohohoho~!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was obviously ignorance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was there another son in the world who would be so ignorantly ignored by his mother?&nbsp;</span><span style>As I wobbled away in shock, my father backed my mother up instead of scolding her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Son, please make sure to have a girlfriend by next year. Shouldn’t you be prepared? No, think about other things first. Shouldn’t you pay off your debt first? What type of woman would want to date you when you are like this? No matter how confident you are, it isn’t easy. Do you think a meager man like you can instill confidence in your lover? Just give up on having a girlfriend for a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was also obviously ignorance.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was a morning where I felt better than ever!&nbsp;</span><span style>My heart, which was in the best condition, crumbled at my parents’ words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Both of you are too much! There is a reason why I haven’t had a girlfriend yet! My debt isn’t a problem. You two are the ones who made me like this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I poured out the words that I had buried in my heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t have a lover because of Mother and Father! If you two had made me like a movie star, I would be able to get a girlfriend. Dammit. The two of you made me ugly, so the girls don’t care about me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Gosh, are you blaming us for being born this way? Look at your sister. She came out from the same belly as you, but she is so beautiful. Did you know that you were also born beautiful like Sehee?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"People aren’t all about appearance...it is also about personality. Tsk tsk, the more I look, the more pathetic you are.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eek...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was being humiliated like this in the morning!&nbsp;</span><span style>Serious doubts revolved around my head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Was I adopted as a child?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maybe my parents aren’t actually my parents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘My parents said I was a beautiful baby, but are they really my parents...? Am I just a kid they picked up?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two people who raised me for 26 years weren’t actually my parents!&nbsp;</span><span style>Then what about my real parents? Where were my parents?</span></p>
 <p><span style>...No, what was I doing now?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was almost time to go work. I couldn’t afford to play around like this.&nbsp;</span><span style>I calmed down. Then I sat down at the table and turned to my father, changing the topic.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father, how is Grandfather these days? Is he healthy as always?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? Why are you suddenly asking about your grandfather?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is an old NPC blacksmith in the game, and he reminded me of Grandfather. So I suddenly remembered Grandfather.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>...Would he become angry again after hearing about the game?&nbsp;</span><span style>No, maybe he would beat me up...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You just suddenly thought about him.”&nbsp;</span><span style>My father said in a flat voice.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Then you should come along with I go to visit your grandfather next month. Do you know how sorry you should be for not visiting your grandfather for one year?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My family had been visiting my grandparents’ house every holiday since seven years ago. Seven years ago, my grandmother died and it was an attempt to soothe my grandfather’s loneliness.&nbsp;</span><span style>Mother and Father tried to persuade my grandfather to stay with us, but he firmly rejected. Perhaps he thought he would be a burden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I had been loved by my grandfather since I was young, so I visited him every year until last year.&nbsp;</span><span style>I never once visited after starting Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>I wanted to play the game instead of taking time off to travel to my grandfather’s house.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I was an unfilial bastard.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was my grandfather currently lonely, just like Khan?&nbsp;</span><span style>I was worried because I was able to get a glimpse through Khan about how lonely old men could act.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the future, I should try and visit my grandfather as frequently as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I ate well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, I finished breakfast and immediately headed towards my workplace.&nbsp;</span><span style>The people who already arrived filled the office with tobacco smoke.&nbsp;</span><span style>The cigarette smoke was causing me to get a headache.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why do they like smoking, when cigarettes are a waste of effort and money. If I had the money spent on buying cigarettes...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Let’s endure it a little longer. Once the item manufacturing was in full swing, I would no longer have to go back here.&nbsp;</span><span style>I could make a large amount of money by making and selling items.&nbsp;</span><span style>From then on, Satisfy will become my job. I could lie in my capsule all day and not have to listen to my parents’ nagging.&nbsp;</span><span style>But for that to happen, I needed to win against the Mero Company.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can use Khan’s smithy as a base. I must win the game and protect Khan’s smithy.’</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The Mero Company’s Winston branch.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Valmont wasn't feeling good. It was because he felt disappointed with his most trusted subordinate, Rabbit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why did you do such an annoying thing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A production game over the smithy?&nbsp;</span><span style>Valmont couldn’t understand Rabbit’s intentions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If Khan can’t pay me back, it is natural to use the smithy as collateral. And Khan doesn’t have the ability to pay off the debt. In other words, the smithy is sure to enter my hand. It is only a matter of time, whether it is slow or fast. I wanted to speed that up, which is why I let you handle the matter. But have you forgotten your mission?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bam!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Valmont threw the apple he was chewing against the wall.&nbsp;</span><span style>The pieces of apple splattered against Rabbit’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rabbit quietly took out his handkerchief and wiped his dirty face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Valmont huffed as he saw Rabbit’s dignified manner and shouted.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Why are you giving Khan hope by making a useless bet? Why? You opened up the opportunity that he might be able to keep the smithy. Have you been bribed by Khan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit was a person he had trusted more than anyone before today.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a simple example that revealed Valmont’s character, who didn’t trust people well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit explained calmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Right now, our main base is in Winston. But unfortunately, the Winston residents have recognized the Mero Company as their enemy. Considering the long-term perspective of the Mero Company’s business development, it is best to be friendly with the Winston residents. They have to care about the Mero Company in order to help develop it. But the Mero Company has taken their property. It won’t be easy to appease them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The company... took their property? Bah! Sophistry! The value of their land was shit. I paid for and bought them legally. They also welcomed it. Now they regret it as the land develops and the prices rise? Truly treacherous guys!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"They wouldn’t be so alarmed right now if you used some of the profits from the land to benefit them. Then they would’ve appreciated it and contributed to the development of the Mero Company in the long term.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"In other words, I am the bad one? Bah! The residents of Winston are still criticizing all the work I have done.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“’Don’t look at the backs of people. You will succeed by following the money.’ My master had that type of strategy. But my opinion is a little different. It is important to catch the hearts of the people. Then the money will come naturally. People grateful to the Mero Company will develop into loyal customers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You...!”&nbsp;</span><span style>Valmont looked at Rabbit in a menacing manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>"Don’t try to teach me! Do I look like a child to you? You just have to do what I tell you to. And what is with this bullshit? Get to the point! Why did you make such a lousy bet with Khan?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is the limit of Valmont. It will be difficult to grow the Mero Company any further.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason why the Mero Company could grow this big was because Valmont, when he was still young, had listened to Rabbit’s advice and operated the business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>But now Valmont was filled with arrogance and egotism, and he didn’t listen to Rabbit’s advice anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Once this business finishes, I need to leave.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit made his decision and decided to explain his intentions to Valmont.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Khan’s position in Winston is very high. There are many people who consider him the hero who resists the Mero Company. In these circumstances, if the Mero Company takes Khan’s smithy in a nasty manner, the anger of the residents will go out of control and will likely lead to a rebellion. The residents will work as a group to hinder the Mero Company, ultimately dealing harm to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Valmont started to listen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit continued the explanation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"I am confident that I can reform the company’s image through this game. ‘Why did they give a chance to Khan, when they can just take his smithy?’ The residents will start feeling this suspicion. Then I will advertise that ‘we recognized Khan’s skill and want to give him a chance.’ This suggests that the Mero Company can be a friend rather than an enemy. Then the population’s perception of the company will change drastically. They will think that the Mero Company doesn’t only move for money, that is also cares for people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...So we will gain loyal customers?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hrmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Valmont still wasn’t convinced.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he didn’t feel the need to stop something that had already been started.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, Valmont decided to support Rabbit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you hire an excellent blacksmith then we can win right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"In addition, the opponent isn’t Khan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"According to my research, he is a young man whose reputation is so poor that it is doubtful he is even a blacksmith.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay. Hire the best blacksmith. Don’t worry about the money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Valmont &nbsp;was insufficient in many ways, but a positive was that he was quick to make decisions.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he had no positive aspects, how could he become the master of a giant company in the first place?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit smiled with satisfaction.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I have already found a person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how bad Khan’s condition was, he wasn’t stupid enough to entrust it to an unskilled person.&nbsp;</span><span style>So Rabbit wanted to watch out for the young man called Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>But when Rabbit met Grid, he saw that Grid had no experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a person he couldn’t feel alert against.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit was convinced that if he chose a suitable blacksmith, they wouldn’t lose the game.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can’t be careless.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Rabbit had a cautious nature. He tried to get the best results every time. So he would be vigilant this time.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was going to hire the best blacksmith.</span></p>
