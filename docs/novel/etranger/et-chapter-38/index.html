 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone put their hands across their midsection and bowed to show courtesy to the estate owner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">He had absolute authority here. He dictated what the estate’s residents could or could not do, and possesse</span><span style="font-weight: 400">d</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;decision making power on all&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">things</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;related to his lands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San and Biyeon’s expressions subtly changed. They&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">exchanged</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;a look with each other and non-verbally agreed to something. They had been very concerned and attentive&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">about</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;this person.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;bent his upper body slightly and showed respect to the Count. Biyeon also bowed her head deeply to show her respect to the landlord.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">They didn’t know if their method of showing respect was the same as it was in modern Korea, but they felt that the general meaning&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">w</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ould be guessed and ultimately conveyed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Count Essen laughed out loud and stepped forward towards the two. He rubbed his palms together and greeted the two with a cheerful voice. He looked r</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ather</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;happy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I saw a truly impressive display of martial arts ability today. Is it the first time on my estate for you both?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That is correct. It hasn’t been long since we entered into th</span><span style="font-weight: 400">is</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;world from the wilderness, so please excuse any of our social shortcomings,” San calmly responded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He thought that his response was both courteous and reserved.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How long are you planning to stay here?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard that a hunt would be taking place after a few days. We will stay until then.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Five days! If you were planning on participating in the hunt, I’d like to thank you very much. With your skills, you can reduce the troublesome monsters that terrorize our residents. There are many dangerous beasts inhabiting our forests, so there are constant threats and difficulties in managing</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;my</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;estate. Truthfully, I was worried because of the unusually high appearance of beasts this year, but it would be a great help if both of you&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">participated</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;in the hunt.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If we can help, we will also be happy to oblige,” Biyeon replied.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Essen turned to look at Biyeon. His eyes were full of interest. Her appearance and mood were starkly different from the native women in the area.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though many female Warriors were produced during the 30-year continental war, they still made up a very small number.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Count was able to survive on the battlefield for more than 20 years, so he instantly recognized Biyeon as a high-level Warrior.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tattered gloves, masculine attire, a sword on her waist, an unknown weapon attached to her backpack, and a scar that&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">was</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;faintly visible on her face and wrists…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All of these details eloquently confirmed that this woman was not just a hunter. In particular, the woman’s speech and attitude when greeting a noble like himself were very natural.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She was of either noble status, unlike what her outfit conveyed, or a person who was used to dealing with nobles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Essen nodded. He looked back towards San.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, I felt it after seeing&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">you</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;duel with my son earlier... You must be at least a Dark Warrior…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Did you say Dark Warrior?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San tilted his head and looked at Biyeon. She shook her head, as she had also never heard this term. The Count nodded in understanding.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, the words you use are probably different from ours. It is a state where you can achieve great strength and speed while going through excruciating pain. The pain is as deep and opaque as the darkness, so we call warriors who attain this level Dark&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">W</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">arriors.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San then nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If so, then yes, I have overcome that step. I’m now adjusting to the next level of senses.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Essen widened his eyes in surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">he next step? Surely…?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s difficult to explain.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">More correctly</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, it’s very difficult to express through words. Maybe it makes more sense to say that you can see what you can’t see and feel what you can’t feel? I can show you with my body if you wish.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San answered while stroking his chin. They didn’t know what their level was in this world. He wanted to take this opportunity to gauge their strength.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I really want to see.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Count Essen said, his eyes shining. The sudden thought of being able to glimpse the next level passed his mind. However, the Count shook his head as he felt he was over</span><span style="font-weight: 400">estimating this traveler’s abilities</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Th</span><span style="font-weight: 400">e</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;man in front o</span><span style="font-weight: 400">f him&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">was very young.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;he even in his early 30s?</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">As far as he could recall, it would be an extreme case for someone even in the three major clans to reach the Awakened state by one’s early 30’s. The Hansung Clan’s grand genius, ‘Hanjung’, was said to have surpassed the Dark Warrior level and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">entered</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;the Awakened state at the age of 32.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘He’s probably at the end p</span><span style="font-weight: 400">art</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;of the Dark Warrior state,’ the Count concluded in his mind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Will you show a demonstration?” the C</span><span style="font-weight: 400">o</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">unt asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As San looked at Biyeon, his eyes fluttered at her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re so wicked…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Biyeon&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">muttered under her breath as she&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">rolled her eyes at San. However, she soon pulled out a sword from her waist. They never questioned each other’s intentions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They wouldn’t tire themselves out by bickering or questioning each other’s motives. The Count’s eyes widened wider. His son, Yekin, who was standing next to him, was also surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Is she at the same level, too?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Biyeon closed her eyes for a moment. Her energy gradually changed. Her torso, head, and limbs were wrapped in energy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">She went through the 1</span><span style="font-weight: 400">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, 2</span><span style="font-weight: 400">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, and 3</span><span style="font-weight: 400">rd</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">S</span><span style="font-weight: 400">tages of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400">cceleration without hesitation. There was no wind blowing in the square, but her hair started</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;flapping</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;behind her as if it was being blown by a strong breeze.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon, s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">he opened her eyes. She may not have been conscious of it herself, but the others in the square were able to see a pale light, like a halo, leaking out from her skin and revolving slowly around her body.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her gaze slowly swept past the crowd. Her eyes were able to detect infrared and ultraviolet rays.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;looked</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;infinitely clear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hu-uh-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Count narrowed his eyes. Yekin closed his eyes tightly. He couldn’t dare make eye contact.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When he tried to open his eyes, it felt like his eyes were burning. It was her energy and aura. Biyeon smiled and turned around. She slowly walked to a granite pillar behind her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With a sword in her right hand, she slashed at the pillar. Thousands of lights were sparkling on the tip of her sword as it was swung towards the pillar.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Shh-kit-kit-kit-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone was holding onto their breath. They didn’t hear the sound of metal hitting rock. All they heard was the sound like that of a bird’s brief cry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her sword was deeply embedded in the solid granite pillar. She then twirled the sword in a circular shape with little effort.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was like she was cutting into a soft fruit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tuk-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She took out a piece of granite. The piece of granite was in the shape of a cone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Reaching this state, it’s possible to do something like this.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">She smiled and handed the granite&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">cone</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to the Count.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Eh-um-”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Essen received the granite cone awkwardly. The hard granite’s surface was surprisingly smooth and still hot.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">His head was absent of any thought. The&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">show of force</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;had gone far beyond any prediction he could have made. However, he understood that he needed to treat these two differently… very differently.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh my… an Awakened</span><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Yekin groaned beside&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">the Count</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Count Essen was still staring at the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;two</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;intently. He foresaw a new fate unfolding before his eyes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Awakened were the core power of the Empire. They determine the order of the kingdoms. The rise and fall of clans were determined by their existence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The fact was…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">An ‘Awakened’ Warrior ensured a Count’s absolute rule. But there was not just one such person, but two currently in his territory.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San observed the Count’s expression with interest. He gained some clues about the level of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">their combat force</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">in relation</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;to this world</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Biyeon gently swept her chest and smoothed out her clothes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">She now understood that they were relatively strong. Fortunately, it seemed that one c</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ould</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;enjoy a high degree of freedom in this world if one had the ability.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It looks like we’re at a pretty&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">high</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;level?” muttered San silently.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Now all that’s needed is to get employed…” replied Biyeon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Episode 2. Book 1: Exploration – Chapter 7</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How long has it been!” muttered San under his breath. His eyes became moist.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“......”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Biyeon looked at a wall with her head slightly tilted. However, her gaze had no focus. She was just staring at a vague space. Her eyes were hot, and her jaw was tightly shut. In front of their wet gazes, a nicely decorated&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">palatial</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">room</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;spread out. It was about 100 square meters large.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The walls and ceiling were decorated with wood and the floor was made of granite. The furniture was made from luxurious orange fabric and high-quality wood, harmonizing beautifully.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Overall, the luxurious and warm interior oozed comfort and decadence. There was a balcony that overlooked a small garden below. The entire space gave off a feeling of freedom.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Anyway, it feels like we’re humans again. First, let’s unpack what we’ll immediately need first.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San took off his backpack and leaned it against a wall. He silently checked his equipment and began organizing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I can hardly remember when I felt this comfortable and cozy,” muttered Biyeon as she started unpacking her own luggage and placing items in suitable places.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘The Count mentioned that they’re people of great status, but their actions are very strange. His free movement and refined way of speakin</span><span style="font-weight: 400">g</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;clearly mean that he’s a noble, but…’ Yumia, their maid thought to herself as she saw the two unpacking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yumia</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was waiting to serve them. She was in her 50’s and was the most seasoned maid in the castle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind her were three other maids, awaiting orders with their heads bowed down. Their faces were&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">tense</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;because they received strict orders from the Count to take care of these honored guests.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, right now, Yumia was tilting her head, unable to understand what was going on. The maids were awaiting their orders, but they could only stand and look blankly at the guests. The guests were taking off their strange-looking backpacks and organizing their own luggage by hand.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the first time Yumia and the other maids faced this&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">kind of guest</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ll organize it. Please relax and make yourself comfortable</span><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Yumia</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;carefully said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh? Were you still here? We’ll do this on our own, so you can go ahead and do your own work,” San replied in a respectful tone, shaking his hand with a bright expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, Yumia forgot to</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;answer</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Even this seasoned woman couldn’t hide her embarrassed expression. No one spoke in honorifics to servants in this era.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To be spoken to in honorifics, especially from guests that even the Count seemed to be careful around… the maids started feeling nervousness and fear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please humble your words. It’s difficult for us to handle. The Count strictly commanded that we must take care of our esteemed guests. Serving our two esteemed guests is our job. I am afraid that we will be greatly reprimanded by the Countess if we do not serve you properly</span><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yumia replied fervently as if begging San and Biyeon to let them do their work.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San tilted his head for a moment and looked at Biyeon with a strange expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Biyeon</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;stopped organizing her luggage, raised her head, looked at Yumia, and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">then glanced back</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;at San.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">San</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;stopped organizing his luggage and started thinking about something.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Biyeon’s eyes sparkled as she awaited how San would respond and get himself out of this situation. She was curious about his response. Of course,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Biyeon’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;reason was different from Yumia’s…</span></p>
