 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San slowly got up. With his back now straightened, he looked at Yumia. There was a soft, comforting smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yumia lowered her head as she heard his quiet voice ring out within the room.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see… Then I’ll&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">speak to</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;you comfortably. Let me tell you what you need to do. First, there’s nothing that we need help with at the moment. Just wait for our call nearby. Second, we’ll be going out as soon as we’re finished organizing our stuff here. Rest comfortably until we come back. Finally, we don’t know the proper manners and etiquette&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">of this place</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;because we’re outsiders. We’re having dinner with the Count today, so I’d like you to teach us</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;proper</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;dining etiquette. You can describe this to us once we come back from our stroll outside. Is this fine?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes! We will do as esteemed guest direct</span><span style="font-weight: 400">s</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. We’ll be waiting in the next room. If there’s anything uncomfortable or something that we could be of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">service</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, please do not hesitate to ring the bell.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The expressions of Yumia and the three maids behind her quickly brightened before they stepped back. Once they left, San exhaled deeply.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Phew… this isn’t easy. It’ll take some time to get used to… It’s never easy to order civilians around,” he mumbled. He sat back down on the floor and continued organizing his luggage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Also…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Biyeon was speaking to herself when she suddenly stopped. He looked over towards her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Nothing. It’s just unfamiliar...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She shook her head gently.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“C’mon, don’t act like it’s uncomfortable…” he replied while smiling.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">As she unpacked, she glanced at San. As his name implied in Korean, he was as firm and dependable as a mountain.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400">No, he</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400">s like a mountain range.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">His inner self&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">seemed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;infinitely large, yet infinitely free.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">He kept a lot of things in and knew how to soften any situation. Though he may seem rough and rude around the edges, he never crossed&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;line. He would lead conversations, allowing&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">words</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to smoothly flow while keeping the spirit of the conversation alive.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Furthermore, his words transmitted a pleasant, lively feeling to others. He may lack book knowledge, but he more than made up for it with wisdom. Biyeon was not confident in that realm.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She honestly felt that she couldn’t measure up to him. Perhaps, it’s his leadership quality. He possessed the capacity as a leader. A natural leader…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A small smile hung around her mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Still, he was a bungling, accident-prone person. He was innocent and curious about everything.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">He was not afraid of new things, enjoyed small failures, and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">pulled out</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;answers seemingly out of thin air. In other words, he was a frequent ‘accident-maker’ and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">‘problem solver’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She was swept by his initiative and suffered some trouble trying to fix the problems he created. Nevertheless…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What if I didn’t&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">follow his lead and break out of my own shell</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">? If I had kept my head down in front of a book like before, acting ‘reasonably’… I may not have ever found and expressed my hidden side.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Surely, she herself wouldn’t have recreated all the pretenses and situations to unlock her potential.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">If it wasn’t for him,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">she</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;would have never seen such a breathtakingly fascinating and vivid world…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the afternoon of a bright, spring day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The temperature had risen to the point that it made people feel lazy. However, Count Essen was full of vigor, constantly speaking with hunters and warriors who flocked to his estate to join the hunt.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This large-scale hunting competition, held every spring by the various provinces, was a tradition of sorts for these northern provinces.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">This was because monsters crossed the Orom&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">M</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ountain&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">R</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ange and traveled southward for the past hundred years.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Monsters and beasts attacked once in the spring and once in autumn. They rushed out of the forest in droves, as if they were chased by something.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Not only did these beasts move agilely, but they also constantly changed where they rushed out from, making it difficult for the northern provinces to mobilize their armies to counteract the seasonal intrusions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">So, the provinces gathered hunting experts and warriors, organized hunting competitions, and distributed financial benefits.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Large swamps and forests spread over the vast northern area, extending all the way up to the Arctic. It was said that an uncountable number of creatures, monsters, and beasts lived in these northern environments.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Although it</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;was</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;a harshly cold region, active volcanoes and hot springs were scattered everywhere, and hot geothermal heat from underground hot springs heated the huge bedrock like a hot stone, allowing colorful and strange vegetation to not only survive but also thrive.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Periodically, collapsing glaciers created new swamplands, and volcanoes that constantly emitted&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">smoke</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;and vapors provided snowfall and heavy rains.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">So, this extremely unstable atmosphere made the area north of the Orom Mountains a place where heavy rains, fires, and thunderstorms always dominated.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The native people considered the north a sacred place that no&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">human</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;could go into and survive.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">At the edges of these rugged natural barriers, was the Count</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’s&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">estate and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">his</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;people, located at the foot of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">a</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;mountain</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. The Count’s estate had</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;held a hunting competition every year to defend against these incoming beasts, usually at a huge personal expense.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The spoils obtained through hunting were very expensive because of the type and number of monsters that appeared. The estate that held the hunting contest had the right to buy the spoils first, so it was actually a very profitable business all around.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, it was also a good event for the participants because the hunt’s participants could obtain&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">greater recognition</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, materials, and money.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If it wasn’t for the inevitable deaths and near-death situations…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San and Biyeon slowly looked around the castle. People from all over the world were wearing eclectic clothes and styles, so the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;two</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;didn’t stick out like a sore thumb.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the two people’s attire did catch the attention of some of the people&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">due to its</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;simplicity and style. It was Biyeon’s work. She once dreamed of becoming a fashion designer when she was younger.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their style considered the practicality and style of modern clothes, focusing mainly on comfortability and mobility, like wearing a T-shirt and jeans.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The waist was fitted with a specially modified leather belt using the original buckle they brought from their previous world. They also wore a jacket down to their waists.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">This style of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">dress</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was different from any other style experienced by the people here.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The material used for their outfits were soft inner beast skin for durability and warmth and tough Archon tendons for hardy threading.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their outfits also provided another level of defense, as the rough leather exterior wouldn’t allow most attacks to penetrate through. Outfits like these were precious and priceless. Unfortunately, the individuals wearing them didn’t think so…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They wandered around the castle with interest and curiosity.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To get the supplies they needed, they observed how deals were done and followed accordingly. They had received money in advance from the Count, so they had enough to make their purchases.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San and Biyeon didn’t know what this temporary job,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">which</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;the Count had just given them, entailed. Perhaps it had to do with the protection of this territory.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Regardless, f</span><span style="font-weight: 400">irst of</span><span style="font-weight: 400">f</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, they planned to dutifully provide the service the Count wanted. The main objective for the two was to secure a period of adaptation and to obtain the necessary information to plan for their future movement.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">For the time being, they needed to stick to their as</span><span style="font-weight: 400">sumed&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">roles and gather information.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm-”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The trading method is fun. Almost all the methods are mixed. There’s also quite a lot of different currencies. There’s really no difference in negotiating from our previous world. It’s just a bit tricky to check the money and slips for counterfeits. The way they pay taxes is also amazing…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’ll take a while to adapt to. The existence and relationships amongst slaves, merchants, workshops, warriors, and nobles are outside of our modern common sense. By the way, did you notice that more than half the people who are wandering here are slaves…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I noticed, too.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Biyeon looked around the square with a bitter face. A handful of people were dressed in splendor: nobles, hunters, and warriors.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On average, about two servant attendants were attached to the side of these splendidly dressed people. The slaves followed behind the servant attendants.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The slaves walked barefoot</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">wrapped their bodies in cheap cloth. They shuddered in the cold while carrying large loads of goods.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">They even saw some naked slaves. It was as if&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">some</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;weren’t even allowed to wear clothes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their foreheads were stamped with their master's seal, indicating their status as slaves and who they were owned by. Their hair was cut short so as not to cover their foreheads. There was no distinction between men and women slaves. They were all treated roughly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s still very… embarrassing and inhumane,”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">San</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;muttered. His mouth was tightly closed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It reminds me of the Greek era. A small number of citizens and a large number of slaves… If you look at the illustrations and pictures of that time, you can see that most of them were naked on the bottom. Well, having come here, I never imagined that cloth fabric would be so expensive. There’s no such thing as a clothing store, either,”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Biyeon stated.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San responded</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;with a bitter look, “The one who has cloth will make the slaves create their clothes, and those who don’t have slaves would make it themselves, so I guess there’s no need for a clothing store. A clothing business will be ruined with this type of economy.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">And… it’s not even</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;limited to clothes, is it? Ah, it all feels inhumane. Just thinking of our future here…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The Dong-Myung Clan warriors!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The p</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">eople near one of the castle’s entrances screamed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, the world-renowned Dong-Myung Clan. What kind of unique weapons will they show</span><span style="font-weight: 400">case</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;to the world this time?” stated a</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;resident</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;nearby</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;San and Biyeon</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was constant murmuring here and there. San</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;eyes shone brightly. Biyeon was also looking at the entrance of the castle gate with her mouth&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">firmly closed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. There were people coming into the castle that interested them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, they would be able to observe one of the three absolute clans. The Dong-Myung clan supplied th</span><span style="font-weight: 400">is</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;world</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;with</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">weaponry</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, as th</span><span style="font-weight: 400">e clan focused on</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;develop</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ing</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;weapo</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ns</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;and advancing new technology. With strange-looking weapons on their backs, the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;Dong-Myung clansmen</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;approached the main square, a large cart in tow…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Episode 2. Book 1: Exploration – Chapter 8</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What did you see?” asked San. His gaze was still on the cart.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No matter how I look at it… they look like guns,” she replied.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Interesting, very interesting.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San put his hands behind his back and cracked his knuckles.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“People say that they’re called Dong-Myung… First, I think we should find out what kind of group they are.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“An organization that deals with guns and various weaponry… By the way, that guy in the front seems pretty strong.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Their aura is fairly strong. Even from this distance,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">their aura is</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;starting to give me goosebumps.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">There were&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">12 warriors from the Dong-Myung Clan. They were coming through the gates, wearing clasps with their clan crests inscribed on them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They marched uniformly, exuding dignity and energy close to an armed ceremonial march.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San and Biyeon carefully looked around. People were respectfully cheering with expressions close to awe.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even if no one said anything, one could easily tell that the aura and weight of being one of the Absolute Clans were great.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Biyeon looked behind her. The sons and daughters of the nobles were also looking at the procession with envy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">People who appeared to be ordinary hunters were trying to avoid making eye contact with the Dong-Myung warriors.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Absolute Clans must have a great power.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Right. It makes me even more reluctant to make eye contact with them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s find out about them in detail later. Let’s go back for now.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two looked at the procession once more before turning away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the lead Dong-Myung clansman met eyes with San. It was a distance of more than 20 meters, but San froze.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;tilted his head from side to side and then turned back with Biyeon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Dong-Myung warrior in the lead slowed down for a moment. His eyes stared at San’s receding back.</span></p>
