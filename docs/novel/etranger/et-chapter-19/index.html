Along with the war going on in her body, there was another war going on in her mind. It was a war of wills. On one side was an addictive, drug-laden will while the other was a human will that wanted to maintain its human nature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the pain passed a certain threshold, her brain started sending signals to release ‘dopamine’ hormones to help calm her body. For a brief moment, the pain subsided. However, the dopamine hormones seemed to harmonize with the poison. Thus, the natural defensive mechanism of the body started to crumble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A true world of pain started opening up. A true hell of pain pushed her to the brink. She started rubbing and scratching her face on the floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nonetheless, her actions had no effect on alleviating her pain. Her face was being protected by a soft hand. She had to go through this pain under full consciousness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re doing well. Keep it up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She faintly heard San’s voice. She briefly opened her eyes. However, all she saw was a dot of light before it disappeared, the surroundings becoming completely black again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She couldn’t see anything even with her eyes open. The pain seemed to manifest into a cacophony of screams. It was too loud, nothing else could be heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, her consciousness was slowly awakening, and the world started to take shape. The parts of her body where the poison was incinerated became empty pockets of air. The emptiness was slowly being filled with ‘hope’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These little pockets of hope began to fill and slowly grow. Through her pain, she felt that she was developing and finding hope. Those pockets of hope would bring newfound power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter how much it hurt, no matter how sad she felt…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She remembered hearing these words of encouragement. She also recalled replying softly back. Both voices started melding into each other. Two cadences started vibrating together, creating a Fugue state, wherein her mind disassociated itself from her while part of her still remained in her mind. In the background, she could hear her favorite piece of classical music, Dona Nobis Pacem in B Minor, playing…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Holding her face with both hands, San started to release his worrying frown and perk his lips into a relieved smile. She stopped convulsing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed that she finally found her path. He had been so nervous that his palms were filled with sweat, along with the sweat and drool from her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Biyeon’s recovery took much longer than he expected. It probably meant that her pain was that much more intense. He would believe it if she said the pain lasted for a decade or two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">San had told Biyeon about what he had experienced, trusting that she could also go through the process. She had to put her life on the line, but the attempt was worth the consequences. She readily agreed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He glanced at her back. Her child-like breathing was beautiful to see.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘I wonder what she’s wishing for?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was now moving forward. She was awakening her newfound energy, burning off the poison, and forging her path ahead. The contaminated cells were rejuvenated into new cells and her normal cells advanced into super cells, rushing forward with Alpin poison antibodies in hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the pathways, from her head to her toes and from her left to right arm, were purified and reformed. Her blood circulation and nervous system were being reborn to properly handle the stresses of acceleration. She came to the stage that marked the end of her internal war. This first ‘escape’ continued on slowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ‘Acceleration’ that they experienced was the awakening of each individual’s hidden potential. This new state brought an increase in strength, agility, and healing capabilities. It also increased their ability to quickly produce antibodies. For San and Biyeon, the unexpected experience of contending against Alpin toxin would become a fortunate fate. Once they were able to overcome the poisonous toxin through acceleration, a new world would open.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like a cicada shedding its outer skin, the two would go on to call this experience ‘escape’. There was always a price to pay to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pain needed to be overcomed slowly and fully. Only those who had an unwavering sense of purpose, the willpower to not give up or compromise in the face of extreme pain, and the intellectual ability to see the truth coldly would be given this enormous bodily present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They didn’t know it now, but this escape foreshadowed the next, great stage. They would no longer feel pain up to the second stage of acceleration. The reward for something that no one had ever done would be that much greater.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their unthinkable experiment had never been done in the thousands of millennia that humans were summoned to this space. It was a path that only they had ever tread.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was why this odd matching was able to produce this first story of courage and wisdom. Through their unwavering trust in each other, a legendary tale began.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">***</span></p>

A corner of her mouth reactively went up. The ability to smell was probably an unconscious human behavior that signified life. It was also evidence that he was nearby. She had her eyes closed. She was awake, but she didn’t want to open her eyes just yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How much time has passed?” she asked with her eyes still closed. Her voice was soft yet firm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Three hours. It took a lot longer than I thought. Were you able to see the end?”</span></p>

She slightly opened her eyes. She was able to see his broad back as he was walking away. She had on a small smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Episode 1. Book 3: Escape – Chapter 3</span></p>

Close by, Biyeon was also looking around. They were scanning their surroundings atop trees that stood over 200 meters high.</span></p>

Whenever they didn’t have a mission, they went on reconnaissance missions to try and gather information on the surrounding terrain. They discovered a few caves in the mountains, but all of them led to dead ends.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, all the dead ends showed leftover matter that proved someone was there before them. The previous visitor’s despair and struggles were evident. The leftover matter also seemed to laugh at those who followed.</span></p>

Their minds were filled with the thought of escaping. After successfully reaching the second stage of acceleration, their eyesight increased severalfold, allowing them to scan this area known as ‘Pian’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From relatively high areas where they could see far away, they would gather together, share their findings, and discuss possible escape routes.</span></p>

It’s like my eyes have automatic zooming features. Also, the field of vision is relatively wide, unlike binoculars.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">San was appreciating his own developed body. He was especially surprised at his vision and zoom feature, which could zoom up to 20x. His field of vision narrowed, but he could still see far away details, as well as an eagle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His hearing had also dramatically improved. Although he couldn’t fully discern all the surrounding sounds, he was able to hear sounds from far away. Furthermore, this increased hearing capability gave him the ability to find out how far and fast things were moving based on the strength of the emitting sound waves. Biyeon mentioned that if the sound waves were getting closer together, the object was moving closer, if the object was moving farther away, the sound waves would be further apart. She said it was due to the ‘Doppler’ effect. He felt he heard about it once in his high school physics class.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regardless, with his improved hearing ability and Biyeon’s mathematical formula on how to calculate distance and speed, San was able to recognize the speed and directional movement of an object in real-time.</span></p>

Since their senses were different in this state, they needed to get used to it. Though they still felt numb and dizzy, they started off from the lower levels and worked themselves up, allowing them to enjoy adventures while controlling the varying levels of acceleration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Is this how drivers felt while driving speeds of over 300 km/hour on the Autobahn?</span></p>

It was an intelligent animal and was quite clever. It could even speak a few words of human speech. It seemed like the Hawk really liked these two humans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the days passed, it seemed to spend more time with San and Biyeon. It had grown friendly enough with them that it relayed some information about the surrounding terrain and also helped them escape from a few emergencies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Hawk was a little picky and self-centered, only speaking when it wanted to. Or, it could be that it could only speak what it was allowed to talk about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">San and Biyeon were somewhat concerned about the relationship between the Hawk and the people who placed them here, but they didn’t really push the issue. Wasn’t it a game where everything would unfold eventually? And…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s so cute!” This was San’s short and simple assessment.</span></p>

The missions kept coming in. The opponents were fiercer and stronger beasts. The two of them used every method, strategy, and resource available to counter the enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The missions didn’t end until they fulfilled the minimum requirements. The average mission had doubled or triple the minimum number of enemies they needed to kill. If the requirements were to kill three beasts, then they could kill three and then run away from the others until the mission time period expired. If they were able to kill more than the minimum, they would be rewarded for the extra kills. The reward was always more nectar.</span></p>

Do you remember seeing the message ‘enjoy death and pain’ on the pit wall? I feel like it has something to do with nectar. Or maybe it has something to do with ‘Acceleration’?”</span></p>
