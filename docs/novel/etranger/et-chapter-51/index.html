 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Before claiming your honor, know how to feel shame first! Every one of you deserved to die earlier.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Why are</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;you all still lying on the floor?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dong-Myung warriors quickly got up and gathered together after hearing&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;words and stood at attention to hear his orders.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">After that… the Dong-Myung warriors were all kneeling in front of San and Biyeon, asking what they should do.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With darkly bruised faces bowed down…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was as you said. Running around and working with the support staff really did&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">get him riled up</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">,” San said to Biyeon after assigning missions to the Dong-Myung warriors.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He’s a smart person. It doesn’t seem like he’s normal,” Biyeon muttered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He is an Awakened warrior after all.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He’s an Awakener that knows what’s good for him. He has both honor and a sense of responsibility. His brain is a lot better than the other smooth-brained warriors. In my judgment, he’s a competent commander.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you going to do now? It looks like we’ve gained his trust, just as we planned…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What else should we do? Let’s progress with our plans. We’ll&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">consider how to properly utilize him</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;after carrying out our plans here.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Complete darkness fell in the forest. A large fire was burning in the middle of the base camp square. Around the square, various devices and traps had been placed and installed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All of the hunters would be able to see this fire in the darkness of night, and it would also be the center of attention for all the beasts and monsters in the forest.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, it w</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ould</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;create the situation that San and Biyeon planned for.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm- I think&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">our</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;plans are complete now,” San muttered as he looked around the base camp.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It seems that these friends assigned to us are a little useful now.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">We seem to be</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;working quite well together?” Biyeon said, looking towards the support staff who were finally taking a brea</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ther</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. On one side, the smell of grilling Archon meat&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">hung in</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;the air.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The warriors were probably going to enjoy a fresh feast with stamina dishes made with the finest ingredients that even royal families c</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ould</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;only dream of eating. If the Count knew, he’d probably be jumping up and down…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yuren, Yeria, and Jahan!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, sir!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San called on the commanders of each company. Among them was the commander of the newly established</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Dong-Myung warriors company.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">San had asked them to act as an equal ‘company’, and Dongye readily agreed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, when conducting their hunting during the week, they would be allowed to hunt independently as Dong-Myung clan warriors.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The arrangement for the night border watch is…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The formation of the night patrol team is…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Communication lines and what to do are…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The area allocated to the returning hunters…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The classification and distribution of spoils…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The wounded should be…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">After meticulously laying out orders,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">San</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;turned to Yeria and asked,</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Has dinner been prepared?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tell everyone to get together. We’ll eat together.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From a distance, Dongye observed how they were leading the group. He then looked closely at defensive barriers and traps that they designed and built. His eyes sunk deeper and deeper in thought.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘They’re scarier&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">than I initially thought</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. It’s like… It’s like they’re not setting up a support headquarters but a sophisticated forward deployment base for operations and combat. Furthermore…&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;beasts were dismantled and skinned in advance to give off the smell of blood, and the fire was made large to inform the hunters of the base camp</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;location and direction. If so, what is their intention? Is this place going to be the main hunting ground? Are they actually attract</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ing all the beasts and monsters?</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye was reflecting on his own judgment. He partnered with them in order to ensure the safety of his clansmen.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Additionally, his sense of prestige and honor wouldn’t allow him to return empty-handed</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;from this hunting event</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Since the morning of the first day, when he encountered an unexpected number of high-level monsters, he was truly running in ‘survival</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">mode.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">This hunt was very different from previous years. Up to last year, the beasts in this region&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">consisted</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;of Algons, Alpins, and very rarely, Alchins.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">It would normally be seen as a great success if 3 to 4 Algons were caught with a 12 p</span><span style="font-weight: 400">erson group over the course of the entire hunting period</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even with all the hunters</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;spoils combined, it was difficult to catch more than ten Algons total. The rest were generally Alpins, tigers, and wild boars. In the morning, during their initial hunt, the Dong-Myung warriors sprayed bits and pieces of meat and fresh blood to lure the monsters in. It was the same tactic that they used in previous years. They had equipped their new weapons while awaiting the monsters.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, rather than the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">beasts and monsters they were expecting,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">it was a whopping 4 Algons that appeared in front of their bait. Unbelievably, the 4 Algons were being chased by 4 Archons… the Archons were behemoths among behemoths… they couldn’t be taken down by the simple bullets that they had prepared.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">In that battle alone, three warriors were lost.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;To make matters worse, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;giant crustacean with a mantis’&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">head chased</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;after the Archons. The wave of ever-stronger beasts drove him to despair.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">He had never even seen or heard of the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;crustacean-like monster&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">before</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. The crustacean-mantis monster grabbed an Archon and ate it whole.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In that gap, they ran like hell without much hope of living. That situation was probably about to unfold again right here, very soon…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘The problem is, those people knew about that monster, and the monster was afraid of those two...</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">'The fear exhibited by the crustacean-mantis creature&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">was</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;quite palpable.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment the crustacean beast saw those two, it</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;ran away like crazy. Furthermore, San and Biyeon both seemed to have transcended the initial Awakened Warrior stage...'</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dongye cracked his finger at this point. His fingertips were still visibly shaking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘The motion of moving in a straight line in the air and turning their body’s direction at a right angle is possible only for Han-Sung Clan masters who’ve reached the second-level of Awakening. In addition, San used the Dong-Myung clan’s electrified fist strike… the capacity of the electric shock was at least at the level of a third-degree user…</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The same was true of the woman’s rotational motion… in one motion, she folded her joints more than three times while turning on three separate axes. It was a move only second-level Awakeners of the Dong-Myung clan could pull off. In addition, the lights that sparkled at the tip of her sword before piercing the Archon’s skin…&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">he</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;c</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ouldn’t</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;even take a guess. Who the hell&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">we</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">re they? Why did they come here?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They seem to be gathering,” Biyeon said as she wiped her mouth with a handkerchief.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s good. Anyway, it’s best to get live battle experience. Besides, we get to earn money and build friendships with precious people. It’s a good situation all around, right?” San said to Yeria as he laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir?” Yeria asked while raising her head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It means our guests have come. Shouldn’t we prepare to greet them?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Episode 2. Book 1: Exploration – Chapter 17</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The bright light and smell of meat were essential parts of a feast. It was the same in the mountains. The first to arrive were the other hunters.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">As the day grew dark, the rules of hunting&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">changed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. The hunter becomes the hunted, and the hunted becomes the hunter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">As they wandered out of the forest, the hunters began to reveal their appearance. With such a big campfire, one was more inclined to feel safe at night. Furthermore, it was better for&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">everyone’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;survival to form a large group than to camp in individual small teams.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Some of the hunters appeared to have already fought, showcasing scars and ragged clothes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yuren and Jahan!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Biyeon called the company commanders.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Usher the incoming into their designated spaces.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Okay.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The incoming hunters were puzzled, but they dutifully followed as the support staff led them to designated areas within the base camp.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Though most had already eaten a dinner of lean meat and roasted grains, the smell of fatty meat wafting through the air made them hun</span><span style="font-weight: 400">gry</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;once more.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;Thus</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, they followed the support staff without</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;argument</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. In addition, some of t</span><span style="font-weight: 400">he</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;support staff members were Dong-Myung warriors, so there was no reason to argue or&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">quarrel</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Almost all of the teams that were hunting in the mountains flocked towards the visible fire. Nearly 700 people departed in the morning, but only 300 people, less than half, gathered in the square. Some of them appeared to be miserable and full of fear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Experienced hunters who knew how to evade monsters did not like these kinds of open squares. Strangely, though, today seemed to be an exception. Hunters were flocking to the square as if they had originally promised to do so. Perhaps what they experienced in the forest gave them a good reason to join up with others&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">regardless of</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;their qualms.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The support staff distributed meat to the hunters, requested something, and then led them to their designated areas. While carrying out their tasks, the support staff w</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ere</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;slowly realizing their captains’ plans.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, all of their sweat and labor in setting up and building various traps and contraptions started to make sense. Furthermore, this bunch of wild, unruly, and rude hunters was willing to take on their roles in this new mission as if it were their duty.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They even had expressions of appreciation…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hawk…? It looks like they’re here. Ah! Fuck…. What I wish doesn’t happen always seems to happen. Damn, they’re really just simpleminded bird brains. These assholes…” San muttered. His expression was bitter. His gaze was fixed on the forest ahead.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s a group attack. It’ll be more troublesome than I thought. The hunters who haven’t come yet must already be dead</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">” Biyeon replied while putting on her leather gloves.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why the hell is this happening?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400">his&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">must be</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;related to us</span><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">” San quietly said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve come up with several hypotheses, but I’m still not sure. At first, I thought it was possible that the experimenters were hunting extensively in the north to capture and replenish their supply of monsters and beasts that we killed when we escaped from the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Pi</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’an</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. The timing of monsters coming down from the north is roughly similar. But what’s bothering me…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah, all of the monsters and beasts were females. Even the crustacean-mantis monster… are you talking about that detail?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes. Also, they were all carrying offspring. Those three Archons, four Algons, all of them…” Biyeon clicked her tongue.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What if it’s not a coincidence? What could be the reason?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“To put it simply, the beasts would increase their population here. It’s not clear why they would want to breed here. There’s still too little information to analyze. Even one Archon is enough to consider an entire mountain as its domain, so it’s not by accident when they move down in groups. Their movement was created ‘artificially’. There seems to be a reason why they’re coming down and entering the human world… but it’s hard to guess what the exact reason is yet.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you think are the possibilities of this being related to us?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Remember what Nil and Null said?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">W</span><span style="font-weight: 400">e were very important samples</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">We also</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">overheard</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;stories about ‘clients’ purchasing the ‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400">summoned</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’. What if the ‘clients’ were the gods of this place an</span><span style="font-weight: 400">d</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;those same gods were using the summoned as priests? With the priests’ bodies as natural extensions, the gods would be able to collectors information and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">track</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;us down..."</span></p>
