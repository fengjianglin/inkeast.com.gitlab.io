 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What's going on?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The warrior who was following behind the lead clansman suddenly slowed down</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing… I felt a strange feeling from</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;someone</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. As if…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dongye, the lead Dong-Myung Clan warrior, tilted his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Did you recognize someone?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No… no. It must have been an illusion. Anyway, who’s supposed to meet us?” the 45-year-old 1</span><span style="font-weight: 400">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;level Awakened Warrior, Dongye, asked</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;before continuing his steps forward.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s Yekin, the second son of the Count. Oh, there he is.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In front of them, men, women, and servants dressed in fancy clothes came out to welcome them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Absolute Clans were a state-level force, so there wouldn’t be any nobles foolish enough to neglect properly welcoming&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">an Absolute Clan’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;representatives.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Welcome.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Essen greeted his guests. Next to him were the Countess and the Count’s sons and daughters, who were guiding the guests to their designated seats.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The guests were all supremely handsome and beautiful. H</span><span style="font-weight: 400">owever, everyone’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;eyes, which were mixed with fear and curiosity, lingered on&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">San and Biyeon</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you again for inviting us.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San raised his arms lightly to his chest. Bending her knees and gracefully bowing her head, Biyeon</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;conveyed her thanks</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s my honor, please enjoy the festivities…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Count’s expression was blank while greeting San. Actually, he looked a little perplexed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is it possible to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">look</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;so different so suddenly?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yekin and the other invited nobles were looking at the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;two foreigners</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;with their eyes wide open. They received a different type of shock from the one they experienced earlier in the day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San and Biyeon were wearing the clothing provided by the Count. Because it was a banquet hall, no cloaks were worn.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San comfortably wore a slightly reddish tunic as an outer garment and luxurious dark brown pants in the style of those who lived in the cold, rugged northern regions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Biyeon wore a flowing dress that reached the floor with a light blue clasp on her chest.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San’s facial hair was shaved, and his hair was cleanly cut, according to the customs here. Biyeon had neatly arranged her short hair, which barely reached her ears, with a simple pin. She also had on some light makeup.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San turned to Biyeon</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. A smile hung around his mouth. They were also amazed at each other’s transformation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">About two hours after returning to their lodging from their stroll around the castle, they prepared for the banquet</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. They</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;bat</span><span style="font-weight: 400">hed</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;and wash</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;with the help of the attendants.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">When they met each other again, they&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">were</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;speechless.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They had only seen each other in military dress or in their wild, blood and sweat-stained battlefield attire. In the mountains, on their way to this place, they had lived relatively dirty, carefree lives.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Now in civilization, their image of each other collaps</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;in an instant. The fact was, what they had seen from each other so far was the most ruined appearance in their lives…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘You’re really cute and pretty dressed up like that… Was there this side of you?’ San thought.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘He… he looks like a sophisticated nobleman!’ Biyeon thought at the same time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Count</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">s dinner was to be held as a banquet centered on the invited warriors and nobles. There was an elevated oval-shaped dining table, seating about 12 people, in the front of the hall. The dining table was arranged from side to side, facing the circular banquet hall in the center.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San and Biyeon were seated right next to the Countess. A little further away in front of them was the reserved seating the Dong-Myung clansmen, who were&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">headed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;by Dongye.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why is it empty in the middle of the hall?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San muttered while looking around the hall.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s probably a place to enjoy entertainment during our meal. See, there are musicians and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">entertainers</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;over there.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well… It’s a world without TV or the Internet, so I guess there’s no other form of entertainment. For the nobles, I presume this kind of banquet will be the most important entertainment of the season. As nobles, I guess they wouldn’t stoop to the level of playing courtyard games.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their guide took them to an open place where people were chatting freely with others. It seemed like a modern business cocktail party.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Refreshments were placed on round tables in several places. While waiting for the main banquet to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">start</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, the guests freely chatted and mingled amongst themselves. Greetings and introductions were made between strangers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Welcome Sir San,” someone happily called out while walking towards the two.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah! Prince Yekin.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San greeted Yekin with a smile. San’s gaze fell on the person next to Yekin.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is my wife, Gael.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh! May the full protection of your God dwell in your home! I hope your household always&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">enjoys</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;luck and fortune</span><span style="font-weight: 400">!</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400">o your beautiful wife!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San lightly grasped Gael’s fingertips and muttered. He stated exactly what he learned from the attendants, word for word…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“P</span><span style="font-weight: 400">fft</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">-”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oops- I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gael unintentionally burst into a small laugh and hastily apologized. Yekin also had a slightly reddened face while holding back his laughter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What's wrong?” San asked Biyeon with a confused face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The order of the words was correct. It was just…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Biyeon said, covering her mouth with her hand.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Just what?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It seemed like you were reading the Declaration of Independence.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yekin</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;took the initiative to</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;introduce San and Biyeon to the other esteemed guests. It was what the Count ordered, but it was also something he wanted to do.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was difficult to even meet one Awakener personally, let alone two. Thus, as he wasn’t familiar with their personalit</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ies</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">preferences</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, some misunderstandings and conflicts may arise if they were to appr</span><span style="font-weight: 400">oach the other guests</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. So,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Yekin</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;took the initiative to introduce the two to the other guests.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He recalled what happened earlier in the day. When he thought about what kind of predicament he put himself into, his back became cool.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If he had gone any further, he would have faced a crisis that would have overturned his life and possibly the fate of his family. Just because of petty greed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">fter arranging his thoughts, Yekin looked closely at the two.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I really can’t understand them. They’re definitely not ordinary. There’s moderation in their actions, and although they’re still a little awkward, they are well-trained in manners and following customs. Their learning ability is phenomenally fast as well. They seem familiar with social interacti</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ons</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, so it doesn’t make sense that they’ve lived secluded lives in the mountains! Even low-ranking aristocrats are frustrated about how they should act when they enter the banquet hall for the first time. Are they possibly royalty?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Uhm…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gael tapped the back of Yekin’s hand.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her eyes were fixed on Biyeon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The person named ‘Yeon’, isn’t she great?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, she is…” he responded dryly. ‘You didn’t see her blood-thirsty look earlier today, did you?’ he thought quietly to himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unfortunately, Gael didn’t see what happened earlier in the day. Instead, she was focused on a different side of Biyeon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Without any prejudice</span><span style="font-weight: 400">…’</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;Yekin tilted his head and looked over at Biyeon. He started to understand what his wife was&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">getting at</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Biyeon was chatting with the aristocratic men and warriors. Certainly, in this space, Biyeon was a unique existence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Aside from her martial prowess, her novel appearance caught&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">his</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;eye. It may be unreasonable to say that her face and appearance were the best, but there was something about her that caught one’s mind and imagination</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. It was</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;enough to say that her overall presence was charismatic and alluring.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although this was a rural estate, nobles enjoyed many opportunities to travel, so they were relatively worldly and sensitive to social trends. Furthermore, fashion trends were fairly universal and spread quickly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Biyeon</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’s current appearance</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;was far from any such contemporary fashion trend.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">he difference in her clothing style was immensely alluring and pleasing to the eye.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">If the difference was observed in another person,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">that person</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;may have been</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;seen as a</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;‘country-bumpkin’, but</span><span style="font-weight: 400">,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">c</span><span style="font-weight: 400">oming</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;from such a discerning person who&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">carried herself in such an elegant manner, he couldn’t help but admire her sense of style</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. This being the case, her choice of style was closer to being ‘chic’.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">In particular, she carried herself with dignity, strength, and intelligence. She</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">passed the point of ‘acting sophisticated’ to ‘being sophisticated’.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Biyeon was attracting a following without even knowing it herself. It</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;was</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;very difficult for anyone to put into words, but… in their eyes, she had ‘it’, making others attracted to her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her laughter was bright but not vulgar. Even though her hair was cut short, it looked elegant and natural on her slim oval-shaped face.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Every gesture and every step revealed a strange sense of dignity and style. In every one of her actions, a greater meaning seemed to come out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She opened her eyes clearly, looked at the other person, and listened intently. The way she responded was calm, never crossing a socially unacceptable line. While respecting another person’s opinion, she did not hesitate to express her own. Thus, conversing with her was interesting and fun. Yekin’s heart trembled and fluttered just thinking about her…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In short,</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘She makes one’s chest knot with charm and grace.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yekin suddenly nodded in agreement to his wife</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’s comment</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The Dong-Myung Clan warriors are entering.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">People murmured and look</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ed</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;at the warriors entering the banquet hall with envy. The Count greeted Dongye with the utmost courtesy. The Dong-Myung Clan was classified as a state-level organization along with the Han-Sung Clan and Ki-Jang&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">C</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">lan. The three clans were referred to as the Absolute Clans.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Th</span><span style="font-weight: 400">us</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, the weight of represent</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ing</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;the clan was</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;large</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. The mere presence of the Dong-Myung Clan was exerting an influence comparable to that of the Absolute Monarch in the northern&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">territories</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Additionally,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">each</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;clan member w</span><span style="font-weight: 400">as</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;treated as a noble wherever&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">he</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;went.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their pride and self-esteem were great. Furthermore, most of them had the ability and noble spirit to support their lofty status.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, their recognized might and the pride of being an absolute force could&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">make one</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;become too sentimental and complacent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If might or status was misused, it could be an excuse to rationalize an arbitrary opinion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It would trigger an immediate expectation when an unwanted beast entered its domain or when a potentially hostile force emerged, throwing those in power into the fire first.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dongye, who was entering the banquet hall, suddenly stood tall. He looked around the banquet hall. No one escaped his gaze.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One person… No, his gaze stopped and fixed on two people.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly, Biyeon stopped talking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San also slowly turned his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Episode 2. Book 1: Exploration – Chapter 9</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Like what happened in the market square earlier in the day, the hall suddenly fell silent. All conversations stopped and no one dared to move. People were looking at what they thought was the source.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gulp-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone swallowed their dry saliva with an audible gulp. The feeling of something wrapping around and squeezing one’s whole body, a pressure that overflow</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ed</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;like a crashing wave, and a feeling of breathlessness...&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">uch feelings were making their way throughout the hall.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">And… the strange feeling of trembling in the narrow space between&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">one’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;eyes. The pressure created such fear and palpitations that it made the guests want to vomit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">In a space of about 10 meters, all of that unnerving pressure cycled around, completely under Dongye</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’s control</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm-”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye tilted his head with his hands behind his back. It&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">seemed that&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">something was not working out as he had planned.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Pretty strong.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah, pretty strong.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dongye heard the two exchanging words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">But that was all. Dongye’s&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">expression slightly</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;distorted. Both the man and woman were staring at him with distant, bored eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Their expression seemed to say, ‘mildly interesting.' No,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">if he were to be</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;more honest, it was similar to them thinking ‘mildly interesting</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;while looking at a clown.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘There’s no reaction to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">my</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">E</span><span style="font-weight: 400">lectric&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">W</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ave&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">S</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">kill?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dongye looked at the people around him. Their bodies started flinching and spasming once he laid eyes on them. Some were even starting to convulse.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">They were the people on the periphery of the Electric Wave Skil</span><span style="font-weight: 400">l. The skill sent out electromagnetic pulse</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;waves toward the target, attacking one from within. Dongye started to feel a little bit silly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The intensity and sensitivity of his skill were clear from the surrounding people</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’s&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">reactions.</span></p>
