 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dongye introduced San and Biyeon to the other guests, four officers from different clans.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The high-ranking clan officers looked uncomfortable, but, seeing Dongye’s respectful treatment&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">toward San and Biyeon</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, they decided to</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;greet San and Biyeon as ‘equals.’ Since Dite said that they were strong people, the clan officers were interested to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">find out</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;who these people were.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, unlike</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;C</span><span style="font-weight: 400">hief&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Apostle</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;Dite, Biyeon was a</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;seemingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;approachable and ‘accessible’ woman, so they had no reason to not be receptive to her presence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Drunken hunters singing songs were heard everywhere in the square</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Sounds of</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;scuffles, arguments, and fights breaking out could also be heard in the general ruckus. However, these clashes had little force or momentum behind them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The overall atmosphere was rather jovial and comfortable. Since the goddess’&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Chief Apostle</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;was&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">present</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, there seemed to be a general sense among everyone that no danger&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">would suddenly appear from the forest</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dite tilted her head. Her neat and fine face was slightly scrunched as if she drank something sour. San and Biyeon's actions so far were outside her&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">expectations</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, not by a little, but a lot.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Throughout the evening,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">San and Biyeon occasionally nodded and listened to the officials’ stories, but mostly, they drank silently. It couldn’t be said that they had relaxed expressions, but that didn't mean they were nervous or angry. Regardless, the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ir actions seemed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;natural.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dite</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;probably didn’</span><span style="font-weight: 400">t</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;know that the two had a completely different way of conversing with each other while everyone else was speaking in this open space.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘They’re not nervous at all. Does this mean that they’re confident?’</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dite thought.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><span style="font-weight: 400">This bitch</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. She</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’s pretty and</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;she drinks well, too. Anyway, when will you start?] San said to Biyeon in their private communications channel.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[One moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">We shouldn’t</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;rush,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">right</span><span style="font-weight: 400">? The basis of negotiations is patience. The one who</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">s impatient is supposed to talk first.] Biyeon replied.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The atmosphere gradually rose as the liquor had gone a few rounds around the table.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">People who hate feeling uncomfortable exist everywhere in the world. The Jane Clan official, named Narim, who had become drunk and sloppy&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">from</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;alcohol, approached and spoke to Biyeon. He was a special warrior in his early 40’s.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Jane&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">C</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">lan was large enough to claim the next rung of clans after the three Absolute Clans.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">He probably thought that he was in luck for such a beauty&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;appear&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">before him</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, so he&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">had been biding his time</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to take a shot at her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Women warriors are rare… which clan are you from? You must be pretty good in martial arts to be assigned to the Count’s support squad, even if it is a smallish position</span><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">” Narim commented.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Biyeon glanced to her side and faced Narim. At first glance,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;face seemed to tense and harden for a moment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, I have the strength</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to protect myself. I haven’t joined nor am I affiliated with any clan,” she replied in a calm tone. The tail of her mouth slightly raised. She looked to the side again. Dongye was looking for the right time to intervene.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">What about San? He was in a&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">staring</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;contest with the ‘Hawk’ image that was next to Dite. He was smacking his lips. He was ready to risk his life on this trivial&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">staring</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;contest, so he wasn’t paying any attention to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Biyeon’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You didn’t attend a clan? Then what abilities did you learn and how?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, a warrior officer from the Gyung-</span><span style="font-weight: 400">M</span><span style="font-weight: 400">u&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">C</span><span style="font-weight: 400">lan asked. The Gyeong-</span><span style="font-weight: 400">M</span><span style="font-weight: 400">u&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">C</span><span style="font-weight: 400">lan was also a giant clan on the same level as the Jan</span><span style="font-weight: 400">e Clan</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have mastered the skill of hunting mainly. There were many dangerous beasts where I</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;previously lived</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, so I had to learn to live through hunting. Nothing about my background will be of great interest to you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, do you have any interest in learning martial arts in earnest? If you’re interested, I can arrange for you to study advanced studies at the Jane C</span><span style="font-weight: 400">la</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">n…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Narim took a chance. Biyeon looked at Dongye while holding back any answer. Dongye quickly noticed the meaning of Biyeon’s glance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Director Narim, that’s difficult. The Dong-Myung Clan has already started a dialogue with both captains.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The expressions of Narim and the other military clan officials changed subtly. If the Dong-Myung Clan had already started recruiting the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;two</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;then there was nothing they could do. The Dong-Myung Clan w</span><span style="font-weight: 400">as</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;one of the strongest clans in this world.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The other clan officials gave up cleanly. However, surprising things may happen to those who persevere.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm. Is there anything to teach them? If anything, they would probably be teaching your Dong-Myung clansmen…” Dite said as she smiled brightly and stared at Dongye while joining the conversation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;eyes were slightly raised as he asked back. If taken at face value, her words were an insult against the Dong-Myung Clan.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“As far as I know, I heard that there is no other warrior that is capable of teaching an Awakened person, that is, a person who has already risen to an Awakened Warrior level. The same is true inside Absolute Clans, I believe. Am I wrong?” Dite replied in a calm tone, looking at the two men and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">woman</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;with meaningful eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dite was a worldly person, and moreover, a person who could not tell lies. Her words were not to be taken lightly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye was at a los</span><span style="font-weight: 400">s</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;for words. Dite was right. An Awakened was Awakened,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">he or she</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;couldn’t be students within a clan.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be considered ludicrous</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;for</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;an Awakened t</span><span style="font-weight: 400">o teach</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;another Awakened. An Awakener’s unique abilities were as</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;diverse and different</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;as the Awakened in this world.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">An Awakener’s specialty was determined by what ability one awakens. There were so many ways to become&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">awakened</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;that it&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">was</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;almost infinite.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">So, an Awakener could not evaluate another Awakener. If one can’t evaluate the other, one can’t teach the other.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The only problem with attaining Awakening was that nearly 95% of those who tried to go down that path died or became disabled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">In the Awakening process of completely reorganizing one’s body and senses, if one couldn’t find one’s own so-called ‘way of awakening’, one would surely die.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;most common causes of death</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;were</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;the heart suddenly stopping or for the brain to stop functioning.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Absolute Clans in this era were a place where the secrets of clans could increase the survival rate of those who</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;went through the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Awaken</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ing process</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;by more than 10%, especially through their resources and accumulated knowledge.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dongye fell into thought, trying to understand where Biyeon and San’s Awakened powers originated from. Among all of the Awakened in the 3 Absolute Clans, there were less than 10 that could use more than two special abilities.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">They were specifically called the ‘Enlightened Awakened’ and were treated as the most important people in the clan, regardless of their position within the clan. It was because they were the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ones who knew’ the way of the body.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was no limit to the accumulation of abilities. Those who could use 5 or more abilities, were considered to have reached the ‘Legendary’ state.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘These two are surely Enlightened Awakened Warriors. I saw that they were able to use at least 3 abilities at the same time.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye, who had been immersed in thought</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">suddenly return</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to reality due to the rising voices around the table.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well… then is the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400">postle saying that these two support captains are Awakened Warriors?” Narim hesitatingly asked. Based on his common sense, the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Apostle</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’s words were surely a joke. However, he also knew that&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400">postles did not lie, as</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;they</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;were those who sought faith.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">So, he knew she wasn’t telling a lie. However, she could be joking. If she already knew what response San and Biyeon would have after hearing her joke, then her words wouldn’t be a lie but a continuation of casual conversation. Her actions could have been in consideration of the other party.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ho-ho… I think those two can answer directly, no? I am stating my opinion only. The forest is the space of the goddess. How can the Goddess of Hunting not know what happens in the forest? I think that Captain Dongye also agrees with my opinion?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dite looked at San and Biyeon with an&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">amused</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;expression before naturally turning her head to Dongye. A light smile was on her face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[This bastard&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Apostle</span><span style="font-weight: 400">! What is she doing?] San&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">screamed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;internally while grinding his teeth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Cunning bitch!] Biyeon fumed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">They did</span><span style="font-weight: 400">n’t</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;want to reveal their status like this.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">postle’s words are correct. Both of them have attained the Awakened status. I, Dongye, can guarantee it,” Dongye stated with a nod.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The military clan officers’ faces&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">became</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;distorted. Still, their eyes were full of disbelief. They probably thought that they were being made fun of.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I'm not&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">questioning&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Sir Dongye’s judgment, but I can’t believe it. No matter how old they are, they</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;can’t be past their</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;early 30’s. Besides, the lady is sure to be in her twenties. I know that ther</span><span style="font-weight: 400">e’</span><span style="font-weight: 400">s no one who has attained the Awakened level&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">by</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;that age, even in Absolute Clans,” Narim s</span><span style="font-weight: 400">tammered</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The others nodded in agreement. It was every warrior’s dream to reach the Awakened level.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Honestly, I can’t believe this. In addition,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m not</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;convinced</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">that such esteemed Awakeners would lower themselves&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">to be</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;employed as support staff for a Count</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">E</span><span style="font-weight: 400">state. Is there any evidence that they are Awakeners?” the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">officer</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;from the Kyung-</span><span style="font-weight: 400">M</span><span style="font-weight: 400">u&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">C</span><span style="font-weight: 400">lan&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">added on</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Like a warrior, his way of speaking was straightforward.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone’s eyes turned to Biyeon.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400">That young pretty woman was an Awakened Warrior?</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’ they all thought.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;It was a story that would even make a rat laugh.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Biyeon look</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ed</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;at San with a</span><span style="font-weight: 400">n askance</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;expression.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was difficult for her to judge what to do in this situation. Once again, she had to believe in his superhuman senses and socially suave ability.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San took his eyes off the Hawk. The Hawk tucked its tail and hid behind Dite. San and Biyeon’s eyes met. He tilted his head and looked around the table. He laughed out loud, revealing his pearly white teeth, and looked straight at Dite.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Surely, it’s not something that can be proven by just your words, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The atmosphere suddenly became cold, leaving everyone speechless as if their mouths had frozen over. Everyone stared at each other with blank faces.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Openly questioning</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">postle of a god was something that neither a king nor the head of an Absolute Clan would do.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His actions essentially meant that he would be willing to fight against a god. This time, Dite was visibly embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is the meaning of this?” she asked. Her words came out very cold.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;San</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;seemed to be challenging her divine authority.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Aren’t you in your twenties, too? Besides, aren’t you very strong? Therefore, the game should be fair. If you want to see something from us, what will you show us?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The nerve! Do you want to test the goddess?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, you sure don’t know how to listen, do you? Why is the goddess popping up when I’m talking about you? Then let me ask you another question, are you the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">embodiment of the</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;goddess of hunting?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s… no…” Dite&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">quietly</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;answered,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">gritting her teeth</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, let’s get the goddess part out of the equation. And let’s limit the conversation to only those who are not goddesses in your body. Let’s talk&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">as</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400">humans</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. That works, right? I hate those who jump around and say irresponsible things under the protection of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">others</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, the expressions of Dongye and the other military officers hardened.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">San</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;was alluding to them too. However, they dared not protest.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">San and Biyeon, who had already accelerated beyond the 3</span><span style="font-weight: 400">rd</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">S</span><span style="font-weight: 400">tage, had fluorescen</span><span style="font-weight: 400">t</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;auras emanating from their bodies. It was the sign of an Awakened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the same time, three low voices were ringing inside the ears of the clan officers. Because these people were of lower martial level, the message rang in their ears clearly. The voice was very low and sounded creepy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Behave naturally and comfortably! Also, I hope that what happens here will not be talked about outside. The anger of the goddess is scary.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[Please! Act naturally! And forget everything you’ve heard and seen here! We will definitely reward you. Of course, the return of those who forget is much larger and more beneficial than those who don</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’t</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[Let’s drink the remaining alcohol. You wouldn’t convey a story from a drinking party like a real truth later on, right? We</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’re just having fun and shooting the shit.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The four were sitting blankly. What was certain was that they were in the presence of other-worldly beings. A hazy energy field flowed around them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">At first glance, it was obvious</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;that the energy field was dangerous. It was already overwhelming enough that the officers wanted to vomit from the tingling feeling that covered their entire bodies. It seemed to pierce deeper, beyond their skin…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dite’s face became completely white.</span></p>
