 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir San, could you tell us more about where you came from?”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dongye asked San a question.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His question quickly caught everyone’s attention.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly, all the conversations stopped. The guests turned towards the two. The Count’s eyes sparkled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Captain Dongye is speaking in honorifics?’ His rapidly changing attitude towards San and Biyeon was hard to understand for anyone except the Count.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Their behavior towards each other, just a moment ago, was exposed to everyone, and because they were so&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">openly</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;observed, the change in Dongye’s attitude was seemingly incomprehensible.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Count didn’t understand what prompted Dongye’s psychological and attitude change, but the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">changed approach</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;seemed promising rather than contentious.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s a beautiful place. The four seasons are distinct, and the people are friendly and lively,” San grinned and answered simply. Since the other person was being polite, he’d be polite too.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh- Is there such a country in the north? The name of the country is…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I don’t think you’ll know even if I told you. Actually, I don’t even know where I am now. The two of us were suddenly swept away by a great wind and flung high into the air. Once we landed, we saw that we were isolated in the northern mountainous regions of the world. After suffering for several years in the wilderness, we finally got out. Fortunately, Count Essen values our skills, so we’re planning to stay here for a while under his employment.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh no… you’ve been through so much misery and hardship. Are all the people there as strong as you?” Dongye asked, stroking his chin. In his mind, a probable hypothesis was being formed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They are strong. They are also very wise,” San replied.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We’re also a very prideful people,” Biyeon added on.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You two must have been&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">important people</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;there,” Dongye said as he nodded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a natural judgment and conclusion based on his view of the world. If the person who made him feel such fear and powerlessness a moment before was considered weak… he would have a hard time living with that logic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">were</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. We were the owners of the country…” Biyeon muttered&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">in a low voice</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;as if reading a monologue from a script. She looked at San. They suddenly felt that pangs and sense of longing for their home.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">In the 21st century, individual citizens made&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">up a</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;democratic country, so it wasn’t really a lie that they were owners of a country. A country’s owners were&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">its citizens… at least, that’s what’s taught in schools throughout Korea…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wow- the King… royalty…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No wonder…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">People began to murmur as they looked at each other.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;face started relaxing into a content smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Episode 2. Book 1: Exploration – Chapter 10</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">After the meal, they stayed in the banquet hall. The entertainment&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">t</span><span style="font-weight: 400">roup</span><span style="font-weight: 400">es</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;that had been waiting outside began to come in.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The dining tables were removed. Light hors d’oeuvres and refreshments were being offered and enjoyed. On both sides of the hall, bands with various musical instruments took their places.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were quite a few types of flute-like instruments, trumpet-like brasses, guitar-like instruments, small drums, tambourines, and other strange percussion instruments. There were no piano or string instruments like a violin or cello.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Like any country in any era, a&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">clown/jester&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">with face paint was preparing to lead the banquet’s entertainment festivities.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Excuse me for a moment,” San respectfully said to the Count before walking outside. He felt the burning gazes of the other guests.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He wasn’t yet ready to live in a world where he garnered so much attention. Honestly, it was very burdensome.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, in order to properly obtain what they wanted to know, what they needed to know, and what they needed to prepare for, they had to go through this cumbersome period. Every second was an important information collecting moment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400">he banquet entertainment was not to his taste. Even when h</span><span style="font-weight: 400">e</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;watched TV on Earth, he watched the news more than anything else.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He stood on a balcony and looked up at the night sky. The evening spring breeze was moderately cool. It had been a long time since he drank alcohol. He felt like he was going with the flow of the natural atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He wanted to smoke, but he shook his head for fear of being treated as a real alien by the natives.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘A man who emits fire and smoke…. Would probably be seen as a monster…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He smiled broadly at the thought. Then he remembered what he left behind on Earth. The things he put off to a corner of his mind while trying to survive in a combative environment started rushing into his mind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The smell of human life, the evening wind, and the rising alcoholic spirit momentarily softened his firm determination, allowing a small gap to form in his well-guarded</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, self-imposed armor</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. His pent-up emotions started seeping through this small gap.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I really loved you, I love you still, and I will never stop longing for you in the future… my wife ‘Soo’. And my loving daughter ‘Young’…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hoo-”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">An image of Soo, and their shared memories, was still alive in his mind. As if it was yesterday, the tingling excitement of their shared experiences still didn’t subside. Her scent, her smile, and her voice were still vivid.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However… the more he tried to remember the details of those experiences, the fainter and hazier his memories became.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Instead, the silhouette of a person to who he was very accustomed started overlapping with Soo’s image. He shook his head. There were tears forming around his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Grabbing onto the balcony railing tightly, he felt a sense of tiredness in his hands. He suddenly became confused. He couldn’t find an answer. There was no clue on how to solve the problem of living here and surviving for an&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">un</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">certain future.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Getting out of this damn world seemed like a pipedream. It was hard enough just adapting to this place.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The foreign people, culture, the barely understandable language, uncomfortable and cumbersome systems of hierarchy, and unfamiliar rituals… His mind and body were exhausted, even though a day hadn’t yet passed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘This shabby human body… against an omnipotent enemy with divine powers… Can we really go back? I guess it’s possible to live here in hiding for the rest of our lives. However, will they just let us go like that?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He closed his eyes and breathed slowly. It was his habit when trying to calm himself down.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He focused on positive thinking, positive goals, flexible countermeasures, fast execution speed, uncompromising immersion… and the ‘never die' spirit and ambition that made all of that possible. His mood improved, matching his pleasantly drunken state.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Whatever... I’m going to go all the way. If I can’t avoid it, then I’ll enjoy it. It starts now. It’s just the beginning… They’ll find us eventually. There’s so much to prepare for the next war. It’s ‘guerilla warfare’ time. I have to prepare accordingly. I have to train and advance my body, too…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly, San turned his head. The familiar light of her eyes intertwined with his. She had come outside at some point. She smiled brightly as if she were drunk.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Biyeon turned her gaze and looked at the landscape. She was also uncomfortable with the atmosphere here. She must have also thought of her ‘home’…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San stepped back into the banquet hall. Seeing her made him feel good. There wasn’t a specific reason</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, b</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ut he felt that he should leave her alone right now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sometimes, people&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">needed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to be alone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Biyeon looked up at the night sky. Stars filled the sky. A gentle smile formed on Biyeon’s lips.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They knew each other well. They didn’t just understand each other’s thoughts, they knew them. It wasn’t simply knowing knowledge or information.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their bodies were interlinked. An echo of emotion would easily pass from one to the other. They knew how each felt, understood each other’s will, and shared in the excitement and subtle emotions of each other’s feelings. The other’s heartbeat was their own.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San and Biyeon didn’t expect this level of understanding and intimacy to be so shocking and beautiful. Their relationship was without pretense. They enjoyed the most honest state of communication and togetherness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was no reason not to accept their unfiltered relationship.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nevertheless…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They didn't know what kind of fate this simple ‘honest relationship’ would lead them to.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They were the first to reorganize themselves by overcoming the side effects of the mysterious nectar.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, they went beyond that. No one yet knew what would happen when Awakened beings fully ‘trusted’ each other. What did the 100% purity level of trust, constantly exchanging Awakened concepts and skills, and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">always</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;evolving</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;abilities</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;between t</span><span style="font-weight: 400">wo</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;Awakene</span><span style="font-weight: 400">rs</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;mean?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No one truly knew. Not even the beings who brought them into this space, or the ‘client’, or even the Master…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What was certain was that they had begun to understand some of the mighty races that lived on ‘faith’ as food. They achieved human awakening by overcoming the fake vitality symbolized by ‘nectar’ and the false beliefs represented by ‘salt’. Their fate and destiny lay in dominating those lesser beings and moving forward…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Someone once said that faith the size of a mustard seed can move mountains. That was a true story…” Biyeon muttered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The banquet was in full swing. San was watching how the banquet flowed with interest. It was awkward at first, but once he decided to enjoy it, he&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">took a</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;closer look. What kind of fun do humans in this era live for? It would be better to learn quickly what one needs to get used to.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The banquet MC was a clown/jester. It wasn’t easy to understand</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;at first</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, but it seemed the main source of entertainment, or ‘play’, revolved around simple games of mixing the opposite sexes together into couples or making the audience laugh by joking around.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Occasionally, the nobles would take penalty wine shots, which inspired greater excitement and laughs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The band was&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">sustaining and encouraging</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;the mood with bright music.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The nobles and warriors alternately danced with the other sex and enjoyed th</span><span style="font-weight: 400">emselves</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;by playing group games.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s fun…” Biyeon muttered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s fun?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The thought that a noble’s banquet is an official place where men and women can meet and enjoy time together.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“All young people are like that. Isn’t it the same in any era?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Can people here choose to marry if they like each other?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, wouldn’t it be difficult? Even in the world we lived in, I heard that love and marriage are a recent thing… Huh?” San paused and flinched.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“In this world, polygamy is common,” whispered Biyeon close to his ear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why do I feel like it suddenly got cold?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your heart rate increased by about 10%.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So... &nbsp;what?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well… you’ll probably live like normal here, too. But if something should happen…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If something should happen… what?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There’s nothing complicated, right? It’s like issuing multiple invoices.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Were you&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">thinking</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;of this the whole time on the balcony?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is… very… important.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San clicked his tongue and looked at Biyeon. It seemed that she was a little drunk.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was nothing to really worry about, as she lived with constant restraint on her mind, always keeping an eye on everything. She was also kind of acting cute in her own way.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even one is overwhelming!” San shouted while stepping away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I mean… No… Stop!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He forcibly stopped himself from blabbering on.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Is there someone other than you who I can entrust myself to?’ he murmured, just loud enough for Biyeon to hear.</span></p>
