 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She smiled and left.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye stared at her back, speechless. In less than five minutes, he magically returned from the throes of death to life. He took a deep breath. The aura and scent that she left behind were&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">now&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">deeply ingrained into his being.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His Awakened senses recognized that his body was already fully recovered. It just took time for his bones to fully heal and harden…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">He looked up at the sky. The s</span><span style="font-weight: 400">etting sun</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;dyed the sky red. It was a magnificent sight to behold.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Who are you two? People who have the water of life. People who can connect the way of life with their hands. Who are these young trailblazers who have already reached the Awakened Warrior level?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Episode 2. Book 1: Exploration – Chapter 16</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nightfall and darkness in the mountains c</span><span style="font-weight: 400">a</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">me quickly. The surroundings were already starting to get blanketed in darkness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ku-ooh-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ki-Ik-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an evening in the woods where one c</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ould</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;hear the cries of monsters everywhere.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">As darkness fell, the spring evening air was getting as cold as&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">that of</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;winter. In the mountain</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;basin, where the temperature was dropping&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">quicker</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, steam was coming out of the supporting staff members’ mouths and noses.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They were busy. They were so busy they didn’t have time to think. Their captains were constantly instructing and ordering them around, and all those instructions and orders had to be fulfilled in the right place and at the right time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">They worked ferociously like a storm. One’s responsibilities didn’t end once one finished</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;a task</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. They could never rest if their colleague’s work wasn’t finished. In their entire life, they had never had to move so breathlessly. The expressions of all the support staff were drained of life. Perhaps it was a tragic expression that only those who&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">went to the cusp of</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;death and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">came</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;back to life would have.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phew</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">- is this the end?” A support staff warrior named Baggin said as he sank down on the floor after laying the last stone down.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah,</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;we’ve finished piling the stones.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Another support staff warrior named Chewi was looking around while wiping the sweat endlessly flowing down her face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The group tasked with building barriers is still struggling.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Their work progress is still better than the Archon dismantling group. There’s little progress on that side. We’re done, so let’s take a breather and then go&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">help them out</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Baggin and Chewi took a short breather and then got up to assist another group. As they ran, their eyes constantly searched for the two captains. They felt a sense of nervousness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San was seen carrying a large log on his shoulder, while Biyeon was skinning an Archon with her hands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their sense of nervousness came from the way their bosses were working ‘naturally’.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Phew- I really can’t understand them…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m so nervous right now that I feel like I’m going to die…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Something that they couldn’t dare imagine with their ‘common sense’ was taking place here on a daily basis.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">As far as they knew and experienced as low-ranking warriors, the people of their captains’ status were beings who always gave instructions and enjoyed their own leisurely ‘play’.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;However, their</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;bosses were relentlessly instructing and giving feedback to their subordinates and, without exception,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">fulfilling their own share of duties</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Their previous bosses used their ‘fist’ to severely punish their subordinates according to their personal judgment, a common occurrence in this era.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">However, these captains of theirs were completely different. They always acted first. In particular, the more dangerous, dirty, and difficult the work, the quicker they were to do the work themselves first and show a ‘demonstration’.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;Furthermore, t</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">hey finished these demonstrations very quickly. They seemed to be faster than artisans who specialized in the field. In addition, the support staff had to quickly learn these new approaches and work right away by applying them in the field.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The speed of work was link</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ed</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;to further work</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. The work</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;was exhausting just to follow along.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And one more thing…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Their captains’ instructions were somewhat unclear. They always talked about goals, but how to achieve those goals was largely left to the judgment of the workers.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;support staff</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;was told who, until when, where, and what to do. However, the captains didn’t tell them why or how things should be done. The captains said that they had to figure it out for themselves.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;Regardless, the one thing they were certain about</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For the support staff, this method was uncomfortable, caused anxiety, and was extremely difficult. It was much more comfortable, safer, and easier to do what they had always done previously. They didn't know that it would be such a burden to have to ‘think’ and take ‘responsibility’.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, their captains’ strong abilities,</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">new organizational principles, and a general curiosity about&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">everything</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;were radically changing the crew’s attitude toward their bosses. Their attitude was moving toward ‘absolute’ and took actions with meaning based on a shared ‘creed’.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, these support staff members did not yet have the authority to judge right or wrong and did not have the social standing to gain information to judge 'morality' and 'efficacy' in the real world, so only their future bosses would probably know the consequences of these minor changes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They’re also very busy,” Yeonri said in a low voice while glancing to the right.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Shush! This person… be careful with what you say.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yeria raised her finger to her lips and gave a warning. However, there was a very subtle smile around both women’s lips.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Where they previously gazed, the Dong-Myung warriors were hard at work, positioning and setting up barriers after recovering from their injuries ‘again’.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">About 30 minutes ago…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dong-Myung warriors were leisurely lounging around, checking on their equipment and resting.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">However, after their leader, Dongye, recovered and got up from his bed, the atmosphere changed completely.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as Dongye got up, he looked around and found Biyeon. The first thing that entered his eyes was Biyeon working with the support staff with her sleeves rolled up.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Then his gaze turned toward the Dong-Myung clan members who were leisurely lounging together. They were gathered together</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;and</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;chatting comfortably.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dongye stood in place, constantly moving his head, looking at the two scenes with his mouth tightly closed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Jahan…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye called one of his senior warriors. Jahan was considered one of the rising stars within the clan.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;voice was clear but very low.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes? Ah! Captain, you’re up. Do you feel&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">bett</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">…?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jahan got up happily and tried to show his respects to Dongye. However, he couldn’t finish his sentence and tightly shut his mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye’s cool eyes were&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">warning him to not waste</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;words. Dongye took out a metal baton from his waist and was fiddling with it in both hands.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">He kept his gaze on his baton and muttered in a monotone voice</span><span style="font-weight: 400">,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is the pride of a warrior?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How should we protect the honor of our clan?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…??”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jahan stopped breathing.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;eyes rose up from&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">the baton and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">were right&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">staring right at</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;him. His voice was getting lower as he spoke.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;voice was as low as the dying evening breeze.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The other clansmen stopped talking. Now, everyone was standing up and looking at the two with nervous faces.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ask. Are you ‘very’ noble and special?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“After completing the clan’s apprenticeship, have you just abandoned the clan’s values of cooperation and dedication?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…!?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Dong-Myung warriors must be very noble. The likes of a countryside estate must not mean anything to you. Even the captains hired by this countryside Count are insignificant people to you. Do you really think so? Where did your words go? Now answer.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah… no… no!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jahan denied vehemently with his eyes wide open. Suddenly, a scary thought passed through his mind.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, goosebumps started popping up on his back. How did they just leisurely lounge in front of those ‘beings’?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If both San and Biyeon didn’t allow it, there was nothing</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;we</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;could do. Also, if they wanted, all of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">us</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;would have died quietly in this place.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The realization that this was still a hunting ground, with hunters disappearing and dying wordlessly even now, passed by Jahan’s mind. The fact was that they had already lost 3 compatriots to the Archon</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;just a few hours ago</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, in front of these ‘existences’, who lightly killed the three Archons as if they were rats… the image of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">the Dong-Myung clansmen</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;lounging around mindlessly clearly popped up in his mind.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly, his hands started tingling. A chill ran through his body.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Were&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">we</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;acting like stupid kittens in front of ferocious tigers?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Finally, once this thought popped into his mind, he started regretting his previous actions. Furthermore, their rest was not something that was ‘permitted’ but taken as a matter of ‘fact’ because of their preconceived notions of themselves and their place in society…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We were saved. What should we do in return? Everyone</span><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;answer.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye’s question rang in their ears. His voice&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">rang in their heads</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;louder and louder.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Definitely… I will have to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">pay it back</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;with my life.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The warriors answered slowly with difficulty. Their voices seemed forced and meek.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh! This is very… terrible and embarrassing.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dongye sighed for a long time. Soon his hand flew through the air.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Pak-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jahan’s body floated to the side and rolled a few times on the ground. His broken teeth protruded out of his mouth with blood freely spilling</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;out.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye moved towards the next warrior while shouting. The sound of his slaps reverberated throughout the forest. Embarrassingly for the clansmen, everyone in the forest w</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ould</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;hear and see what had just happened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So, this is how we repay our saviors? Is this your noble position?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Pak-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The next warrior</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;jaw turned and his body flipped in the air a few&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">times</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Dongye’s footsteps swiftly went to the next warrior without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The prestige of being a noble and the honor of being a Dong-Myung clansman amounts to only this!” Dongye shouted out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Pak-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A warrior was momentarily parallel to the ground before rolling head over heel on the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Today, with my hands, I will reap all of your honor and positions.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Pak-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The last warrior foamed at the mouth before falling backward.</span></p>
