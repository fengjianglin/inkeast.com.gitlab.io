The Master couldn’t go off and do something foolhardy like messing with the natural flow of order, especially since the being was such a lofty and omnipotent figure… So, what should be done? These two, San and Biyeon, were still alive… Though curious about these two, the Master decided to stay put for the time being.</span></p>

He cupped his hand underneath his chin, staring at his screens. After contemplating deeply for a while, he raised his hand and poked San’s image on the forehead and flicked Biyeon’s cheek.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do well.

He opened numerous other screens. Those screens detailed the other species and beings he had put into this experimental time-space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The screen showed a space that was filled with the scent of blood. The scene was filled with madness, pleasure, explosive power, and elevated consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘They’ve already reached 80% of the mutation, and there’s 10 pairs left.

He was grossly disfigured and plastered with blood. His non-functioning arm was hanging on his shoulder by a piece of skin. Blood was oozing out of every wound, small or large, on his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Next to him, Biyeon was touching her cheek. She was also in a dire physical state. A long and deep slash wound went across her chest. Blood was still dripping out. Even though she had her broken shin bones sticking out of her legs, she maintained her consciousness and dragged herself towards San.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My forehead suddenly started to hurt. What about you?” he asked with a large smile on his face. It was an oddly bright smile for having fought for a week straight without rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My cheeks are ticklish,” replied Biyeon with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their bright expressions clashed against the dire physical situation their bodies were in. Their eyes also seemed to be in constant contact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm, I wonder why these guys are so quiet. They should just hurry up and come. Is there any nectar left?” He took out a bottle containing a purplish liquid and called her over. Dragging one leg, she slowly made it to his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He lifted her leg onto his lap. With his remaining hand, he held onto her ankle. Biyeon grabbed her waist and flattened her back for stability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bite down hard! One, two, three!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the count of three he snapped her shin bone back into place. Biyeon then sprinkled some of the nectar that San handed over to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the nectar touched her broken bones. The shin bone started healing, bonding the previously separated bones together. It was like superglue. Once her bone bonded, she sprinkled some nectar on top of the wound. With bubbling noises and rising smoke, the wound quickly healed completely. Afterwards, new skin cells started to form on the surface, creating a new layer of skin that looked no different from the other parts of her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hold it in place with this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He handed her some string to set her leg. In about 30 minutes, she should be able to walk without any issues. After resolving her injuries, they worked on San’s arm. They moved fluidly and naturally, exemplifying that they had taken these actions many times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm- did this mission end? Regardless, we’re still alive. We’ve been pretty lucky, yeah?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of them smiled at each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Six months had passed. Nothing large changed in their daily lives, but change was coming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The upcoming change would be brought on partly by those who summoned them here, but the other part would come from their own plans…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At a certain point, San and Biyeon were able to feel and understand their ‘imprisoners’. Their senses had gone beyond some imaginary threshold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As time passed in this space, they felt an inner connection growing within themselves. As they continued battling for their lives and survived each mission, this inner connection became stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their strength and speed were also improving in leaps and bounds. With these increases in inner connectivity, they were able to convert this relatively dull life into something extraordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they were still at the beginning stage. They were concerned that using this inner connection skill actively would negatively interact with their autonomous nervous system, so they were still allowing the feeling to grow without looking too deeply into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once in a while, they could feel their imprisoners pat their head or poke them. Of course, it goes without saying that San and Biyeon never outwardly showed that they were able to feel these sensations. Their imprisoners had full control over this space, coming in and out of the space as they wished. Hence, San and Biyeon were able to read these small changes through their developed inner connectivity feeling every once in a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a relief that these imprisoners didn’t seem to peer into their pit. This also meant that these imprisoners probably considered whatever San and Biyeon did as useless, as they had total control over this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, San and Biyeon were advancing their preparation in earnest. They weren’t just a couple people who had a high level of tolerance for pain and misfortune. Moreover, they were not the type of people to roll over by having their fate taken over by others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, they were secretly and wisely advancing their preparation to one day escape from these imprisoners.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">***</span></p>

They were on a completely different level than the Algon.</span></p>

Their goal was to never die. Both of them pushed themselves to the limit to discover new ways of resolving their problems and to fully understand their developing skill sets.

The Hawk would also gain the Alchins’ attention from the air, reinforcing San and Biyeon’s action plan. The two successfully led the Alchins towards the traps they had set beforehand.</span></p>

It was a tremendously strong beast that was 15 meters tall, a head as large as a grown human, leathery skin that was so hard that it couldn’t be pierced easily, dazzling speed, and cleverness in its tactics.</span></p>

They used everything that they had: long horizontal spears, traps and netting, poison, and even long-range fire arrows. They sometimes spent whole days inside the well stored pit or on the tops of the large trees.</span></p>

He soaked a cloth with some alcoholic fruit beverage and started cleaning her wounds, from her feet all the way up to her stomach and chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no hesitation in his movements. He then flipped her over and proceeded to clean and disinfect her backside. Afterwards, he placed a leather blanket over her lower body and handed her the wet cloth. She flipped over and started cleaning her lower regions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He started gathering the soiled clothes and towels underneath the bed into a jar and dragged himself outside. He was able to stabilize his leg by tying it onto a plank of wood. However, whenever he walked, he would limp, with one of his arms swinging lifelessly next to him. Biyeon stared at his retreating back.</span></p>

In his hand was a broken bayonet blade.</span></p>

They seemed to be extremely sturdy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They approached a dead Archon and took out one of its bones. It took them a while to extract the bone, as the leathery skin was not easily cut by their blades. With the bone in her hands, Biyeon tilted her head in surprise. She had a sword in one hand and the Archon’s bone in the other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s really light.”</span></p>

She tried using a rock, but the rock just crumpled into pebbles and dust. She even tried burning the bone, but it didn’t even change color. To test out its flexibility and sturdiness, she started swinging the bone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bone was resilient with a good bit of elasticity. It was excellent material.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Idiots! You need to cut an Archon’s bones with Archon bones!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The both of them turned to the Hawk. Biyeon gave a smirk.</span></p>

They started whittling and shaping the bone on the Archon’s teeth. Luckily, this processing technique worked well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though it was organic bone, the hardness and strength of the material was more like modern metal. They were even able to create a sharp point that didn’t seem like it would dull or break under use.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Additionally, using this processing method, they were able to make precision carvings and shapes, allowing for more detailed handiwork.</span></p>
