 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking deep&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">breaths</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, the clansmen from Dong-Myung stood dumbfounded and at a loss for words in front of the support staff</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. However, both sides</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;weren’t able to help each other in any way.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Every one</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;of them had horrified expressions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They were already past the stage of being able to fight back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grr-rr-rr-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the forest, the monster that was chasing the Dong-Myung clansmen reared its head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a crustacean-like monster with a head size of more than 2 meters and a length of almost 20 meters. The monster bobbed its head up and down. It had ten legs that seemed&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">like</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;they were forged blades, had thorns all over its body, and had long, countless tentacles flapping around.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh- that crustacean-mantis thing is here too?” San muttered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is- the level of monsters is so different from the information&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">we’ve received</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. This isn’t what these hunters can hunt. That’s weird. Also, these monsters don’t travel in groups...” replied Biyeon calmly while looking a</span><span style="font-weight: 400">t the monster</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San glanced around and slowly turned towards the support staff. His movements were relaxed. It wasn’t the normal attitude of a person who was tensely facing monsters in front of him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">From</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;where he was standing, piles of stone, previously collected by the crew, were piled up like a tower. Next to these stone towers were several pointed tip javelins cut from wood. They were lined in a row&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">as if</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;part of a fence. The other end of the javelins had handles like a cane.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Biyeon kept her eyes ahead. Focusing on the monsters, she stroked her white sword…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“2</span><span style="font-weight: 400">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Company Commander! Forward!” San calmly ordered Yeria.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“......?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Hey! Are you</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;deaf?” he shout</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;in annoyance while glancing at the center of the base.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes… yes, sir!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeria stumbled out and moved towards San. The warriors and support staff stared blankly at the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ir captains</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;as if suddenly awakened from their state of horror. The situation seemed surreal.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">An Archon lingered around in front of them, lowering its body and tensing its muscles. As if she was trying to strike a conversation with it,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Biyeon</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;walk</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ed</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;slowly towards the Archon. As&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">she</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;got closer, the Archon exploded forward.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even in this seemingly precarious situation…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Right in front of this violent scene, San turned to the support staff members and instructed them on something seemingly trivial. The overlapping images of violence over his shoulder and his calm demeanor were surreal for the s</span><span style="font-weight: 400">upport staff members</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The support staff members were feeling an unrealistic sense of incongruity and confusion. Did their captains finally lose it?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“A lot of Dong-Myung warriors were injured. Did you see their injuries?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes…” replied&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">weakly</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Organize your company to treat the injured Dong-Myung warriors with the medicine we prepared earlier. Everyone knows how to administer first aid, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes? Oh… yes…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do it now!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah… uh… but?... Yes, sir,” she responded while sweating profusely. Strangely, she felt like she had to follow her orders even in the midst of this chaotic, surreal mess. Suddenly, Yeria, who was still filled with terror, opened her eyes wide at the scene unfolding behind San.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Shh-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ke-Ek-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tuk-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thud-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yeria suddenly closed her mouth with her eyes wide open.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gulp-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The support staff and the Dong-Myung warriors all opened their mouths. They kept blinking their eyes as i</span><span style="font-weight: 400">f</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;trying to refresh what they were seeing. They were&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">trying to make sense of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">what they just saw. In front of them, the head of a large Archon was cleanly cut, rolling past a large rock.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The 15-meter-long body of the giant monster slowly collaps</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to its side.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A woman dressed in simple clothes stood tall atop the Archon’s crumbled body and waited for the next monster’s attack. With a mischievous gaze, she fixed her eyes on the next Archon while slowly rubbing the bloodied sword against the fallen Archon’s skin…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! Hey… stop that. That Archon’s skin is expensive. Why are you dirtying it like that…”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">San</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;muttered, without turning his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There’s too many of them, so I don’t have time to be considerate!” she yelled while taking a seat atop the fallen beast.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dong-Myung warriors stared at the scene, forgetting about their injuries and pain. Though they had their eyes open and</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;observed the previous scene</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, they weren't able to see her movements.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Like an arrow being released from a fully pulled bow, she had jumped 10 meters into the air. With that leap forward, she was able to put her left hand on the head of the first incoming Archon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She then bent her left arm inward and inserted her sword into the soft part of the Archon’s chin with her right hand. Like a gymnast on the uneven bars, she then swung her body towards the top of the Archon and made a full revolution with the sword.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her movements were as&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">graceful</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;as a flying swallow and surprisingly elegant. Her finishing action was done simply. The Archon’s head, which was cleanly detached from her 'revolution' around its head, separated from its body and fell to the ground before rolling past a rock.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One of the most horrifying and destructive beasts known to the people of this world had collapsed without as much as a whimper.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Awakened Warrior, Dongye,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">was left speechless</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. The Archon was a tricky monster with tough leathery skin, amazing regeneration</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;ability</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, and nearly unbreakab</span><span style="font-weight: 400">le</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;hard bones. Perhaps, if there were two or more high-ranking warriors working together, they may be able to kill one. But to be done this neatly? Alone?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“1</span><span style="font-weight: 400">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;Company Commander,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">come&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">front and center!” San’s relaxed voice rang out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, sir!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuren shouted and jumped right out. His expression was surprisingly bright. The atmosphere&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">within the camp</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;changed like magic. Their instincts were more honest than their hearts.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">They were acting like people who had been promised hope from their despair. Their fearful trembling had not yet subsided, but they now had the wherewithal to move around as their consciousness returned. They found someone they c</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ould</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;lean on.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San glanced at Yuren and turned his gaze to the right.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">There were</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;four Algons intently watching the people inside the base and slowly making their way towards them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The smell of blood stimulated their instincts to hunt, but the presence of the Archons, monsters at the top of the food chain, had held them back.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San picked up a javelin. He tapped the pointed end once on the ground and then looked at Yuren.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, since the enemies have come to us, you guys will need to carry your own weight now, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Look carefully…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San held the javelin in his right hand, stretched out his left foot, leaned back, and threw the javelin towards an Algon. He targeted the forwardmost Algon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Kwa-ang-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The javelin tore through the air with a sharp sound, as if the atmosphere was tearing. It went through the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Algon’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;neck before it could scream. The Algon rolled over and over on the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The wooden handle on the back of the javelin was deeply embedded in its neck.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San picked up another javelin. The remaining three Algons noticed his intentions and were starting to charge. Their behavior was like those of a hyena.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They were cunning and clever. They split into different directions and approached San from varying directions. But…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thump-&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thud-&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Plunk-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Subtle expressions started spreading on the support staffs’ faces. All of the Algons were struggling and squirming on the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">They were buried into the ground with the handle-side of the javelin deeply embedded on one of their legs or other appendages. The javelins were buried so deep into the ground that they couldn’t move their l</span><span style="font-weight: 400">imbs freely</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. They were also pushed into the shallow trenches from the momentum of the javelin. The trenches had been filled with various vines, which started to entangle around the flailing Algons. The Algon’s were totally restrained.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It's the sadness of those who move on two feet. There’s nothing one can do with just one&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">leg or arm</span><span style="font-weight: 400">…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San mumbled to himself. He then stared at Yuren.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you doing? Are you watching a show?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go on and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">kill</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">them</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Their</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;leather is expensive, so be careful when skinning the Algons. Also, restore the trenches to their original state… go!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes! Yes, sir!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yuren ran with his sword while still in a shocked, lightheaded state. The support staff members also ran towards the trapped Algons with their weapons.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San narrowed his eyes, looked at the forest, and slowly turned his back. There didn’t seem to be any danger from behind for the time being.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In front, the second Archon was just ending its splendid, dominating presence in a 'miserable' fashion. Biyeon felt a fiery feeling on her back as if someone was glaring at her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Dang it… I told you to be careful with it… they’re expensive products…” San mumbled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Episode 2. Book 1: Exploration – Chapter 15</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hoo-hook-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Biyeon took quick but deep&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">breaths</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her palms felt as if they were burnt.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Archons took a lot of effort to catch.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even in the 3rd&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400">cceleration state, she had to squeeze out all her power to pierce&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">their</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;leathery&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">skin</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. The quickest way to kill an Archon was to slash its relatively weaker neck and then rotate the blade around the neck, beheading the monster.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The first one was done fairly neatly. However, the second one took quite a while.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because it saw one of its own&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">perish</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, the second Archon moved around cleverly. It constantly swung its front paws, with long, sharp claws, like a sickle, not allowing Biyeon to easily approach its neck.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The swinging paws were powerful enough to threaten Biyeon, so her preferred attack was hard to come by.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thanks to this, Biyeon separated both of its forelimbs and ripped its chest vertically. She dragged all of its organs out and finally cut into its heart, ending the beast’s life.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly, San stepped forward. Biyeon immediately stepped back and withdrew. It was as if the two had made a prior plan. They had now changed positions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Take a break. We need to save our energy to catch that troublesome crustacean-mantis later, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San walked toward the third Archon with his sword drawn. The last Archon clearly observed the first two Archons attack in vain. One was beheaded and the other disemboweled. It tilted its head and fidgeted. Its instinct was sending a constant warning to its body.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The little creature that was approaching it was a much more terrifying creature than the one before. It realized that its position was no longer one of a hunter but as&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">hunted</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Its instincts were screaming for it to run away…</span></p>
