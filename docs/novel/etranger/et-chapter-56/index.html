 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Episode 2. Book 2: Planning – Chapter 2</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dite calmed her ragged breath. Her slightly frowned eyes were starting to fill with suspicion. In addition, her mind was bombarded with emotions of embarrassment and anger.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Dirty humans!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dite couldn’t believe what was happening to herself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The channels connecting her to the goddess were breaking down, and all the channels were forcibly ‘replaced’ with white noise. The power given to her by the goddess was also weakening, and her physical ‘body’ was also weakening</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. She was</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;like a puppet that had its strings cut.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She lacked control over her own mouth, making her unable to speak as she wished. Her tongue felt twisted and sluggish as if she was drunk. No meaningful words could be voiced.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[If you try anything, you’ll die. Your splendid life will end here.] San’s ‘will’ was conveyed in what was originally the goddess’ channel.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Are you ready for a serious conversation now?] Biyeon’s words, like that of the goddess’ when she communicated orders, came in thunderously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[How do you know how to use&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">god’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;communication channel?] Dite screamed within the channel. In one part of her brain, the Goddess Diana’s ‘will’ struggled belatedly to retake control over her&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">postle and the communication channel, but Dite sensed that she was growing farther away from the goddess.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dite felt goosebumps form all over her body. Underneath her waist, she even felt a slight release of her bladder. She was struck with utter fear. This was&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;first time she felt exposed and powerless since&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">she became</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;the goddess’&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400">postle.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Dite looked at her opponents, her eyes sinking in</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;and becoming dark</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">San and Biyeon</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;were staring at her silently.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The other two wanted a real ‘human’ conversation. Also, they were directly demonstrating that they had the ability to forcefully carry out their ‘will’.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Dite looked inside herself meticulously. One was controlling her five senses while the other was controlling her connection to Goddess Diana.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, one was generating&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">control over</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Dite’s body while the other was supporting that effort. In short, Dite’s own body wasn’t moving of her own free will. The degree of their synchronization was delicately interlocked, like a single person’s ‘will’.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San and Biyeon’s collaborative effort</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;was still somewhat clumsy and weak, but… it was essentially the exact method used by the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400">gods</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[There’s a lot we want to know.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">O</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ur lives in this world&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">are</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;always filled with dangers.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">This</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;means we have nothing more to lose. Thus,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">w</span><span style="font-weight: 400">e’re prepared to choose our own destiny. So, if you want us to do something, the option to choose l</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ies</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;with us. Do you agree?] Biyeon expressed her will.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dite nodded. At almost the same time, both of the restricting energies were quickly re</span><span style="font-weight: 400">leased</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Dite felt her head clear. Diana’s ‘will’ was quickly bolstering her physical and mental functions once again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[You both are exceptional. I heard that you were the ones that caused chaos in the Pian, but I didn’t expect your skills and abilities to be developed to this extent. The information I heard was lacking. Extremely lacking.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dite</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;immediately restored her expression and laughed weakly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two people in front of her were waiting for a conversation with their eyes wide open as if nothing had happened previously. Dite’s eyes shone brightly in response.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two had abandoned all of their precautionary actions and barriers. What were they so sure of?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">She,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">no the</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;goddess, admired these ‘humans.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Their purity of trust came from a deep respect for each other. It was&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;perfect harmony&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">of</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;trust and respect, just like the relationship between God and an&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">postle!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really… you both are&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">scary</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why don’t you stop talking like&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">you're</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;speaking to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">one of your</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;audiences and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">take care of</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;our surroundings first?” Biyeon said as she smiled and pointed at the people around the table. Eight eyes were looking at&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">them</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;without knowing what was going on. Dite, now the embodiment of Goddess Diana, nodded. The eyes of the three officers lost focus.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">They w</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ould</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;see and hear nothing now. They wo</span><span style="font-weight: 400">uldn</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’t be able to remember what happened before either. Dongye stroked his chin and</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">look</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;at the three.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This fellow is already Awakened. I can’t help it</span><span style="font-weight: 400">,”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;Dite said before turning to Dongye.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400">If you wish and if the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">se two</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;allow it, you can be an observer of our conversation</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">” Her expression was very solemn.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Biyeon’s eyes shone colorfully as she awaited Dongye’s response.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m willing to be an observer,” Dongye answered with a nod. He wanted to know everything. There were many things he wanted to know, so there was no reason to refuse.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What you hear now should not be told to anyone, directly or indirectly. Are you willing to make a pledge?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will. I will risk my name, honor, and life.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“In the name of Goddess Diana, the oath has been made. Now, shall we have a serious conversation? You two ask one question and then I ask one. Would that be fair and acceptable?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is it the gods who are chasing us now?” San asked straightforwardly. It was the most pressing question, to know who their enemy was.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not like that. You are already Awakened. Because an Awakened being believes in oneself, it is useless for a god to pursue an Awakener’s faith as food,”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Dite</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;responded briefly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Was it the nectar that awakened you? Or did you awaken in your own way?” asked Dite this time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can say both. Thanks to the nectar’s regenerative power, we were able to try everything, even in situations that were life-threatening,” replied Biyeon. She then asked,</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are we being chased right now? If so, who is after us?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don't know the answer to that. However, it is certain that you&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">are very</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;famous&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">existences</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;who&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">are</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;closely followed by all the transcendent beings of this world.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">You</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;can be assured that the very mighty beings, including gods, care about your state of affairs and movements. For thousands of years since the spread of nectar, no humans have brought such shocking results as you both have,” replied Dite while giggling. Now it was her turn to ask a question.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“When was the Awakening achieved? And when did the second stage of awakening pass?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What state does Awakening mean? It took so many steps.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“To escape from darkness. The level after ‘Dark Warrior’? Beyond the stage where the pain disappears. That would be the Awakened level. The second stage would mean the next step above that. A whole new sense would have opened up in the second stage.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well… reaching the Awakened stage didn’t happen until 9 months since we came to this world. The next step, or second stage, was after we escaped what you call Pian. About a few months ago? It’s pretty tricky to know for sure. We’re also still trying to get used to this second stage…” San answered this time. His expression was dull as if he found these questions uninteresting.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dite hardened her expression. Dongye was also looking at them with his mouth open. However, the reasons why the two were surprised were slightly different.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘They’ve reached the 4</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;Stage of Acceleration, then that means they’ve reached the second stage as Awakeners… but how are they able to ‘talk with the world’? Dite,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">who was currently under the control of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">G</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">oddess Diana, thought.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Come to this world? Awakened in only 9 months, and now they’ve entered the second stage? Are you kidding me? Even 10 years wouldn’t be enough time. And, isn’t it weird? They’re giving respect to the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400">postle and the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400">postle is giving equal respect to them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;T</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">hey’re speaking to each other so naturally. Who are these guys…?” Dongye thought.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dite and Dongye were both frowning.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">They had a common expression of bewilderment as&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">if they</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;were being beaten by a stick made up of their own common sense, destroying their own logic</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;and worldview</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. The lack of reality made them lose their words&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">more than</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;feel surprised.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, it was difficult to deny the reality because they directly experienced the two’s powers with their own bodies.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The clever&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">G</span><span style="font-weight: 400">oddess of Hunting could now guess the reason why the fearsome beings of this universe, the Master and Dragon, paid special attention to these two.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">These two may possess the ‘key’ to clarify the mechanism of ‘Awakening.’</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even the almighty ‘Creator’ was said to have referred to the key when creating humans… In addition, these two may provide clues to how the gods could overcome the power of Sages and Awakeners to rebuild their faith among the humans and other beings within this universe.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s get to the main point. What do you want from us?” Biyeon asked with a light smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why do you think we want something? Would it be hard to believe that we were just curious?” Dite pursed her lips and asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“As I talk with you, various circumstances&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">have now become resolved in my mind</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. We&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">thought</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;i</span><span style="font-weight: 400">t</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;was abnormal how calm and peaceful it was for us when we entered the forest. Since the Goddess of Hunting is said to be in charge of the forest, we should assume that you already knew of us when we moved through the forest, right? We had plenty of prey to hunt so long as we followed a set path that you created. Are we right&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">up to here</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please continue,” Dite said as she nodded with an interested expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And you must have led us to Count Essen’s estate. The hunting festival is held there. It would provide us with an environment where we can blend in naturally with others. And then you exposed us to your priests. You made them state fraudulent remarks of heroes sent by the gods. However, it is said that gods live on faith, so gods cannot tell lies… if so, the prepared remarks by the gods must have been true and consensual amongst the gods. Are we right&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">up to here</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amazing! Please continue…” Dite was nervous now. Such wisdom! Biyeon’s conjecture continued,</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I think the balance of the forest is going to break. After a little more time, the balance of the land where humans live will also be broken. Right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why do you think so?” Dite squinted and asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“All the beasts we hunted today, even the deadliest ones, were all female. All of them were hungry and flocking to this region for more than food. They were all carrying their offspring within their bellies as well. That’s definitely not natural. Then someone’s ‘will’ was imposed upon them to migrate. It doesn’t seem like the Goddess of Hunting would do something like this and break the delicate balance of nature, especially if it means losing your faithful followers. Shall I continue?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…” Dite was moving her lips, but no words came out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who is it? Who’s sending the northern monsters down, especially in such an organized fashion? And why?” Biyeon&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">asked</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. However, Dite was staring at her without saying a word in response.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm… that means the two black Hawks we killed earlier were sent by the being who's controlling the beasts from the north. That’s why you were present during the attack, positioning yourself in the center. You wanted us to take care of the Hawks while you observed. I thought it was weird,” said San.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Phew- You two are too surprising. Even amid the chaos of battle and within this short amount of time, you’ve already understood the gist of what’s going on! You both are correct. Your conjectures are almost exactly correct. I’ve fallen into a difficult situation, as well as the other gods.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So, what do you want from us?” asked San again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Existences like us possess strong power. However, we lack the vessels to carry out our powers in the physical world. As we lack physical power, we’re not able to gain human faith and expand our powers and influence in this world. This is why we trade and have an agreement with the ‘Master’ in the north. We receive human vessels and nectar from the ‘Master.’</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
