 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What was going on with those two? How come the skill wasn’t applying to them? They were at the center of the target where the electric waves overlapped.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Although Dongye adjusted his energy level, it shouldn</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’t be possible for the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;two&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">look at him with smiles on their faces. At the very least, they should have gone into general paralysis and convulsions…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye smacked his lips. Then he slowly retracted his energy. The people&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">within</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;his energy field started exhaling deeply. The Dong-Myung Clan’s flagship martial skills were centered on electricity and chemistry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Based on his assessment, if the opponents were Awakened warriors who could go against his electricity field, Dongye would be in an unfavorable position.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">He had taken th</span><span style="font-weight: 400">e initiative</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;to put forth a dignified warning to the other side as if to say, ‘Don’t fool around with&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">me</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.’ Otherwise,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">i</span><span style="font-weight: 400">t wouldn’t&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">have done anyone any good</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;to have a big fight ahead of the hunting event…&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At least, that’s what Dongye tried to do…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dongye smiled at the two people and walked confidently towards them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How did it look to you? Was it similar to my level?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San asked Biyeon in a whisper.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Do you think</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;that was his maximum output?” she answered in a small voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘!!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye stood&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">up straight</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. He snapped his neck&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">back</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;and stopped abruptly in front of the two. The warriors following him hurriedly stepped aside, barely avoiding a collision with their leader.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dongye stood in front of the two. He had on a serious expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My name is Dongye from the Dong-Myung Clan. Who are you? Where are you from?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San looked at&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;eyes for a moment before calmly replying</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;with</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">t</span><span style="font-weight: 400">he ends of his mouth r</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ising</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;slightly</span><span style="font-weight: 400">,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“My name is San, and this person</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">s name is Yeon. Do I have an obligation to answer your questions?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye stood speechless. He didn’t expect this answer. D</span><span style="font-weight: 400">idn’t</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;these people know the name of his clan? Anyone who had the same surname&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Dong</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">within the</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Dong-Myung Clan was specially treated as ‘royalty’.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone knew this. At least everyone who had enough stature to be in the Count’s banquet would know!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">His insides became cold. Tremendous energy suddenly burst from&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;body. After that, the clan warriors behind him also opened their energy fields to the fullest, preparing for something to happen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What you just said… can I interpret your words as an open insult to our Dong-Myung Clan?” Dongye asked, bringing his hand to the belt around his waist. His voice was quiet yet firm.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The surrounding people were trembling. His words conjured a fishy blood-like smell. It was the smell of blood being spilled… The Count wanted to close his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well- such a funny uncle. Wasn’t it you who first approached us and asked questions? Do I have any obligation to answer you? You seem to be mistaken… I’m not your subordinate. Also…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San’s eyes shone fiercely once he paused his words. Dongye’s fingers were fiddling with his belt.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I wouldn’t do that… If you take out that weapon now, you’ll die.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San’s voice was calm. However, Dongye felt San’s words crashing into his ear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And everyone behind this funny uncle…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Right beside San, Biyeon’s voice rang out lazily like a monologue.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dongye couldn’t move. The Dong-Myung Clan warriors couldn’t release any energy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They heard more than the sound of San and Biyeon’s voice. Their bodies sent constant warnings as if assured them that they were on the cusp of death.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A person’s body usually gives an honest answer. It was an ‘instinct’. It’s also the fundamental ‘survival instinct’ that precedes one’s will…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye sensed a terribl</span><span style="font-weight: 400">y frightening</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">aura</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. He was a veteran</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;and an</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;Awakened Warrior. There was no way he was afraid of death. Therefore, in his mind, this&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">aura couldn’t possibly</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;be the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">cautionary sign</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;of impending death.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">But he didn’t know what it was. His former intentions had already been broken into pieces. He was like a child who was scolded by adults. What did he see in these two young people?</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">He had never faced this sort of conf</span><span style="font-weight: 400">using yet dire situation</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;even within&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">his</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;clan.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dongye’s fingertips trembled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘An overwhelming presence, perhaps?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San laughed. It was not a laugh with ridicule. It was pure laughter. It</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;was</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;the exact same kind of laugh that would</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;be given to</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;a child.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">How could Dongye understand? This&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">deadly</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;aura and scent could only be sent out by a man and woman who had killed thousands upon thousands of monsters and had gone through the pain of tens of thousands of deaths.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Dongye sensed, the scent wasn’t the scent of death. Rather, it was closer to the opposite.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It represented the two’s great will to exist on their own. It was the ‘purification of existence’ that crawled out from their constant struggles against a gruesome death. Indeed… that’s how they had been awakened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Their ‘presence’ wasn’t developed through the constant consumption of weak ‘fragments’ that were fed to them like the warriors inside&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">the absolute</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;clans. Their presence came from&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">personal</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;struggle and sacrifice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s eat now?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dongye raised his head at the man’s sudden words. San smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I think you're old enough to know not to throw around your weight at an event like this, no? It’s not like we’re neighborhood gangsters who are comparing the thickness of our forearms or anything…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San strode forward. He tapped Dongye’s shoulders and went ahead. Biyeon waved her hand at them and also passed by. Dongye stood and stared blankly at their backs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The other warriors from the Dong-Myung Clan also stood staring at the two without taking any action. The hall was completely silent. No one dared to take a breath.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Count and Countess were looking at Dongye anxiously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tuk-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A drop of sweat fell from Dongye’s forehead onto the floor. There were still quite a few sweat droplets that seemed to be anxiously awaiting their turn to fall from his face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘An electric field… how?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When San smacked his shoulder, a jolt of electricity struck his body. The effects happened in an instant. His neural and nerve network was paralyzed at that moment. It was as if the main terminal that connected and controlled his limbs were torn and broken.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, when the woman waved her hand, an electromagnetic storm relentlessly swept through his body.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And with this…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their ability to charge electricity from the cells of their body had all been discharged. Dongye and all of his accompanying warriors felt the same sudden discharge and emptiness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Excluding his physical ability to accelerate, Dongye felt that all of his learned clan skills became neutralized. The energy that he had cultivated and stored up to now was completely depleted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A weapon that couldn’t use electricity would just be a stick. Swordsmanship was not a strength of Dong-Myung Clan warriors.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Huh- I’ll have to recharge for at least 4 days. Was there such a fatal weakness in our abilities?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye clenched his jaw while fixing his eyes on the receding back of the two figures. No one&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">in the banquet hall</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;noticed, but his legs were trembling. He could taste something sweet yet bitter within his tightly closed mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">'Until&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">we’re recharged</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, our lives are in their hands. In the meantime, we’ll have to lay low and keep our distance…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wasn’t it a bit severe? They must feel quite broken…” Biyeon said in a small voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Contrary to her question, she wasn’t worried about the Dong-Myung Clan warriors at all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Not really…. Forget about them. They need to know how embarrassed they should be. Because we used their own skill on them, there’s nowhere for them to go and complain. If they truly think about it, it’s something they should be grateful for.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is that so?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Anyway… aren’t our principles firm in this world? We don’t have to respect those who don’t treat us well. Our status here is not given by law. We never agreed. Even if we get hurt, we dictate the terms.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Still, I feel&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">uncomfortable</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;and itchy all over thinking about what they might try to do&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">to get</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;revenge.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then scratch…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Count was relieved. Nothing unexpected happened. The banquet meal&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">progressed</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;smoothly without a hitch. He was concerned about Dongye’s expression and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">possible</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;further conduct, but it seemed there was nothing to worry about.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The warriors of Dong-Myung Clan were eating ‘kindly’ without saying anything… Other people, like the nobles, were mixing moderate alcohol and discussion topics, making the general atmosphere within the banquet hall jovial.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, there were always exceptions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Does the meal not suit your taste?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Countess carefully asked San, who was sitting next to her. A worried expression appeared on her face. The maids who were serving the meals didn’t know what to do either. San and Biyeon ate little by little, very slowly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The speed was so slow that they only ate half when others emptied their dishes. From the host’s point of view, this was a</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;concerning</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, of course not! It’s so delicious…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was some moisture around his eyes. Biyeon was also eating slowly with red eyes. They were having a human meal for the first time in a while. Their current image didn’t suit their amazing powers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If that's the case, that’s fortunate, but… don’t burden yourself and eat slowly.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The meal was amazing. Like the cuisine of most northern regions, the dishes were meat-oriented rather than grain-oriented, and because it was early spring, stored, dried, or pickled vegetables were present in every dish.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grains, which were considered staple foods, were mainly ground and powdered into noodles, as they could then be stored long-term. As it wasn’t the grain harvesting season, the dishes with grain-based noodles weren’t as tasty or rich as the other dishes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, every dish was delicious and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">memorable</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;for San and Biyeon. This was the first time in over a year eating starch-rich grains.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The natives here didn’t use chopsticks. They used forks, knives, and spoons like the Western people on Earth. It seemed that the nobles here ate with the same types of utensils.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As for the alcohol, fruit wine was given. It was very strong, a characteristic of cold region wines.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San was enjoying the effects of the alcohol, especially after a long absence of not having any.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though he recalled having to drink alcohol by the buckets in order to prove his manhood in the military, the atmosphere here allowed him to slowly sip the wine and enjoy its spicy, aromatic flavor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">He couldn’t let his guard down and fully relax</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, but&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">he was still able</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;to enjoy&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">the experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The fresh spring breeze blew through the open hall windows. It was a warm and friendly gust, harmonizing well with the spicy wine.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘There’s no doubt that he was a nobleman or someone of higher status.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Count comfortably tilted his glass and nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The dining room was possibly the only place where one c</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ould</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;judge all of humanity</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’s diverse range of people</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. The behavior of the two completely relieved his anxiety.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">If an invited guest look</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ed</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;shabby or behave</span><span style="font-weight: 400">d</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;rudely, one would be upset.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Their uncultured actions would</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;be an inexcusable slight against everyone else invited, and it would soon become a burden for the host.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the Count believed in his senses. In addition, he was carefully calculating the future impact of these newly hired ‘Awakeners’.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">If there was a dispute with the Dong-Myung clansmen, he was determined to mediate the clash himself. Even a group of Dong-Myung Clansmen couldn’t ignore a Count that control</span><span style="font-weight: 400">led</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;and rule</span><span style="font-weight: 400">d</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;over a territory, no matter how provincial.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Count’s eyes closely followed the two’s actions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They weren’t clumsy in handling the various utensils, and they were neither picky nor greedy in eating food. A surprisingly natural dignity emanated from them, even when drinking a lot of wine.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Once the main courses were over, dessert was served. Conversations continued here and there. The conversations around the various dinner tables were naturally flowing. The</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;conversations spanned</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;a wide range of topics.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">They discussed stories&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">about</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;everyday life, manor management, world situations and events, ongoing wars, warrior fights and battles, marriages between nobles, etc.…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San and Biyeon listened intently to the stories rather than actively participat</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ing</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;in any of the conversations.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">In truth, they didn’t have anything to share. There was no story they could tell that the others would understand.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ll their effort was focused&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">on understanding</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;this new world.</span></p>
