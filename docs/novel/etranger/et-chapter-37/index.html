 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Biyeon looked at San and smiled. She gazed at the young Yekin before returning her attention to San.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He doesn’t want to talk. He’s thinking that he’ll just cut you down and take the sword. He seems fair-skinned and pretty, but he’s rather thick-headed.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San licked his lips. He looked Yekin up and down.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It looks like I made a mistake. I apologize. My question was</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;innocent</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. It seems that it’s rude to ask someone’s age here, right? However, I don’t think it should be to the point where we clash with swords.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yekin couldn’t retort and was lost for a moment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San’s words followed</span><span style="font-weight: 400">,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, let me simply answer your question. First, I have no intention of selling this sword to a child like you. Second, I don't even intend to die from the likes of you. Third, using the words you said earlier, ‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Your</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;sword is a waste for the likes of you’, I felt a little bad when I heard this. Can I interpret what you said as an insult to me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Be respectful and polite. You lowly thing!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yekin bent his knees and sprung forward towards San. His movements were surprisingly sharp and light.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the same time, from the joints of his shoulders to his wrists, his arm stretched out with the tip of his sword thrust in a straight line. He was aiming at San’s left chest. The speed of his strike was very fast.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">There&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">seemed to be</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;no time to avoid it. Yekin’s lips slightly r</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ose</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm… you’re in such a hurry…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yekin heard San muttering. He opened his eyes wide as the tip of his sword slightly pas</span><span style="font-weight: 400">sed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;San’s shoulder, floating harmlessly in mid-air. San had moved to his right. His movement was so natural and effortless that it seemed he had always been in that position.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tuk-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yekin quickly rotated his foot and tried to face&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">his</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;left side. He stumbled, losing his balance momentarily. After a few steps, he found his footing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yekin turned his head towards San.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">San</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;stood naturally while stroking his chin and look</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ing</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;at Yekin.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">San</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;smiled wide with eyes full of curiosity.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You… you!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yekin stuttered aloud as he looked around. He saw the nobles that he invited, the various clan people who were present in the square, and other residents with amused and smirking expressions on their faces.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even the women</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;were looking at the newcomer with</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;surprised eyes…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;large crowd had already gathered behind them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly, Yekin felt anxiety. He might be disgraced beyond repair if he made another misstep.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">When he went in for&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">a fatal</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;strike, he felt his heel being tapped. Thanks to that, he almost lost his balance and fell.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">If the heel tap had been any stronger, Yekin would have collapsed into the mud. Goosebumps started rising up his back. As a special warrior who had already crossed the threshold of the Master Warrior state (1</span><span style="font-weight: 400">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">S</span><span style="font-weight: 400">tage&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400">cceleration), Yekin was terrified about his opponent</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’s martial level</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yekin raised his sword. His face was no longer red but white with tension. This wartime world was ruled by the strong. The person standing in front of him was relaxed. He wondered if the opponent was that much stronger than himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Regardless, the situation was self-made. He needed to conclude it in some way. That meant he had to give this fight his all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yekin calmed his breathing. He strengthened&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">his</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;gr</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ip</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;on his sword. A jolt of energy ran through his body as he accelerated.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">How happy w</span><span style="font-weight: 400">as he when he reached this level</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">? How much effort did he put into reaching this level? He had given so much to reach this level…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He couldn’t make any mistakes now. He had to do his best. His eyes calmed and sank in.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’re a hidden power. I formally withdraw what I said earlier that you weren’t qualified to hold that sword. However, since we’ve already insulted each other to this extent… let me formally apply for a duel. My name is Yekin from the House of Count Essen. Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, if you came out that way from the start, we would’ve just resolved this through conversation… I’m not used to your unscrupulous way of speaking. Anyway, my name is San and my friend standing there is Yeon. Do we have to fight?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He asked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Where are you from?” Yekin asked, tilting his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You won’t know even if I told you. Just know that it’s somewhere over the great mountain ranges in the north.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Okay, it doesn’t matter where you come from. Lift up your weapon. I hope you don't spoil my honor!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is… a little awkward.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San turned his face toward Biyeon. She nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If this is the only way… Are we going to duel here?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San pulled out a short sword from his waist. Yekin’s face distorted again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you going to insult me to the end? Are you trying to fight me with that dagger?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You sure talk a lot, friend. I have no intention of defeating my younger friend with the advantage of a weapon. Hope you understand.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yekin squeezed his sword. He shouldn’t concern himself with the enemy’s choice. Each w</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ould soon</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;showcase their own specialty and martial arts prowess…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">A warm spring breeze blew. The plaza was now filled with people, causing the heat to rise. However, in the middle of the square,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">frigid,</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;tight energy&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">began</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to rise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What's going on outside?” inquired an elderly person. He was looking outside with his hands behind his back. He was in the Count’s Office on the third floor of the castle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was the owner of this place, Count Essen. He became curious after seeing the crowds gathering in the square below.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had a strong-looking, angular face, a mustache, and a gorgeous white satin uniform with a cape. The clasp that connected the cloak had Count Essen’s coat of arms engraved on it. It flashed blue in the spring sun.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will find out and report back, my lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The attendant hurriedly went outside and, after a while, came back with a rough breath. He reported to the Count with a</span><span style="font-weight: 400">n exasperated</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The second prince is in a duel with an outsider.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Second Prince? A&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">d</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">uel?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes! He is against a stranger from the north. The opponent seems to have come to participate in this year</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’s&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">hunting festival.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, this frivolous son of mine… he’s just risen to become a Master Warrior, but his mentality is still untrained and wild. So, why are they fighting? What’s the reason?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it is said that the sword possessed by the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">visiting</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;hunter is made of Archon’s bone. So, the second prince asked if he could purchase the sword, but the owner dared to say no.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What? It’s a sword made of Archon’s bones?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, my lord. It is said to be genuine.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Essen’s eyes sparkled. If this were true, it was a little understandable why the prince acted so haphazardly. The Count himself was also a pursuer of martial power.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Although he hadn’t reached the Awakened Warrior (similar to 3</span><span style="font-weight: 400">rd</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">S</span><span style="font-weight: 400">tage of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400">cceleration) state, he was a Dark Warrior (similar to the 2</span><span style="font-weight: 400">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">S</span><span style="font-weight: 400">tage of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400">cceleration&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">for San and Biyeon</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. He had</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;surpass</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;the level of Master Warrior a while ago.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even within the Dark Warrior level, the Count had reached a state where he eliminated any pain from accelerati</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ng through the Master Warrior stage</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The speed and power of a Dark Warrior were beyond the imagination of commoners&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">in</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;this world. The main issue for Dark Warriors were their weapons, as most weapons couldn’t handle the stress and movement that Dark Warriors were able to put out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That was why a good sword, especially one made from the bones of an Archon, was a treasure that even Master Warriors would covet. No martial artist would be free from temptation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was especially so for a young blooded son like his…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s go out.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The count strode out with his mouth firmly closed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yekin couldn’t believe the situation he was in. Tears started forming in his eyes. He truly tried his best. He had used all of his skills. He had entered the duel with a decision to either win or die trying.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, he couldn’t even touch a strand of the opponent’s hair. The opponent seem</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ed to</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;move slowly. However, no matter how daring his attack was, each attack&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">fell</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;nowhere near the opponent once it was made.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed as if his opponent knew exactly where the tip of his sword was headed. All the while,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">h</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">is opponent’s steps moved slowly, like a lazy spring day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yekin stabbed, cut, and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">contorted his body to try and catch up with the rapidly moving San</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. San twisted in unexpected directions whenever an attack was launched. Yekin barely followed San as he</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">sway</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ed</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">from side to</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;side. San was never in the ‘place’ where Yekin attacked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yekin stare</span><span style="font-weight: 400">d</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;at the man in front of him while taking deep&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">breaths</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Even though he was out of breath, his opponent didn’t seem bothered in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sweat flowed down Yekin’s face and body. His parched neck was drenched outwardly in sweat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you going to continue?” San asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">He asked with complete serious</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ness</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. It was not an expression hiding any ulterior motive. There was no sense of ridicule on his face. Rather, San had on a satisfied face. He seemed quite impressed with the young man’s manly spirit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sure!” Yekin yelled as he started his attacks again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had to try everything he had learned. He needed to pour out everything. He had to stand up for his pride as a noble.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even if he lost or broke down, he must do his all to not feel regret. Tears covered his face, but he didn’t feel ashamed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The opponent was strong. Absurdly strong. Didn’t this mean he had to challenge him?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Okay… very good.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San moved. His short sword received Yekin’s sword strikes. San swiped a strike away and moved a step towards Yekin. Yekin changed his sword’s direction and quickly attacked his opponent’s mid-section.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San struck the tip of Yekin’s sword again and twisted its intended orbit. Yekin’s body spun. Once he regained control</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;over</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;his body</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, he</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;raised his sword high in the air once more. Yekin</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;raised his</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;fighting spirit&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">once</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The tip of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Yekin’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;sword came alive whenever&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">San</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;parried&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">an attack</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Brilliant and economical attacks unfolded without ceasing. San was also silently taking Yekin’s attacks seriously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The square was very quiet. People stared at the confrontation with their mouths open. It was a&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">fantastic performance of martial</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">arts</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">They were seeing</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">the clear difference of a warrior’s skill</span><span style="font-weight: 400">-level</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;and appreciated the dignity of</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;San’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;power,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">which</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;easily overwhelmed a Master Warrior.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tuk-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yekin’s sword stopped. It got caught on something. Yekin’s eyes trembled while following the sword’s intended trajectory with his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The tip of his sword was held in San’s gloved hand. No matter how much strength he put into the sword, it refused to budge. Instead, San’s sword was already in front of his nose.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gulp-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yekin swallowed down hard. If it wasn’t the tip of his sword that was being held, he would have felt less frustrated. However, the reality of the situation made it clear that he was no match for his opponent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He did his best and showed all his skills and abilities. He looked at San once more. San looked back at Yekin with a blank expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yekin slowly shook his head. He took in a large, rough breath. Afterward, he with</span><span style="font-weight: 400">drew and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">sheathed his sword.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I lost,” he said briefly, swallowing his breath. San smiled. Yekin raised his head and looked around. He could see the crowd standing with blank faces.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yekin felt strangely relaxed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">In spite of the overwhelming difference in skill</span><span style="font-weight: 400">-level</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, his opponent had taken his ‘face’ into account. San had limited his ability to the point where Yekin wouldn’t be ashamed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It was a good match. It feels great to be dueling with such a lively friend. Anyway, I apologize for the mistake I made earlier. I hope you will accept it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I should apologize for being rude. I didn’t know you were this strong. I’m sorry for my behavior before.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you. Now go and see your business. We also have our own business to conduct. We need to start moving around because we lack money…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San turned around with a smile. Biyeon was smiling back. As he walked towards her, he heard her quietly state, “Great. The situation seems to have been resolved better than we expected, no?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. In this type of class society, our status is for us to decide. It</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">s very unpleasant to be pre-determined into a class by others. As you said, advanced information only comes from higher classes. There are so many things we need to find out and know.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clap-clap-clap-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly, the sound of applause rang in the quiet square. People bent their heads and waists towards the place where the applause was coming from. There, Count Essen stood tall, looking straight at San and Biyeon while clapping his hands.</span></p>
