Wasn’t she also the Goddess of Hunting?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Yes, she was.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[What’re the chances that they have the same name and title? This world… if this was all planned from the start… it’s a bit interesting, no? We may have really entered the world of the gods. Anyways…]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San looked forward&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">at Dite</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;once more.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><span style="font-weight: 400">H</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ow strong do you think Dite is?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Her physical capabilities are definitely weaker than ours. The issue is that the god can use her body as a vessel and exert her godly abilities… I don’t know what that would look like.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Biyeon blinked her eyes and looked at San. He was looking down at the ground and slowing his steps.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Hmm… I wonder what she can do with that body. In my eyes, her body doesn’t compare to yours in strength or ability.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[She mentioned that gods live off of the faith given to them by humans. If there are more believers providing faith, wouldn’t her abilities also increase in strength?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">She kept her attention on San while conveying her words. She wondered what he was</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;thinking</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;about.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Yeah… everyone needs something in order to survive. Should we make an ‘organization’ too?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[For right now, I think it’ll be extra weight on us rather than any help…]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[I agree. Why would anyone follow us… the problem now is… those Sages. What are your thoughts on them? They’re probably pursuing us too, right?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San raised his head and met Biyeon’s eyes. He could trust her judgment and analysis.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Though they had to make conjectures based on scraps of information, they still needed to set a course on their future actions and goals. Once they gained a steady source of information from the gods, they’d be better prepared to exact an effective, large</span><span style="font-weight: 400">-</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">scale plan.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[I’m not sure. It’s probably the same as losing a wild animal in a large zoo, no? I don’t think they’re in a rush to find us. I think they’re collecting information from various sources and triangulating our whereabouts rather than searching for us directly. Furthermore, since we’ve finalized a long-term contract with Dite and Goddess Diana, I don’t think our pursuers are in any rush to find us.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[That makes me feel a little better. Do you think the Master’s sources of information are through the gods?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[According to Dite, the Master and the gods are in a business relationship, so it’s possible that they’re also providing information in their dealings. If the gods’ vessels were experimental objects like we were, then all of the vessels are probably addicted to nectar. I feel like the Master is using that connection to constantly trade with the gods. I believe that the gods are interested in us because we’re living samples that can break this dependence on the Master, since we’re not addicted to nectar and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">are</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, for the most part, self-made.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[That’s probably why Dite wasn’t speaking very much about herself or about the gods. Diana is probably working both&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">sides</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, right? I think my head is a bit more organized now. We really have some dog shit fate…]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[That’s also why we need to be wiser and better prepared than the gods.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[Let’s survive. As for Pasoon and Satan or whatever their names&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">we</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">re… I feel like they’re the actual devils that we’re accustomed to. I don’t want to meet them if we can avoid it. I really dislike horror films…]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San lifted a hand and snapped a tree branch. The lively branch oozed out clear, green liquid. He stuck the piece of the branch between his lips. It tasted bitter. However, he liked the feeling of sensing something living, which made him feel that he was living as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[That’s… that’s right. Satan and Pasoon. Even those names sound scary. Who do you think the Creator is?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She gulped loudly. Though she grew distant with religion later in life, she still recalled the god she prayed to and believed in when she was younger. There was a chance that god existed, but she didn’t want to outwardly state this, as if her words would bring her thoughts into reality.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Listening to Dite, I think the only way we’ll be able to resolve our issues is to meet with this Creator. I especially want to know why we have to live like this here…]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[I want to know too…]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[What higher purpose does he have for us? Hopefully, I can get a few punches in as well if we ever do meet the Creator. I feel so used!]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their gazes were now on the various people that were beside the street. Most of the people were enjoying the flower-scented spring weather. There were others who were starting to enter into budding relationships.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San whispered,</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you happier today than yesterday?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tomorrow will probably be better than today, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San was looking out towards the distance. He continued,</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s live with that in mind… to live better, happier lives every day… until the end…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For now…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a spring day that carried the hopes and dreams of the living… a new start…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Episode 2. Book 2: Planning – Chapter 7</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Human ties are such subtle things. Once a connection is made, no one knows how far it’ll last or extend. Work was like that too. Once one task was finished, another opportunity opened up. Working allowed more work to come in.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Having finished their first task in their first contracted job, a second task soon followed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Many of the hunters had sold their shares and were heading back home. Some warriors found lovers during this festival period, so they decided to marry and stay in the area. These types of large events were a good opportunity to bring in skilled people into a territory and keep them within. The Count believed that it was time for an outward excursion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How many people will be with us?” asked San.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I believe that twenty should be enough,” the Count answered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And the term?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“At least four months.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Understood. We’ll prepare immediately. When should we leave?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As soon as you two are ready.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then we’ll leave in ten days. We’ll have to first organize the necessary supplies and personnel.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The second task assigned to San and Biyeon&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">was</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;to convert the Archon bones and skin into money and gold. Since the Archon&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">material</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;were such invaluable items, many petty thieves and unwanted visitors had come into the Count’s territory recently. Rumors had quickly spread, so&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">the Count</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;needed to get rid of the source.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It wasn’t just the Archon material. An eclectic variety of known and unknown beasts and monsters were collected during this year’s hunt. The quantity was enormous, more than they had ever had before. Large merchant guilds and smaller merchant organizations had asked multiple times to trade for these items. This occasion was something the Count never faced before. It could be turned into a great opportunity if done properly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Count’s territory was not on the larger side. There were only a few blacksmiths and tanneries that could process the material they had on hand. Furthermore, the Count didn’t have the skilled laborers and artisans that could convert the raw materials into high-level products. So, he didn’t possess the capability to convert the raw materials into&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">usable</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;products, nor did he want to sell the raw materials to the visiting large merchant guilds at a low price.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The traveling merchants argued that they had to take great risks and expenses to transport the raw materials and convert them into final products. Thus, they tried to justify their low purchasing prices.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If the Archon and other exotic beasts’ bones were processed correctly, they would fetch a price twenty to a hundred times greater than what was stated by the merchants. In truth, there was more demand than supply, so proper pricing was difficult to do.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, the decision was made to go to the nearest large city and sell directly to consumers to maintain the value and pricing of the material. The closest large city was&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Porato</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, a two-month-long journey from the Count’s estate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The road to the city was filled with danger. There were various mercenary guilds, bandits, warrior groups, and mysterious races that one would have to face while clearing rocky mountains and</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">endless valleys. Usually, for these types of long-range movements, one would employ the services of large merchant guilds or clans with at least fifty veteran warriors. Only then would it be considered somewhat safe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Since sellers would usually have to pay a high fee for these services, they usually would not be able to carry their merchandise and sell it in the large cities. They would probably lose as much as they earned. Also, there was a high chance that they would lose part or all of their merchandise during transit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the merchandise&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">that the Count possessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">had to</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;be sold directly to the consumers. Also, San and Biyeon needed money.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400">heir goals&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">were</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;aligned.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The transaction was good for both parties. The Count would finally possess the means to develop his territories with the money from the sold goods. He and his people wouldn’t have to live such difficult lives if they had the funds to develop. For San and Biyeon, this trip would be their chance to understand this world better and spread their influence throughout the various territories.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Count prayed to the gods for the first time in his life. He could only interpret this chance and luck as coming directly from the gods. He felt that he would finally be free from the budget constraints</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;that continually held back his</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;deficit-laden territories. What could be better than having two Awakened warriors leading the way? It would be the best and most formidable transportation party.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although he didn’t have much evidence to believe so, the Count wanted to believe in San and Biyeon. He saw something deeper in their actions and thoughts. However, their behavior was very different from normal aristocratic and noble customs and norms.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Their way of thinking often p</span><span style="font-weight: 400">laced</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;him in an awkward situation. They were detailed, precise, and equal in their dealings. Aristocrats and nobles didn’t want to deal with numbers nor did they concern themselves with small issues. To concern oneself with these ‘trifling’ matters was a slight to the other party, as it was often seen as taking advantage of</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;the other</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. However, for the Count, their openness in being precise and detailed actually made him want to trust them more.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Problems that might arise w</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ould</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;always arise and even unknown issues w</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ould</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;rear their ugly head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You again?” San asked with wide-opened eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know a few people in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Porato</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;City. I can be of help,” Yeria answered with sharp eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I believe that the road we’ll take will be difficult for women to handle. Is that okay with you?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard that you’d be traveling with Captain Yeon. I believe that I’ll be of assistance during the travels.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Grab your stuff then.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You don’t have to thank me…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And you?” Biyeon asked while scrunching the area between her eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve finished my business on Count Essen’s estate. My home temple is also in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Porato</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;City,” Dite said with a laugh.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Will the other apostles follow too?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If you want…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I don’t want it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then… it’ll just be me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hey, hey. We’re not going on a field trip.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We want to broaden our horizons. We also have many things that we want to learn from both Captains,” Yekin replied while&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">sniffling</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;his nose. Next to him was the Count’s fifth daughter, Yesil, who just turned eighteen this year.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let me see your hands!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Excuse me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your hands are too soft and refined to do the hard work necessary during our travels. We’re not a royal procession. We’re going to go through hard times during our travels.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I won’t be a burden.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You will.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I also want to see the world and broaden my horizons. Please!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“At least make sure to bring a grinding stone to sharpen our swords…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is it?” San asked as he raised his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’ll need a bard to tell of your heroic and epic adventure across these treacherous lands. Someone has to document and disseminate your heroic feats!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Cecil the Bard smiled brightly. Next to him was the musician who had lent his instrument to San during the banquet. He was blinking his eyes like he didn’t understand what was going on.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Two of you?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Come with us. And for you, use these strings for your instrument. It’s Archon tendons. They won’t snap or break as easily as the strings you use.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After speaking with people who ‘needed’ to join their party for one reason or another, the total number of travelers expanded to a little over thirty people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Since there were two Awakened warriors leading this traveling party, all sorts of people brought up various reasons for why they needed to tag along. Based on combat power, they all felt that this would be the safest way to travel.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San and Biyeon didn’t dislike this type of atmosphere either. The more people they had, the greater their ability to collect information as they traveled. They’d also be able to create a mini-community from which they could recollect the taste and smells of human society. In the end, they were also humans who yearned for and enjoyed the presence of other humans.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, San and Biyeon were firm with their rules. For all those who would be traveling with them, three promises had to be kept.</span></p>
