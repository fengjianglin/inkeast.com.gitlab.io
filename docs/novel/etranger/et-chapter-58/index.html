 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After a moment of silence, the three discussed other matters for a while.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, Dongye was locked in deep thought, not daring to intervene in the conversation. Although he listened silently, it was difficult for him to grasp their conversation’s meanings.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, it was difficult for him to understand this unrealistic situation&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">where</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;humans were communicat</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ing</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;with a god on equal footing.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Dongye understood that the situation that was unfolding in the north would become a serious issue in the near future.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;T</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">he most urgent task for him was to go back to his clan, analyze the complex situation that was about to unfold, make preparations, and establish a relationship with these two Awakeners.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San tilted his head and drank the last few drops of his drink. He then asked,</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Since you’re a god, let me ask you one more question. Can we go back to the world we came from?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I do not know. If one could bring you here, that one could send you back again, right?” Dite briefly replied.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Who do you think brought us here?” Biyeon asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I'm not sure, but I’m guessing that ‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400">O</span><span style="font-weight: 400">riginal Beings</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">’ have such powers.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Original Beings? Who are they?” asked San.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is said that they were the Creator’s vessels, entities that carried out his will and commands.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Does that ‘Creator’ mean the creator of this universe?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s right. We call that being ‘Creator’ or ‘Original One’.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Biyeon stared at the small bonfire burning in the middle of the table. Firewood burst and sparks splattered here and there.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind the shaking light caused by the bonfire, she could see a barrier that was set far away. The grid pattern of the fence entered her eyes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She felt a strange similarity between that pattern and her thoughts…it was difficult to express in words. There was some connection there… Biyeon felt stuffy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They’re probably really strong, right?” muttered San.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Probably…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A fleeting expression of fear briefly passed Dite’s face, but San’s face was calm. He drank another glass of the strong liquor and got up from his seat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Biyeon also got up without changing her expression and turned around after&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">saying</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;farewell. As she was turning around, she&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">asked Dite</span><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“By the way, how many Original Beings are there? And what do the gods call them?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They are hidden. There are four known existences that we’ve heard or seen of so far. They are said to call themselves Pasoon, Set, Loki, and Satan. They're also referred to as the 'Fallen'.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Biyeon’s forward motion suddenly stopped.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Satan…?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Episode 2. Book 2: Planning – Chapter 4</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The hunt was winding down after four days.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was originally a 10-day schedule, but the hunters concluded that they could no longer hunt.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The reasons were twofold. One</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, they caught</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;too much prey on the first night. The number of beasts caught on the first day was more than five times that of all the beasts caught by all hunters in last year’s hunt.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If the dead beasts were not processed quickly, decay and loss of value would occur. Another reason was that the number of beasts in the area had dried up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The hunters who left to hunt in the morning gathered back at the square in the evening. Most came back empty-handed, and some probably stayed somewhere safe in the woods to pass time.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, the expressions of the returning hunters were bright. Th</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ey were generally happy</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;because this year’s harvest was so great, and</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">all of them had participated in the first night’s battle, so their share of the spoils would also be large.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Once the last of the sorting was done tomorrow, everyone planned to withdraw. Each person’s share would be determined by status and class… or that’s what everyone thought…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amidst this general malaise, the specially commissioned support staff were busy at work. On one hand, they sorted the beasts and dismantled them into parts.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">nother group was working on the troublesome task of measuring, counting, and distributing the spoils.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Some of the staff left for the estate first. This was in order to request assistance for the transportation of a huge amount of spoils. In case of danger, a few Dong-Myung warriors accompanied the traveling support staff.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">San and Biyeon, true to themselves, went around and did the necessary ‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400">administration</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;of</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;the hunt. Thanks to their constant questions, the support staff’s lips were protruding outward. However, this didn’t stop San and Biyeon from asking their questions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why was this classified like this?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This part of the beast is scarce and precious, so it’s given to the nobleman.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why are the skins and bones of this Archon separate in this way?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Because the Jane Clan’s officer, Narim, asked me to take dismantle one like this…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are those separate scraps? Will you throw it away?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s for the hunters who aren’t affiliated with a group.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Who decided the proportion and method of dividing this way?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s the way we’ve been doing it for many years.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s this?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s the portion to be taken to the shrine and dedicated to the god.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why so m</span><span style="font-weight: 400">uch</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If we divide it to be sent to the four temples, this is actually a small amount.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How does this hunt help the people of Count Essen’s territory?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As foreigners come to exchange things or spend money, it helps merchants. The warriors of the estate can get paid as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How much does Count Essen take?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“10% of the total intake.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How much do other estates usually take when they conduct their hunt?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It depends on the status and power of the estate or territory. It’s said that the Grand Dukes or Dukes usually takes about 30%, and the Marquis takes about 20%. Our Count is still pioneering and developing his territory…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San laughed bleakly at the answers before turning his head toward Biyeon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His expression was complicated.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“In the end, it’s a story of having nothing left after being ripped off by everyone else. In this world, bad guys such as gangsters, scammers, and so on seem to operate in the same way. This is a rotten situation.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s unfair. After roughly calculating this and that, the Count will just barely meet his costs. He’d be fortunate if there’s no deficit. In the end, this hunt is an event where strong people around the world legally extort the hunting resources of the weak territories under the guise of protecting the territory from monsters. It’s also a structure wherein junior warriors and young people must bear the brunt of the responsibilities and risk. In short, the expenditure for the safety of the estate is too high,” Biyeon said coldly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What was the Count’s request? How far can we use our authority?” asked San.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“He asked us to be ‘fair’</span><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400">” B</span><span style="font-weight: 400">iyeon replied.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you think his intention was?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm… exactly as you think right now,” Biyeon stated in a slightly uncomfortable voice. She seemed to be squeezing out her words, little by little. She was surprised by her own unconfident voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even for her, she thought the way she spoke was incredibly awkward. She forgot to use honorifics when speaking to San. San tilted his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You? Not going to use honorifics anymore, huh? You’ve certainly grown up, haven’t you?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San playfully patted Biyeon’s back, causing her to flinch, and then walked forward.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It has a good ring to it, ‘you’.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He walked forward cheerfully and hummed a tune.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… not bad at all. It was okay, actually. That’s good. That’s good. Ms. Biyeon… our ‘Miss Biyeon’ has grown up.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She quickly followed behind him, wiping off the sweat coming down from her forehead with a handkerchief. She felt that the cool spring weather was passing by too quickly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you roughly done?” asked Biyeon. Her voice was full of irritation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m still far from done. This task isn’t easy. It requires concentration and takes time. It’s very different from physical labor,” Yeria responded bluntly without raising her&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">head</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Her hand kept moving a small stick, while the other hand was writing something down.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">She was in the process of dividing and distributing the spoils, classifying them according to a set standard. It took a lot of calculation to add the various lots and to properly apply the distribution ratios.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">All of the groups participating in the hunt were keen about their share of spoils, so it was necessary to verify the accuracy</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;of the</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;calculations over and over.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The main problem at hand was the fact that among the many people in the support staff, Yeria was the only one with computational skills. It was also one of the reasons the Count sent his second daughter with the support staff.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">She was an essential person in this organization. In fact, it was rare for even large cities to have a talented woman with&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">her level of</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;skills and beauty.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeria was a high-quality financial resource who learned wealth management and necessary calculation skills in a university-level clan.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Warriors generally have poor computational skills. Officer-designated warriors may be strong in discourse and logic, but they hated dealing with numbers.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Working with numbers in this age, without calculators, meant very cumbersome calculations and simple iterations. The nobles hated this kind of ‘head’ usage, which consume</span><span style="font-weight: 400">d</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;time and energy</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. C</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ounting, above all, was avoided whenever possible. So, these numbers and calculations were usually performed by hiring commoners from the upper class.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">At th</span><span style="font-weight: 400">is</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;moment, Yeria was the main person</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;responsible for this thankless job. She was also growing&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">very angry.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">She was clearly frustrated&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">in being</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;assigned this mundane and tedious job, especially considering her status as the Count’s daughter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeria had worked with her hair wrapped up for half the day, barely sorting out and calculating half the lots. However, her supervisor instructed her to set a new standard and recalculate the lots and distribution amounts.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Biyeon seemed to treat the calculations as a joke to get done quickly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s so complex?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Why is it</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;tak</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ing</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;you so much time?” Biyeon said as she glanced over the worksheet.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">In her opinion, no matter how she looked at it, Yeria’s words and actions were close to intentional sabotage and insubordination. In addition, a subtle sense of competitiveness started to rear i</span><span style="font-weight: 400">n her</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;head.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Are you rebelling, Yeria? Really?</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it’s that easy,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Ms. Captain</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;should go ahead and try it herself!” Yeria screamed impatiently. She, too, was a high-ranking noble who couldn’t be ignored or pushed around in society. Though she didn’t want to disobey her father, the Count, she really couldn’t stand this person who seemed to have an illogical sense of reasoning. Although charming and mysterious, Captain Biyeon&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">wa</span><span style="font-weight: 400">s&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">asking for</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;too much…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Give me the writing tool. And bring a blank piece of paper,” Biyeon said, finally deciding to do the work herself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yeria handed over the materials and stared at Biyeon with cold eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As time passed, her facial expression gradually changed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her expression was at f</span><span style="font-weight: 400">irst&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">filled with</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;ridicule, then curiosity, then surprise, then finally suspicion…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Biyeon reviewed Yeria’s written work and then tilted her head from side to side. She frowned at the almost illegible, childish approach Yeria took in writing and calculating.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">At that po</span><span style="font-weight: 400">i</span><span style="font-weight: 400">nt in time, Yeria was still smugly smiling. Before long though, Biyeon brought another blank piece of paper and started drawing a spreadsheet table.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The shape of the table was a bizarre shape that Yeria had never seen before. Horizontal and vertical lines crisscrossed with subdivided item names on the horizontal cells and participant names on the vertical lines.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">After making her spreadsheet, Biyeon</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;started filling in the empty cells with the basic info Yeria had handed over.</span></p>
