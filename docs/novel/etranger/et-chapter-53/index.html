 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The two communicated remotely from a distance. Various abilities were acquired through the amplification and modulation of their recently obtained electromagnetic wave</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;ability</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Furthermore, they were able to expand their detection capabilities by better understanding an</span><span style="font-weight: 400">d</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">implementing</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;electromagnetic wave principles on their current abilities.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">One of these newfound upgrades was in their ‘communication</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;ability. They were able to amplify their communication by using ‘electromagnetic waves’ as their main frequency. Additionally, their echolocation-like ability was upgraded, allowing them to triangulate moving objects with greater precision.</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Episode 2. Book 1: Exploration – Chapter 18</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The last Algon’s head exploded as it fell onto the bloodied ground. It seemed that all the dangerous monsters and beasts were&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">taken care of</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye looked around. He ha</span><span style="font-weight: 400">d</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;already caught three Algons by himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">A total of 12 Algons were caught this evening alone. A countless number of Alpins and other smaller beasts were caught</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;as well</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Among them, there were quite a few beasts he’d never seen before.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;dead beasts</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;were&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">scattered</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;throughout the plaza. The surviving monsters and beasts fled back into the forest.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The night’s hunt was coming to a close.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;examined the entire square in detail. There were still small fires everywhere in the square, and the air was musky and hot from the smoke and residual heat.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;T</span><span style="font-weight: 400">he warriors and hunters breathed in smells of blood and sweat</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Dongye</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;searched for San and Biyeon. The two were mixed naturally amongst the people in the square.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">They were ordering their support staff&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">to do</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;‘trivial’ things. A smile appeared on&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Phew- I really don’t understand those people.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">They came to him at the most pressing and decisive moment of the battle. They told him to take over the operation and disappeared into the woods. He still didn’t understand why.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soon afterward, a series of magical situations occurred.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye was</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;surpri</span><span style="font-weight: 400">sed</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;to see these untrained people placed in the exact right place to counter the opponent’s every move</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. It was</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;as if the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;support staff</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;had made a promise&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">to meet the monsters and beasts at certain locations at specific time periods throughout the battle</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Furthermore,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">they were able to counter every attack with beautiful precision and efficacy</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400">he entire situation unfolded in such a sophisticated manner that he had to believe that they expected everything as if it was all choreographed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Among the numerous weird contraptions they had installed during the day for this evening's fateful battle, there was nothing unnecessary.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Without a single one of the countermeasures, it would’ve been a very difficult, uphill battle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The right w</span><span style="font-weight: 400">eapons were always within reach</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;and</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;the beasts fell into well-placed trenches, entangling themselves in the trenche</span><span style="font-weight: 400">s’&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">vines. They were further stabbed by stationary spears and burned in oil.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The most dangerous&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">point</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;during the battle was the attacks from the sky, but&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">even these flying creatures</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;were effectively countered with a new type of weapon, a torch attached to a long spear, another weapon that was made in advance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">At the moment of greatest peril, when the air beasts were closing in, they dispersed like magic, scattering into all four corners. At the same time, a group of ground-based monsters that had&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">rushed into the square</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;mysteriously began to disperse.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The beasts, who were oddly organized and moving menacingly, suddenly became wary of each other and rapidly ran away.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From then on, it wasn’t a battle but rather a massacre of an organized group of hunters against bewildered monsters and beasts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">There were enough weapons to fight, and the hunters were showing proper organizational movements. Dongye himself, according to the unfolding situation, just shouted out orders. The entire operation proceeded like&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">a master artist's painting</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately for&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, the Dong-Myung warriors showed&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">overwhelming</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;strength and achievement during this battle. It was to the point that the words ‘Of course, the Dong-Myung Clan!’ came out of every participant</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;mouth.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">In this more ‘liberal’ combat environment, the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;clansmen</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;were all able to take advantage of the right weapons and led the base camp's defense in all four corners.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I unexpectedly became a hero…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye laughed bitterly. Now, with the hunt over, all of the warriors and hunters gathered in the square and cheered with their fists clenched and raised high.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was the greatest tribute that could be offered to the person who organized and commanded this fantastic defense. It was also an honor to a hero who saved lives by leading others through a crisis. While receiving this adoration, Dongye’s looked for San and Biyeon again. He couldn’t find them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘They want me to finish up as well?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye was a seasoned leader who had led many large and small combat campaigns. He knew how to do this. He also guessed what those two people intended.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though it felt like he was taking undeserved credit, he was sure that they were correct in giving him this platform and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">recognition</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was because he received a clear message that they didn’t want to reveal themselves.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dongye slowly raised his right hand. With that small movement, the power and prestige of an Absolute Clan, the Dong</span><span style="font-weight: 400">-</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Myung Clan, could be felt. Thrilling energy spread like lightning throughout the square.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commotion settled down instantly. The eyes of these fervent hunters looked upwards towards the speaker.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am a warrior of the Dong-Myung Clan! Will you listen to my words?” his voice rang out</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;with authority</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone respond</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;almost at the same time. The sound seemed to come from a single source, not from a collection of individual voices.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is the end of the hunt today. But, as we’ve been through tonight, there will be many unexpected things happening on this hunt. Therefore, everyone here should&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">remain</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;vigilant. This is the end of today’s hunt. From now on, choose a leader for each group. I’ll tell you what you need to do here through your chosen leaders. First of all, we must tend to the injured quickly…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">square was</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;cleared up to some extent, and they were progressing into the organization phase, such as organizing the spoils and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">tending to</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;the wounded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The peoples’ expressions were bright as they constantly recalled the successful hunt.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;T</span><span style="font-weight: 400">hey&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">c</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ould now feast late&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">into the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;night with the game they had caught.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">True to them being</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;wild hunters, alcohol and meat were passed around in abundance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Although many of their colleagues had been lost throughout the day, they all understood that any hunt brought losses, so they had their own way of coping with death</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">San and Biyeon were sitting on a large boulder, away from the commotion. They lightly smiled as they watched Dongye busily take command.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">In front, quite far away from the two, one could see the backs of the specially commissioned support staff taking a break. The support staff were lined up in a row</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;and faced the</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;bonfire. They were taking a well-deserved break, having fulfilled their duty during the day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the Dong-Myung warriors were moving with steam coming off the tops of their heads and with their lips half-protruding out…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The specially commissioned support staff were very tired. However, they&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">felt</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;strong. With a slightly more experienced ‘we’ve gone through this already’&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">aura around them</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, they took a sweet break in front of the bonfire.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Before the tension was fully relieved after the battle, their captains had picked apart what they did incorrectly during the battl</span><span style="font-weight: 400">e&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">and how to improve&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">themselves in the future</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">In particular, the company commanders, Yuren and Yeria, were scolded to the point of tears.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After the battle was over, they were lectured on how dangerous it was to free themselves from tension.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Captain Dongye. He’s definitely a veteran. Very seasoned.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It's a good thing&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">that we have such a capable person</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400">That person we left in the forest…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Who do you think it was?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably someone who</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;h</span><span style="font-weight: 400">as</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;something to do with the goddess of hunting, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then, do you think there’ll be a second attack?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, I wouldn't do that if I were them,” he responded vaguely.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you think we’ve been… exposed?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Biyeon’s expression became a little darker.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Biyeon suddenly felt the back of her hand becoming warm. She raised her head and looked at&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">San</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. He was looking up at the sky with his thick gloves on the back of her hand.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">A round moon floated&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">beyond the bonfire</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;in the reddish</span><span style="font-weight: 400">-</span><span style="font-weight: 400">black sk</span><span style="font-weight: 400">y</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. A half-broken crescent moon slowly crawled past the night sky, much closer to them than the moon on Earth,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">as if proof</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;that it was a different world</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;sky.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Hey, don’t act so shocked… are you scared?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The man’s&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">playful</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;intentions echoed in her mind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[A little… I’m tired. I’m exhausted.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Biyeon swept her short hair back and responded with a complaint. He laughed, but the laughter was forced and bleak as if wr</span><span style="font-weight: 400">i</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">nging out water from a rag.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">His&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">face&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">visibly&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">darkened</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. He knew that it</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;would</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;be tough times ahead. Even in this relatively comfortable civilization, they had to live in a constant state of anxiety once again.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;Constant v</span><span style="font-weight: 400">igilance and a sense of crisis w</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ere a&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">harsh and unfair reality.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Would you like some alcohol…]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[That’ll probably help…]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Biyeon felt his hand falling off the back of her hand. The back of her hand felt empty. She felt a sense of loss. Her eyes were still thinly open, getting wet like dew at night. She kept looking forward.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, she turned her head. San’s warm hand, with his gloves off now, touched her right cheek.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He raised her face. In their hazy gazes, each other’s faces suddenly appeared larger. With eyes wide open, she found his eyes. It was a small search.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly, her heart beat violently. The world went crazy fast.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her energy,</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;which</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;was drained from exhaustion and fatigue just a moment ago, exploded with energy, circulating quickly throughout her body.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">dark,</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;gray world was suddenly painted in fascinating colors. Before long, she felt a light breath tingle her nose. It&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">was</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;a heavy coffee scent…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Biyeon closed her eyes. Her small mouth opened slightly…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Episode 2. Book 1: Exploration – Chapter 19</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Biyeon opened her eyes. It was dazzling&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">in this world</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, even at night. After blinking her eyes several times, she finally got her eyesight focused. She placed a finger on her lips.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It felt moist, soft, and warm to the touch. What just happened?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She suddenly turned her head. ‘He’ was still there. She was lying on his arm pillow while he was looking up at the night sky.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">His gaze seemed to be pointing somewhere in the sky. However, his sight didn’t seem to be focused on anything particular.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems as if he was deeply submerged in thought. He&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">exuded</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;confiden</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ce</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;in her eyes, as always.</span></p>
