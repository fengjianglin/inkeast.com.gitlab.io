 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-c876f9c5-7fff-3ac5-0831-1f3a2a7bbbbf"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin shifted his attention towards the people from the Daynight clan who were surrounding him. Every single last one of them was furious, as if they wanted to do nothing more than swallow him whole. There was only one exception, and that person was Madam Meilan. The middle-aged beauty did not have a hint of anger in her eyes. Instead, it seemed to be curiosity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was not bothered by the attitude of the people around him, and he simply had no time to bother with them. There were a boundless amount of rune lines sweeping down from the darkness of outer space at this moment. The Enlighters were starting to arrive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shenwu Continent’s space station shook, and everyone was affected by the arrival of the Enlighters. It was the kind of oppressive feeling that made those affected by it not even have the will to rebel. Many people from the Daynight clan rejoiced. “It’s the Elder! The Elder’s here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Madam Meilan’s expression changed, and her eyes suddenly held the same emotions as the other members of the Daynight clan towards Lu Yin: hatred and contempt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Lu Yin had been paying attention to her, then he would have been shocked to discover how quickly this woman’s attitude had changed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the jolt hit the entire space station, even the five sealing planets protecting Shenwu Continent trembled slightly. It then started to rain from inside the space station. Nightqueen Qiuyu had appeared. Her expression was as cold as ice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s expression changed at this moment. He immediately raised his arm to fire his gun. The next instant, Wendy Yushan waved her left hand and activated the Yu Secret Art. The bullet pierced through the rain and missed Nightqueen Qiuyu’s neck by mere centimeters before disappearing into the depths of outer space.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of a sudden, the rain stopped, and silence fell over the space station. Everyone who had just witnessed the scene was stunned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stood in front of Wendy Yushan and stared intently at the old woman, Nightqueen Qiuyu. The elder towered high above the space station in the vacuum of space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyu angrily glared at Lu Yin, and her aura distorted the sky. “Young one, you dare to attack me?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin kept his head high. “Senior, launching sneak attacks is not a style becoming of an Enlighter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyu was shocked. “How did you know that I was the one who launched that sneak attack, young one?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s expression turned cold. Of course he had not actually seen Nightqueen Qiuyu attack. Instead, he had simply observed the rune lines. When the rain had started falling within the space station, he had seen rune lines fill up the entire place, representing the effect that the attack had on the universe. The rune lines had shown him Nightqueen Qiuyu’s power, as the rainfall itself was enough to overpower Wendy Yushan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Wendy Yushan became injured to the point where she was unable to perform the Yu Secret Art, then Lu Yin would be essentially handicapped.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Greetings Elder!” The Daynight clan people spoke in unison as they bowed to Nightqueen Qiuyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyu snorted in acknowledgement. She then walked into the space station and looked at Lu Yin with curiosity. “Young one, your armor appears to have quite the impressive defensive abilities. Where did you acquire it?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m under no obligation to answer your questions. But let me remind you of something, elder: do not try to sneak attack me. If you try anything like that again, then this gun of mine will not show you any mercy,” Lu Yin said threateningly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyu sneered. “Threatening me with a mere gun—what a joke! Even if you use that secret technique to change the bullet’s trajectory, you still will not be able to hurt me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh really? There are more than a hundred attacks left in this gun. If I fire a dozen all at once, one or two shots are bound to hit you after being redirected by the secret technique. How many attacks would you be able to withstand, Elder?” Lu Yin retorted, not to be outdone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyu’s gaze turned icy cold, and she glared at Lu Yin. She had already felt the might of the gun’s attack, and she had realized that its attacks had a power level of over 250,000. If she were struck by something like that, then she was guaranteed to be severely injured. If she was struck in the head, then she might even die. It was no wonder why this child had been able to kill both <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Karthika</span> and Lei Long.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gun was not the most terrifying aspect of Lu Yin’s attacks. The most worrying part was Wendy Yushan’s secret technique that could divert the bullets. It almost guaranteed that an attack would hit its intended target, and that was what was most scary about this youth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Star energy shot up into the sky from the surface of Wendy Yushan’s body. The energy then morphed into a powerful force as the young woman stared intently at Nightqueen Qiuyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meilan Daynight and the others moved to surround Lu Yin and Wendy. The situation was about to escalate at any moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s face showed his determination, and he pointed the gun in a random direction, causing everyone who was watching him to freeze in terror.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrial rushed to smooth things over, and he respectfully offered up an apology.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A member of the Daynight clan walked over to Nightqueen Qiuyu and whispered something. After Nightqueen Qiuyu heard what was said, she looked at Lu Yin and asked, “Young one, what did you tell the person from Shenwu Continent?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had no reason to lie. “I told him that the Outerverse has been cut off.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyu flew into a rage. “Young one, Shenwu Continent has nothing to do with you! You dare to meddle in the affairs of the Daynight clan!?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder, what you say is wrong. Shenwu Continent has nothing to do with the Daynight clan either. This matter concerns those from Darkmist Weave. What sort of respect are you showing those powers from Darkmist Weave by making such a claim? Are you giving Elder Tyrial any face with those kinds of comments?” Lu Yin asked, deliberately sowing discord.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrial’s face suddenly changed. This matter had nothing to do with him! He was innocent and did not have the courage to interfere in anything. He quickly tried to laugh off Lu Yin’s words to Nightqueen Qiuyu by saying, “Elder Qiuyu, Lu Yin participated in a trial on Shenwu Continent in the past. He must have mentioned the matter in passing to a man he met during his time on the continent. He was not deliberately trying to foil your Daynight clan’s plans.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If it wasn’t deliberate, then why did he force you to send that man back to Shenwu Continent?” a man from the Daynight clan suddenly yelled. This man was a powerful Hunter, and he had seen for himself how Lu Yin had caused one of his clan member’s heads to explode with a single shot from that gun. The Hunter hated Lu Yin to his core.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrial explained, “That was out of fear that the man would be killed by all of you.” After he was done speaking, he whirled to look in Lu Yin’s direction. “Am I right, Student Lu?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin shrugged his shoulders. “Whatever you say.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrial was left speechless. What kind of an attitude was this? The young punk was actually not afraid of an Enlighter at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyu felt seething hatred for Lu Yin, and her rage had reached the point where her teeth had even started chattering. However, due to her fear of Lu Yin’s gun and Wendy Yushan’s secret technique, she knew that attempting another sneak attack would be pointless. She was not entirely sure if one of her attacks would be able to eliminate this brat, and she was destined for trouble if Lu Yin got an opportunity to fire his gun. The secret technique took less than a second to activate, and she was not confident that she could dodge the bullet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Each bullet that was fired from that gun carried a power level of over 250,000. Such a weapon was scary just to think about.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Madam Meilan walked over to Nightqueen Qiuyu and whispered something. Upon hearing what Meilan had to say, Nightqueen Qiuyu’s expression became apprehensive. She let out a gasp and quickly activated her gadget to contact someone while the remaining Daynight clan members kept their wary gazes trained on Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin did not lower his guard for even a moment. When confronting an Enlighter, any carelessness on his part might cause not only himself to be injured, but also Wendy Yushan. The fact that she possessed a secret technique might be enough to save her life, but that did not negate the possibility that she might become seriously injured.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a while, Nightqueen Qiuyu dismissed the Daynight clan members. She stared at Lu Yin in a threatening manner and said, “Kid, do not be so wild in your actions. Not even the Ten Arbiters were as wild as you when they were just Limiteers.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s mouth twitched. “When the Ten Arbiters were Limiteers, were they able to kill Enlighters?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyu became furious; this brat’s arrogance was infuriating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Madam Meilan rushed over and quietly said something, and only then did Nightqueen Qiuyu’s anger dissipate. She quietly growled, “Kid, when it is time to depart, you should take your leave.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin raised a brow. Even though he had not been able to hear what Madam Meilan had said to Nightqueen Qiuyu, he had a feeling that something big was about to happen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Madam Meilan looked at Lu Yin with a smile on her face and said, “Student Lu, the Elder will not pursue your previous offences, but please leave. You are not welcome here.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin cocked a brow and was about to speak, but before he could even open his mouth, the Ghost Monkey interjected. “Seventh Bro, leave! Even I can feel that something is wrong. If Enlighters are given enough time to prepare, then you won’t be able to kill them. She doesn’t have any way to kill you right now, but she still has her own ways of putting up a decent fight against you. Besides, there’re also Hunters here. You’ve put up a brave front thus far, but there is no use in continuing this charade. Get out of here while you still can.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin agreed with the monkey’s assessment of the situation. Too many variables could spring up if he stayed around. “It seems that we’re not welcome here. Since that’s the case, we’ll bid you all farewell.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyu did not even look at Lu Yin again, but she did allow him to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Madam Meilan stared in astonishment as Lu Yin left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrial let out a sigh of relief, feeling lucky that a fight had not broken out. However, he still felt that it was a shame that Lu Yin hadn’t been killed by Nightqueen Qiuyu. Lu Yin’s intuition had been correct—Tyrial had indeed been stalling to give Nightqueen Qiuyu enough time to arrive at the space station. That had been his only goal while conversing with Lu Yin. The youth’s terrifying talent as well as his status as the strongest Limiteer in the Universe had caused the Hunter to feel jealous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was an absolute shame that things had ended the way they had, but Lu Yin just had too many tricks up his sleeve.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After leaving Shenwu Continent’s space station, both Wendy Yushan and Lu Yin took a separate spacecraft and started heading towards the Great Yu Empire. At this time, Lu Yin was finally able to heave a sigh of relief. No matter where he looked, there was no sign of a threatening number of rune lines.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan called Lu Yin. “Is there someone whom you care about on Shenwu Continent? Who is it?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin paused to think for a moment. “Someone I’ve agreed to spend my life with.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan’s eyes flickered. “A woman?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a stupid question!” Lu Yin blurted out in spite of himself. He immediately regretted his words, and he hurried to apologize. “I’m sorry, Wendy. That comment wasn’t meant for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan casually replied, “It really was a stupid question. You were right.” After she finished speaking, she ended the call.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stared hazily at his gadget. Anyone with a sliver of emotional quotient could sense that Wendy was angry. Was she upset because he had told her she asked a stupid question? He had already apologized, but she was still angry. Women could be so difficult at times.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he looked behind at Shenwu Continent’s space station, Lu Yin knew that his next trip to the continent would likely be a lengthy stay. He also knew that things would be much different when he returned, as he wanted to grasp the power to both determine his own destiny as well as Ming Yan’s.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After making sure that Lu Yin had left, Nightqueen Qiuyu emerged from the void. She wanted to attack the five sealing planets before news of the Outerverse being isolated spread across the continent. This had been the reminder that Madam Meilan had whispered to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The five sealing planets had indeed stopped Enlighters before; however, that had been due to the seal being reinforced by Ming Zhaotian and the others. But now, Shenwu Continent was internally divided with Ming Zhaotian being restrained by Ming Zhaoshu. As long as Ming Zhaoshu was willing to work with the Daynight clan, then Ming Zhaotian would not dare to show up at the five sealing planets. This was their only chance, since if news that the Outerverse had been isolated was released, then Ming Zhaoshu would not want to cooperate with them any further.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you saying that you sent that man to an isolated island outside of Shenwu Continent?” Nightqueen Qiuyu asked unsympathetically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind her, Tyrial replied respectfully, “Yes, to an abandoned, isolated island. Getting back to Shenwu Continent from that island will take him at least three days.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Three days.” Nightqueen Qiuyu raised her head. This meant that she had to break through the &nbsp;five sealing planets within three days, or else new variables would enter the equation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon after, the entirety of Shenwu Continent trembled. The five sealing planets were being attacked by Nightqueen Qiuyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Martial King Ming Zhaotian looked up with an agonized expression on his face. With one leap, he prepared to go to the five sealing planets. However, he was stopped by someone else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ming Zhaoshu, if the five sealing planets are breached, then you will have no room for negotiation!” Ming Zhaotian cried out sharply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the void, Ming Zhaoshu’s voice echoed out, despite the fact that he was very far away. His voice traveled all the way to the imperial capital. “There is no need for you to worry about such matters, my royal brother.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Atop the four peaks that surrounded the Imperial Capital, four Martial Sovereigns all acted at the same time to hold Ming Zhaoshu back. However, they were all pushed aside by Ming Zhaoshu’s forcefield. This power was enough for Ming Zhaoshu to contend directly against Ming Zhaotian, much less some ordinary Martial Sovereign realm cultivators.</span></p>
