That one glance was enough for him to determine the occupant’s strength, and it was someone weaker.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that spacecraft was <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Sleeping Prince</span>, who was sleeping at that moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan moved in front of Nightking Gu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One was ranked eighteenth while the other was ranked fifteenth. It would seem like the difference was not that great, but Lu Yin’s eyes could see the disparity as Nightking Gu’s amount of rune lines clearly surpassed Wendy Yushan’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no nonsense exchanged, and Nightking Gu promptly raised his skull-like visage. His sunken eyes sparkled coldly, but then he suddenly vanished, only to reappear right before Wendy Yushan. He punched out, while at the same time, a grey-white layer of air covered him. This was something that Lu Yin had seen before; this was the Nightking’s Body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan sliced out with her sword, and the tip managed to penetrate his bone to some degree. The might of Ten-Thousand Swords in One was enough to slice the Nightking's Body apart, but the blade drew no blood. On the contrary, Wendy Yushan was sent crashing into the mountain range by Nightking Gu’s punch, stopping at some unknown depth underground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless people were stunned, as Wendy Yushan had sliced Zhanbing Daynight apart, showcasing the formidable power of her sword. However, even such a blade was ineffective against Nightking Gu. Her attack could not be deemed completely ineffective as she had broken through Nightking Gu’s defense, but it had not been enough to seriously harm him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin appeared in front Nightking Gu by using Flash Step and then swatted a palm at the Explorer. Nightking Gu noticed Lu Yin, but he did not bother dodging. Instead, he allowed Lu Yin to strike him. “Thirty Stacks, Seventyfold Shockwave Palm.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ground split open as the two young men sank underground together. Lu Yin’s pupils shrank as he had discovered that the power of his palm attack was not enough to break through the Nightking's Body. In fact, it had been completely ineffective.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Gu turned and stared at Lu Yin with gloomy eyes. He then lunged out with his left hand without any warning. Lu Yin didn’t dare to allow himself to be grabbed, and he hurriedly retreated. However, Nightking Gu’s speed was not slow either, as no physically oriented cultivation technique would be slow. Nightking Gu hounded Lu Yin along his path of retreat. All the while, his fist vibrated in a way that damaged space, striking Lu Yin through the vibrations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin only felt his chest be struck, and just as he was about to use his Fatesand, sword qi swept up from beneath his feet, aimed straight at Nightking Gu. The Nightking’s fist conveniently smashed downwards and collided against the sword qi instead, causing a shockwave to sweep out in all directions, shaking the void as well. Lightning-like spatial cracks extended in all directions, and a large crater appeared where Nightking Gu had struck the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan leaped up and stood in front of Lu Yin as she solemnly looked at Nightking Gu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Gu stood back up. His skull-like face was enough to send chills running down one’s spine.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t intervene. You can’t handle his attacks,” Wendy Yushan said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked at her seriously. “You definitely can</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">not</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;use that. At worst, we’ll give him the mountain range. The Sea King's Dome can’t blame us for not being able to defend this mountain range since we’ve already worked together.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan nodded, and her sword spun around before slicing towards Nightking Gu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Gu’s body itself distorted the void. He obviously had no muscles, but he gave off a feeling of unparalleled strength that was enough to even make Wendy Yushan’s sword tip grow sluggish.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Gu did not even dodge Wendy Yushan’s sword. He allowed it to stab into his body again before he slammed out with another palm. Wendy Yushan’s expression changed as palm struck her abdomen, causing her to spit out a mouthful of blood as she was flung into the distance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Gu ferociously charged after her with another fist, ready to strike again. Wendy Yushan glared at him coldly as she forcefully contorted her body to evade Nightking Gu’s attack. She struck out and stabbed her sword into Nightking Gu’s body again, and this time, fresh blood flowed down the blade, proving that she had injured him this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he paid no attention to the wound and grabbed the edge of the blade with his hand, causing the sword to slice into his palm while his other hand moved forward to strike at Wendy’s forehead. If his attack connected, then Wendy Yushan would definitely die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin appeared at this crucial moment and kicked out with a foot wrapped in six-lined battle force. The enormous strength of this kick distracted Nightking Gu, and he was forced to redirect his hand away from Wendy’s head to block Lu Yin’s attack. Lu Yin’s thigh twisted, and there was a crack as his bone snapped and his battle force collapsed. However, the force of his kick had also forced Nightking Gu to take two steps back, allowing Wendy Yushan to escape from her crisis.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin crashed deep into the ground with a bang, his right leg bent at a strange angle that sent intense pain jolting through his body. He gritted his teeth and endured the agony as he watched Wendy Yushan break free from her crisis. Only then was he able to relax. Still, the pain from his ruined leg washed over him in waves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since stepping on the path of cultivation, Lu Yin had rarely lost out when it came to physical strength. His encounter with Nightking Gu at this time had been a struggle of physical strength, but he hadn’t even been able to really retaliate. This was a super expert, someone ranked fifteenth on the Top 100 Rankings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, it was just a bent right leg, and he could quickly heal from this sort of injury. Lu Yin touched his cosmic ring, as it seemed that it was time for him to rely on external help once again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan appeared beside Lu Yin and bent down to press her hand against Lu Yin’s leg.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was puzzled. “What’s the matter? It’s not that serious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan did not answer him, and he saw that fresh blood was dripping from her lips and that her face was serious. In the next moment, her palm started to give off a faint, hazy halo, and Lu Yin’s right leg immediately stopped hurting and returned to normal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an innate gift of healing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he had been in East San Dios, Lu Yin had guessed that Wendy Yushan most likely had some innate gift, as she was firmly placed within the top twenty, but he had never imagined that she would have an innate gift of healing. This sort of innate gift appeared in less than one person in 10,000, and that was when considering cultivators with innate gifts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The functionality of healing did not need to be elaborated on. When Wendy Yushan displayed her innate gift of healing, the various major forces above the planet turned green with envy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a battle, if a cultivator with the innate gift of healing was present, then the number of casualties would drastically decrease for that side, and their odds of victory would soar. Moreover, this particular cultivator with an innate gift of healing was also not weak in any way.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can actually heal!” Lu Yin exclaimed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan stood up. “Alright, try to move it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin got up, shook his right leg slightly, and then looked at her in deep appreciation. “I found it strange to see that there was such a disparity between you and him, but if your innate gift of healing is added into the mix, then the disparity is substantially reduced. We can smother him to death.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan’s face turned solemn as she turned towards Nightking Gu. “We can’t smother him to death. He’s too powerful, and all of the injuries that I gave him only happened because he didn’t need to dodge them. If he starts fighting seriously, then I might not be able to even hit him.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What about working with me?” Lu Yin asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan clenched the hilt of her sword. “Don’t intervene. He’s not an opponent you can handle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In front of them, Nightking Gu’s cold eyes stared at Lu Yin, and he clenched his hand; the blood had already congealed. His brows rose up. This woman was rather troublesome, so he would need to end this battle quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After thinking about it, Nightking Gu immediately dashed towards Wendy Yushan as a spiral-like air flow appeared around his body. Wendy Yushan’s expression immediately changed, and she sliced out with her long sword. The tip of the sword was stopped by the airflow, and when it made contact with Nightking Gu, it was no longer able to break through his Nightking's Body. Nightking Gu was clearly afraid of Wendy Yushan’s innate gift, so he had started taking the battle seriously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan’s strike was fruitless. She followed up by instinctively blocking her front, and Nightking Gu’s fist landed on the tip of her sword and bent the blade. The force continued traveling through the sword and shook Wendy to her core, causing her to become severely injured again as she flew into the distance like a meteor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Gu continued charging at her, next appearing above her head. He clasped both of his hands together and smashed down ruthlessly, unwilling to give Wendy Yushan any time to recover.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Wendy Yushan’s position in the top twenty also meant that she was no pushover. Although it seemed like Nightking Gu’s previous strike had been critical, Wendy Yushan had managed to withstand it, and she dodged to the side now. Nightking Gu’s strike missed, and this time, he was the one blasted into the ground as the void distorted again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two started moving faster and faster, and sword qi constantly clashed against the wind from a fist. The void in the surrounding region completely collapsed from the battle, shocking countless onlookers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin narrowed his eyes and filled them with star energy. Although others may not be able to see the battle, he could clearly see it. At the start, Wendy Yushan had been attacking more frequently, but now, she had switched to a defensive posture, and he could tell that she could almost not bear it any longer. Nightking Gu’s relentless attacks didn’t give her any chances to treat herself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he watched Wendy Yushan’s injuries grow more serious, Lu Yin’s eyes widened, and the Giant Emperor’s third eye appeared in his left hand as he unleashed his domain. He stared closely at the two and then used Flash Step to charge in between them. He merged his three grains of Fatesand into one and used the clod of dirt to block the attack before it struck his body. The dirt happened to be right in the path of Nightking Gu’s attack that was aimed at Wendy Yushan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a loud sound as a giant spatial crack swept sideways and tore through the void. Nightking Gu’s strike had landed on the combined Fatesand, and the Fatesand had completely blocked it. The next instant, Wendy Yushan’s sword stabbed into Nightking Gu’s body, and she gave him another piercing injury as fresh blood dripped off the tip of the sword. The scarlet color was rather eye-catching.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone stared at the scene in disbelief, as Lu Yin had actually managed to defend against Nightking Gu’s punch. Not only was Nightking Gu himself astonished, but Wendy Yushan was also staring at Lu Yin in shock, and then she looked at the soil.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What… was that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Previously, when the Fatesand around Lu Yin’s heart had awakened, it had been strong enough to help Lu Yin withstand Feng Mo’s attack. Although it was just a casual strike, Feng Mo was still a genuine Hunter. With the defensive ability of just one grain of Fatesand, Lu Yin estimated that the dirt clod could withstand a blow from powerhouses ranked around fiftieth on the Top 100 Rankings. Three combined into one made it possible for him to withstand Nightking Gu’s punch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a loud explosion, the three separated. Nightking Gu took a dozen steps back as he held his abdomen, shock appearing in his eyes for the first time in this battle. He stared at the dirt clods in front of Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What is that thing?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;It had actually managed to defend against his punch.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Few were able to recognize Fatesand, and not even Nightking Gu or Wendy Yushan knew what it was, and they were two elites of the younger generation. Only the Enlighters in space, and even then, only the extraordinary ones, could recognize the dirt.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Ren was the first, and he was stunned. How could this kid have Fatesand? That was a valuable treasure of the universe, and it was difficult for even the Sea King's Dome to get a hold of it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyu was similarly surprised. “It’s Fatesand! The Sea King actually gave him such a valuable thing. It looks like he’s determined to make this child his son-in-law.” Evidently, Nightqueen Qiuyu had misunderstood the situation, though she was not the only one. The other Enlighters who were able to recognize the Fatesand all similarly guessed that the Sea King had given it to Lu Yin, as it was impossible for Lu Yin to have gotten it otherwise.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not all of the Enlighters were able to recognize it, as Fatesand was just too rare, and even some of the major powers in the Innerverse did not have access to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the surface of Planet Pyrolyte, Wendy Yushan was puzzled as she looked at the soil clod in front of them that had just blocked the attack. “What’s that?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fatesand. It’s an ultimate treasure that can block the attacks of the guy in front of us. We’ll work together: I’ll defend while you attack. We’ll be able to delay him and then kill him.” Lu Yin gritted through clenched teeth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan’s eyes flashed, and she nodded. “Alright.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, under countless eyes, Lu Yin grabbed Wendy Yushan’s waist and charged towards Nightking Gu. Wendy Yushan did not pull away. Although it felt unnatural, she allowed Lu Yin to embrace her as she slashed out at Nightking Gu.</span></p>
