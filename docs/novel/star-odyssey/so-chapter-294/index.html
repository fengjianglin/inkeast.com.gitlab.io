 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

This was the first time she had ever stood face to face with him, as all of their previous communication had been done through video calls. Right now, she finally understood what this person from the Zishan family was like. He was extremely tyrannical, ruthless, and very different from what she had imagined. He was also unreasonably powerful to the point where even Explorers were no match for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since the Yushan family is in trouble, and Princess Wendy is nowhere in sight though probably alive, I, King Zishan Lu Yin, shall become the interim emperor. Do any of you object?” Lu Yin matter-of-factly declared. He disliked beating around the bush and so spoke very directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The result was obvious. The fact that Huo Qingshan and the other two had appeared was an answer in and of itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Fifth Imperial Squadron fully supports King Zishan,” Huo Qingshan answered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Ninth Imperial Squadron fully supports King Zishan,” Rocky Auna answered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Thirteenth Imperial Squadron fully supports King Zishan,” Liuying Zishan answered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Twelfth Imperial Squadron fully supports King Zishan.” Ban Jiu, who had arrived at some point, also added in his support.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked up, with a tired face. “Henceforth, I am both King Zishan as well as… the Royal Regent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a long time now, it was impossible to rule as emperor just by simply ascending to the throne. Lu Yin could hold a certain amount of power since he had the ring of authority and the position of King Zishan. However, it was impossible for him to actually become the emperor. He did not have the right to inherit the throne; only Wendy Yushan currently had that right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, he could not touch the throne at this moment. Instead, he would manage the Great Yu Empire as the Royal Regent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Majesty, the empire is currently embroiled with both internal and external problems. Please make some decisions about this as soon as possible.” The very next day, a minister mentioned this matter during a morning meeting. It was a fact that Lu Yin had become the Royal Regent since he had obtained the support of the Thirteen Imperial Squadrons, the ring of authority, and the support of the Zishan’s clan’s former subordinates. Thus, he had naturally taken over these meetings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin sat below the emperor’s throne and was the only one who was seated in the main hall. After hearing what the ministers had to say, Lu Yin took a look at his gadget. “I have my plans.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ministers exchanged looks, but remained silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The extended family members’ fight for the throne was the main reason why Zenyu Star was in its current state of chaos. Now that the relatives have all been wiped out, the empire had the bandwidth to focus on reclaiming its lost territory and repulsing the Ross Empire. As the Royal Regent, Lu Yin should have been making arrangements to handle these matters, but he had done nothing so far. It was very confusing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rocky Auna glanced at Lu Yin, and when he saw that Lu Yin was continuously checking his gadget, Rocky Auna frowned; Lu Yin really was too young. These meetings were very solemn occasions, and this was not the time for the Royal Regent to be checking his gadget. Even Dorren Yushan and Undying Yushan had never done anything like this in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ministers also felt rather uncomfortable. If this wasn’t Lu Yin’s first time attending a meeting as Royal Regent, then their tongues would have immediately started wagging.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hall lapsed into a momentary silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monkey finally could not hold it in any longer. “The ministers keep looking at you like you’re stupid, Seventh Bro! Aren’t you afraid that they’ll scold you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s gaze swept downwards. There were only a third of the original ministers remaining. Bailey was present, but only four of the thirteen captains were present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t pay them any mind. They don’t think much of me right now, and anything I do will be considered pointless to them. Just wait—the outcome will become clear quite soon,” Lu Yin replied, seemingly talking to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The secretary of the Empire, Garope, could no longer restrain himself. He stood up and exclaimed, “My lord, this meeting is not a time for you to be on your gadget! Please focus on the matters of the empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin glanced at <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Garope</span>. “Tell me this, Lord <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Garope</span>. What is the most important problem the empire should be focusing on right now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That would be the Ross Empire’s war against us. I’m sure that you aren’t treating this as a mere joke. Right, my lord?” <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Garope</span> briskly responded, obviously enraged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin chuckled. “Exactly. I’m taking care of it right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was shocked by his response.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Qingshan’s eyes lit up. “Could you please clarify what you mean by this, Your Majesty? The Ross Empire is not a joke. You do hold a special position, so the Ross Empire cannot do much to you yourself, but you holding such a high position doesn’t necessarily mean you have corresponding influence.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, Lu Yin’s gadget beeped, and his face lit up. With a loud chuckle, he said, “Just in time.” As he spoke, he tapped on his gadget’s display. “Please read this out, Lord <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Garope</span>.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Garope</span> <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">examined the screen that was shown on Lu Yin’s gadget, and his eyes widened as he read out, “‘The Spirit Seal Flowzone’s Watermoon Villa has officially denounced the Ross Empire’s campaign against the Outerverse’s Great Yu Empire. Furthermore, they have stated that the Innerverse should not meddle in the matters of the Outerverse. The Ross Empire has used military force to suppress the Great Yu Empire, resulting in the loss of countless lives.

He stared at Lu Yin in disbelief, and everyone else was just as astonished as they all looked at the Royal Regent. “Your Majesty, this…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin chuckled. “It’s just that others are also annoyed about this situation. The universe should be at peace and the Innerverse shouldn’t be bullying the Outerverse, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course not, but many of the ministers were confused. It was very normal for organisations from the Innerverse to bully or even destroy organisations from the Outerverse. Peace in the universe? When had that ever existed? That claim was utter crap. Also, these two notices were worded exactly the same, and the only difference between them were the names. Was it possible that Lu Yin had written this himself? Many were suspicious that this was actually what had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin grinned. He had obviously written it himself and then collected on two oaths to get these notices published. It was impossible to use the oaths to force the Watermoon Villa or the Xun Family to wage war against the Ross Empire, but sending a warning wasn’t a problem. When a couple more notices also popped up, the Ross Empire would become terrified. While they were confident that these organizations wouldn’t actually intervene, they would still nonetheless have to stop the war after taking everything into consideration. This was because these two identical notices from powerful organizations were a clear indication that someone was trying to make their stance known, and it also meant that this person was more than what they seemed. The Ross Empire would surely be afraid of the possible consequences, because the universe was truly mysterious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s gadget beeped again, indicating that another notice had been published. “The Outerverse’s Bard Weave’s Saiki Palace has officially denounced the Ross Empire’s campaign against the Outerverse’s Great Yu Empire. Furthermore, they have stated that the Innerverse should not meddle in the matters of the Outerverse. The Ross Empire has used military force to suppress the Great Yu Empire, resulting in the revolting loss of countless lives. The Saiki Palace hereby officially warns the Ross Empire and asks it to halt its campaign and allow the universe to return to peace.’”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This notice was worded slightly differently since the Saiki Palace was an organization from the Outerverse. However, its contents were very surprising since it included the phrase “revolting.” With this, the Ross Empire would have no choice but to consider the possibility of several different Outerverse organizations banding together against them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, even more notices appeared, some from Innerverse organizations and others from Outerverse organizations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An hour later, all of the ministers in the hall were thoroughly stunned. A total of thirteen warning letters from thirteen different organizations had been posted, with each one addressed to the Ross Empire. The organizations came from both parts of the Human Domain, and some of them were no weaker than the Ross Empire. With so many of these notices being published, the Ross Empire would definitely need to consider withdrawing its troops if its leaders weren’t stupid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ministers looked up at Lu Yin, who was sitting idly next to the throne. For the first time, they had a feeling that this young Royal Regent should not be underestimated. He had single-handedly resolved this war that had affected the entire Frostwave Weave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin kept looking at his gadget with a smile on his face, not minding the fact that all of the ministers were looking at him strangely. Nobody voiced any objections at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Garope</span> <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">bowed low. “Please forgive me for my earlier actions, Your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked up. “There’s no need for that. You did well.” After saying that, he finally put his gadget down. He stood up, and his expression turned stern. “The Ross Empire will probably try to end the war. But regardless of what conditions they put forth, reject everything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of the ministers below hastily asked, “What if the Ross Empire demands compensation for the war?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Like I said, reject everything.” Lu Yin’s voice was cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The minister was startled by the curt response and quickly bowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This war was just a farce. We, the Great Yu Empire, have suffered the worst damage, and I’m already being benevolent by not demanding compensation from them. They are now the ones in the passive position. Besides, with those thirteen warning letters, they won’t want this war to wage on for any longer,” Lu Yin said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rest acknowledged his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Spread the news, announcing that the Great Yu Empire thanks everyone for their help. Say that the peace of the universe is what we of the Great Yu Empire value above all and that we hope to create a peaceful relationship with everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bring the residents that fled from Zenyu Star back and conduct a census of the population.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Lu Yin had not managed to stop the war, then his orders would not have been carried out even if he had held a higher position. However, things were different now. He had managed to avert the empire’s crisis with a wave of his hand, thus gaining the reputation of being mysterious, powerful, and worthy of respect. Nobody dared to go against any of his orders anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The meeting continued for a record-breaking three hours, which rarely happened during meetings between the Great Yu Empire’s upper echelons. While everyone was leaving afterwards, Lu Yin asked Ban Jiu to stay behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Qingshan was very confused. Ban Jiu and Lu Yin had virtually never interacted in the past, but this person had been asked to stay behind for some reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ban Jiu also found this request very surprising. He wondered if it had something to do with Sicar, but that didn’t seem very likely to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I hear that you have some understanding of technology, Captain Ban Jiu. I have a question for you.” Lu Yin then walked closer to him and whispered, “If I want to transfer an important document into the Ross Empire, is it possible to do it without letting them discover it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ban Jiu’s eyes lit up, and he looked at Lu Yin in shock. “You mean…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin handed him a document. “Send this over to the Ross Empire and make sure that they don’t find out where it’s from. Can you do that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ban Jiu took a look at it, and his expression immediately changed. “This is information regarding the military matters of the empire?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin merely stared at Ban Jiu.</span></p>

This youth before him stood above tens of thousands of people, and there was no need for him to betray them. Besides, with his position, there was no need to flatter the Ross Empire either. “Why are you sending this to the Ross Empire, Your Majesty?”</span></p>
