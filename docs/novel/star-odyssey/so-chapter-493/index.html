 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97ecd401-7fff-2629-a43d-0ffd3bb055c5"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">More than ten attacks swept across the sky, almost causing the two spacecraft to crash. “Are you trying to die? You actually dare to land right in the middle of a battlefield? Do you think that you are Ling Que?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ah Fan gritted his teeth and blood dripped from the corners of his lip as he fell to the ground and onto the clothes of the girl he was protecting. The girl was in despair; she knew that she was about to die. If she had known that it would be like this, she would not have come and would have instead stayed at Shangwu Academy for a bit longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She looked at Ah Fan who was protecting her. She had actually mocked him for losing their academy’s only teleportation stone, and yet, when they were at the end of their rope, he was the only person protecting her. Life was unpredictable, and if she didn’t die at this place, she swore to pay him back for this protection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The numerous attacks actually didn’t destroy the two spacecraft, and one of spacecraft’s hatches opened while the vessel was still in midair. A youth appeared, and he easily received all of the attacks himself in order to allow the second spacecraft to land safely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Across the mountain range, many of the people were surprised to see one person handle so many attacks on his own. He was clearly very powerful, but that would just invite misfortune upon him. In chaotic battlefields like these, everyone would target the most powerful participants.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stood firm atop the mountain range and looked at the dark-red soil. There were no plants in this area, but he had been surrounded by a bunch of red-eyed Limiteers who immediately began attacking him without exchanging any words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked around and decided that he shouldn’t put on too impressive of a performance. Thus, he used only his Shockwave Palm and Spacerender Palm techniques, which were two battle techniques that he had learned on Earth. Neither of them required any star energy, so they were very appropriate for a planet that was completely devoid of star energy like Planet Pyrolyte.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He raised a hand: Spacerender Palm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a bang, the closest Limiteer to Lu Yin was sent flying back as the armor on his body shattered to pieces. Blood burst forth from the Limiteer’s mouth, but he was already dead.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene shocked all of the surrounding people, and everyone’s movements turned sluggish at that moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin grinned; that attack had still been too strong, so he needed to tone it down even more!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, the hatch of the other spacecraft opened, and Hai Qiqi excitedly rushed out while wielding a blade. She let out a shout as her figure flitted about the battlefield. She easily dodged the attacks aimed at her, but after evading one she patted her chest and glared at an attacker. “Stupid black bear, that was too scary!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man who had hacked at Hai Qiqi was the same one who had severely injured Ah Fan. Hai Qiqi had coincidentally landed nearby, and the crater caused by the spacecraft’s crash landing had almost reached Ah Fan’s feet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stupid brat, you’re looking to die!” The man raised his blade and slashed at her again while another man behind him attacked Ah Fan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi’s eyes turned sharp when she glanced at Ah Fan and the girl he was protecting. In an instant, she understood what was going on; there was a pitiful couple here at death’s door. As the benevolent princess of the Sea King’s Dome, Hai Qiqi believed that she carried the responsibility to protect such beautiful relationships.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man’s blade only struck air; Hai Qiqi had disappeared from in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind them, Ah Fan had closed his eyes in despair. But instead of death, he was met with a mocking voice. “Hey! You should be hugging your wife before you die. What’s this supposed to be?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ah Fan’s eyes went wide, and he looked at Hai Qiqi.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wife?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;He was completely confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cultivator with two-lined battle force collapsed in the distance, and Ah Fan’s eyes went even wider, as he could not understand how Hai Qiqi had done such a thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the man who had attacked Hai Qiqi simply turned around and fled. Ah Fan might not have seen what had happened, but this man had, which was why he immediately tried to escape. He knew that he was not this woman’s opponent; she was just too scary! He hadn’t even clearly seen how fast she had moved! She had to be the heir of some great power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin watched on from a distance, but then he withdrew his gaze. It seemed that there was no need to worry about Hai Qiqi. With her strength, she was no slower than him when he used Flash Step. Her safety was basically guaranteed through just her speed alone, so long as she didn’t encounter anyone on Mu Rong’s level.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people around Lu Yin exchanged glances as they felt that he was distracted. Then, they attacked in unison. Lu Yin finally acted, and he moved both of his arms. The people surrounding him were only able to see phantom images of his two arms, and each one of them was blown away by an irresistible force. The area within a hundred meters of Lu Yin had been instantly cleared out, which showed just how impressive his strength was. Still, it wasn’t completely overwhelming since there were a few people who didn’t die from his attack. It seemed like his speed was astounding, but the power behind his attacks was not quite as high.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, to these Limiteers from the smaller flowzones, his attacks were already overwhelming. Many instinctively backed away. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where are those from Northline Flowzone?” Lu Yin shouted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Gang was just about to escape when he heard Lu Yin’s words, which caused his eyes to brighten. “Here! We’re here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin turned around and saw Northgate Gang, which caused him to involuntarily frown. This person was detestable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Northgate Gang saw Lu Yin frown, his heart skipped a beat.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not good, is he not an expert who was sent by Northline Flowzone? Could he have some kind of grudge against us?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Gang’s knees bent as he prepared to use his fastest speed to escape, but Lu Yin’s next words made his apprehension disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This mountain range will now belong to Northline Flowzone. Everyone else can leave now,” Lu Yin announced in a loud voice. He would not touch any of the areas considered important by the great powers, but the fact that this small mountain range had been contested by Northline Flowzone indicated that the major organizations did not care about it. Lu Yin did not mind helping Northline Flowzone control such an inconsequential area, and it could be considered as him repaying the favor to them. With this, he would be able to leave and search for Zhuo Daynight.</span></p>

However, when they recalled the speed of Lu Yin’s attack, they felt forced to retreat, especially since they had clearly seen that he had only used Shockwave Palm and had not displayed any battle techniques. This meant that Lu Yin had not used all of his strength yet, and it was not worth it to confront such a person for this place that only had a small amount of pyrolyte.</span></p>

Shouldn’t you treat her?”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi wanted to retort, but then she thought better of it and pouted instead. “Alright, Seventh.

I’ll supervise here for a day before leaving.”</span></p>

If it hadn’t been for this person’s foolish mistake, then Northgate Gang would have been able to escape from the battle instead of nearly losing his life in this place. Hence, he found Ah Fan exceptionally odious right now, and despite knowing that Ah Fan’s condition was quite severe, Northgate Gang still made him start mining.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group from Northline Flowzone all treated Northgate Gang as their leader, and every action was dictated by him. Ah Fan could only obey, or else he would be reprimanded, while the girl whom Ah Fan had rescued looked on with worry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi finally could not take it anymore. “Thumbtack!

I don’t know your name, so I only called you ‘thumbtack’ because you look like one. What’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd around them desperately stifled their laughter.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t care.” Hai Qiqi rolled her eyes in response.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi pursed her lips. “Nothing. Just watching you play around and act like the boss.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Gang was about to open his mouth and berate her, but he forcefully endured her words. He snorted and turned to leave, but he no longer forced Ah Fan to mine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ah Fan’s body trembled as he leaned against the mountainside, and the girl he had rescued hurried over to support him. She looked appreciatively at Hai Qiqi and smiled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi just shrugged.</span></p>

The brat had a good heart. Lu Yin had also wanted to help Ah Fan, but Hai Qiqi had moved first. However, Ah Fan was supposed to be at San Dios, yet he had shown up at this place. It seemed that pyrolyte was extremely important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin did not know if Zhuo Daynight was alive or where she might be if she was. Thus, he was not in a hurry to look for her. Instead, he tried to learn about where Pyrolyte Mountain was located so that he could head in that direction and search for some clues and perhaps conveniently repay his debt. It wouldn’t be easy to find Zhuo Daynight, so there was no need to rush things.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps he should first look for the Daynight clan.</span></p>

The area didn’t hold very much pyrolyte ore, so after those minor powers were repelled, it became unlikely for anyone else to come and try to take control of the mountain range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s performance had intimidated all the smaller organizations away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One day later, Lu Yin took Hai Qiqi with him, and they left under the complicated gazes of Northgate Gang and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Gang hated the two of them, but he was also forced to rely on them. Now that they had left, he could only hope that no strong opponents would appear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had verified the location of Pyrolyte Mountain, and it would take him a few days of travel to reach it from his current position. He took Hai Qiqi along with him, and he also asked Northgate Gang for a pyrolyte detector.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some days later, Pyrolyte Mountain finally became visible. Lu Yin wanted to avoid being discovered by Mu Rong, so he did not get too close to the mountain. Instead, he maintained a certain distance as he circled around the mountain one time, but he was not able to find Zhuo Daynight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He believed that she would not be hiding in an area where Mu Rong’s domain could detect her, as if she had, she would already be dead.</span></p>
