Three become one for the Fifth Sword.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What did you say?” Hai Qiqi was lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yōu Ye'er shook her head. “Nothing. Do you think that he can take the Fifth Sword?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi rolled her eyes. “I don’t know.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the base of the mountain range, Lu Yin’s face grew solemn. He could sense Liu Shaoqiu’s forcefield as well as the Fifth Sword’s terrifying strength that merged everything into one entity. This sharpness was something that was incomparable to anything from before, and it was already causing spatial cracks to appear in the void. In Lu Yin’s eyes, Liu Shaoqiu had already become a sword, and Lu Yin could see countless spatial cracks extending out from the swordsman’s body. He was on the verge of slicing through the space in this area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que looked at Liu Shaoqiu with surprise. This attack lived up to the reputation of the Sword Sect’s Thirteen Swords, and if this person had completely comprehended this attack, then Ling Que might not have been able to defeat the Sword Sect genius and their battle might have ended in a draw.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong also stared on in astonishment. The inheritor of the Thirteen Swords was indeed not someone simple.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless people watched the confrontation between the two with great expectations, wondering whether or not Liu Shaoqiu’s sword would be able to defeat Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu’s eyes suddenly snapped wide open as he unsheathed the tip of his sword. With Liu Shaoqiu himself as the center, the sharp aura radiated out in a circle. The circle quickly expanded from a hundred, then a thousand, and then ten thousand meters away from Liu Shaoqiu. Everyone was enveloped within this sharp aura, and it caused their scalps to turn numb. This was a strength that could determine their life and death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong raised his hand and saw that a very miniscule wound had appeared upon his palm. It wasn’t just him; everyone who was within the Fifth Sword’s domain range had received various injuries to some extent. This caused the cultivators to become even more terrified, and they all hurriedly retreated again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin raised his hand and flicked out. The void twinkled and formed a white shockwave that shot towards the ground. The Fifth Sword had not been completely unleashed yet, but it had already tried to harm Lu Yin, which was normally impossible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin suddenly shook his head when he made contact with the Fifth Sword. “This sword is still beyond you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd had not thought that Lu Yin would suddenly say such a thing, and many went into a daze while only a select few looked towards Liu Shaoqiu with a bit of sympathy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span> sighed from the heavens. “The Fifth Sword, where human, sword, and domain merge as one. He has merged human and domain, and human and sword. However, he has yet to merge sword and domain. His strength was not properly contained, and that caused it to fail at the last minute. This sword is not something that he can use yet.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind Elder <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span>, Liu Sanjian looked at the screen with pity. “If he could use the Fifth Sword, then Shaoqiu would definitely be the strongest down there.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span> replied faintly. “Not necessarily. No, that’s actually wrong; even if he could use the Fifth Sword, he still would not be the strongest.” Elder <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span> stared at Lu Yin. “I saw this person battle against Mu Rong, and this kid has a strength that has also reached the pinnacle. He is not someone who can be withstood by those in the same realm, unless they have similarly reached a pinnacle in some aspect.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Sanjian was lost. “The pinnacle?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span> nodded and explained, “Yes, the pinnacle, like the Ten Arbiters.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Sanjian was shocked. “That kid can rival the Ten Arbiters?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span> did not reply, but he did not deny the possibility either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of the Ten Arbiters was from the Sword Sect, so they clearly understood the strength of the Ten Arbiters. These monsters’ reputation was not something that had been fabricated; it was genuine. Even to a powerhouse like Liu Sanjian, who neared the strength of an Enlighter, the strength of the Ten Arbiters when they had been Limiteers was something that was unimaginable to him, as it went against his understanding of the universe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely because the Sword Sect understood the strength of the Ten Arbiters when they had been Limiteers that they had not cared much for Lu Yin and the rest when they were proclaimed as Ten Arbiters candidates, because the gap was just too vast. They were simply not on the same level. The so-called “Ten Arbiters candidate” title was just given as encouragement. But on this day, a person who could truly rival the Ten Arbiters had appeared. Liu Sanjian understood quite well how scary it was for someone to rival the Ten Arbiters strength in the Limiteer realm and how inconceivable such a thing was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To all the Limiteers present, such a person was nothing but a freak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was no wonder why, after Lu Yin acted, Elder <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span> had ordered everyone to retreat. This was someone who was literally unstoppable by those present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On Planet Pyrolyte, just like what Lu Yin had said, Liu Shaoqiu was not able to completely execute the Fifth Sword. His forcefield had collapsed, or it was also possible that it had collapsed on its own since he had not managed to merge the sword into his domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu spat out a mouthful of blood, and he suddenly looked miserable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked at him calmly. “Although this sword is still a bit beyond you, you’re not far from being able to unleash it. I’ll wait for your challenge since I probably won’t become an Explorer before you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu couldn’t accept such words. “Are you pitying me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin shook his head. “It doesn’t matter if you believe me or not, but it will be more difficult for me to become an Explorer than you. However, even before breaking through, I’ll still be able to challenge the Top 100 Rankings. So the agreement can be nullified today, as you are currently unable to challenge the Top 100 along with me.”&nbsp;</span></p>

However, he did not regret his actions one bit. If he did not even have the courage to engage in a battle, then how could he even consider trying to surpass his ancestors?&nbsp;</span></p>

Lu Yin casually struck out with a Spacerender Palm, unleashing a shockwave that swept out and sent them all flying away. “You guys can’t take him away.”&nbsp;</span></p>

Her injuries were severe, as Lu Yin remembered how she had used Zhuo Daynight as a shield. He had not shown much mercy in his previous attack, and it was mostly thanks to her Nightking’s Body and her battle force that she had managed to survive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing was being supported by other Daynight members, and she sent a death glare at Lu Yin, as if she wanted to devour him.&nbsp;</span></p>

If you dare take it, Elder Yuanjing will not protect you or your Great Yu Empire!” Nightqueen Yanqing threatened.&nbsp;</span></p>

If possible, none of them wanted to retreat, but it looked like the Daynight clan wanted to violate the agreement at this time.</span></p>

However, right now, they were all against Lu Yin, and he did not have much of a background. At best, he could be considered to hold the status of the Sea King’s future son-in-law, but he was just the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">future</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;son-in-law.

Aside from the people from the Northline Flowzone, there was only this kid on top of the mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi did not back away. Instead, she stepped forward, towering high in the sky as she prepared to speak. However, she could not think of a good opening line, so she simply rolled her eyes. “Dregs, I’m your Miss Qi.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mountain range fell silent, and everyone stared blankly at Hai Qiqi. Even Mu Rong was included in the speechless crowd. Dregs? Was she referring to them?</span></p>

This opening line was too awesome!&nbsp;</span></p>

Such a serious occasion had been completely destroyed by her. However, this also caused his resentment towards her to diminish greatly. The one who had plotted against him was the Sea King, not Hai Qiqi.&nbsp;</span></p>

Although he had also participated in the competition to become the Sea King’s son-in-law, he had never actually met the Sea King's daughter. This was her? He suddenly felt incredibly lucky that he had not pulled out the Sea King's Trident.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que stared at the scene blankly while feeling that something was off. The Sea King’s daughter’s first words had been a bit too unrestrained.</span></p>

This was Lu Yin’s fiancée? The two made quite a match.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing’s pupils shrank. The Sea King's daughter! It was no wonder why she had humiliated Nightqueen Yanqing in such a manner. Yanqing suddenly felt as if she would never be able to do anything to this stupid brat for her entire life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yōu Ye'er was also surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She’s the Sea King's daughter?</span></p>

This was the effect and the kind of entrance that she had always wanted. As a girl, she desired the spotlight even more than a man, but she had always been overshadowed in the Starfall Sea. She had let the selection for her future husband be held just so that she could have someone accompany her when she left the Starfall Sea to go out and play. Her lifelong dream had finally been achieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that the Sea King's daughter had appeared, Nightqueen Yanqing could no longer find a single word. The Sea King’s attitude could be seen by the fact that he had allowed his own daughter to accompany Lu Yin out in the universe, and the Daynight clan’s threats to him were now completely meaningless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rest sighed. Sure enough, Lu Yin really did have something to rely on before taking action.</span></p>

Everyone felt an immense pressure descend on the planet as they all looked up. A face appeared from outer space; it was the Second Grade Hall’s Enlighter, <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Karthika</span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

He continued to stare at Lu Yin. “Kid, did you hear me? Hai Dashao’s personal promise isn’t enough to represent the Sea King’s Dome, which means that they won’t intervene in a conflict in the Outerverse. They will not protect your empire!”&nbsp;</span></p>
