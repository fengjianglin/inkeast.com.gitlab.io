 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

The battle caused half of the city to be destroyed, and even changed Zenyu Star’s weather, to the point where one of its three rings were slightly fractured. In the end, Undying Yushan was heavily wounded while Huo Qingshan and some of the other Thirteen Imperial Squadrons’ captains were slightly injured as well. Fortunately, there were no fatalities from this battle.</span></p>

Yu, you cannot escape.”</span></p>

But compared to the Astral River, the Cosmic Sea was way larger, and many people believed that the Astral River actually originated from the Cosmic Sea.</span></p>

Roars rang out from within the inundating sea from time to time, and shadows of huge beings frequently swam past the ship.</span></p>

The person who attacked him hasn’t been identified yet,” You Ling muttered in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do we actually have to investigate this? It must have been someone from the Neohuman Alliance—only they would keep investigating the Court of the Seven Names,” an icy voice responded from the cabin. It was the high pitched voice of a woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Could it be the Daynight clan?” You Ling asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s impossible. Little Yin’s actions aren’t enough to cause the Daynight clan to send out a Hunter realm powerhouse. Moreover, they are focused on their expansion into the Outerverse, so they won’t initiate any battles without a serious reason. The Ross Empire’s attack on the Great Yu Empire shouldn’t have been the Daynight clan’s influence either, since they wouldn’t be so nearsighted. Oh right, where is Little Yin?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He went to the Shenwu Continent,” You Ling replied.</span></p>

We cannot give up on the Great Yu Empire. If he really is one of the Seven, then this is a huge matter. Once we discover the truth behind that issue, we’ll be able to return home.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You Ling’s eyes gleamed. “Understood, captain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Shenwu Continent, crowds of people bustled about in the broad streets. Five planets covered the sky above the passersby’s heads while a huge sun radiated warmth, bringing life and energy to the continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monotone chirping of cicadas was enough to cause drowsiness within anyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was lying under a tree and helplessly looking at his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Shenwu Continent had its own ecosystem, which would cause one’s star energy to gradually weaken and their combat ability to slowly decrease. Martial power completely suppressed star energy here, and Lu Yin had been able to feel that from his previous fight with the Explorer. The effect of the star energy suppression was actually quite significant here. If it weren’t for his five-lined battle force, then he would have suffered the same fate as Arikar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He definitely needed to get some martial crystals as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wondered how Arikar was faring. Information about Lu Yin would definitely be leaked now that Arikar had been captured by the natives. Lu Yin had immediately used star energy to change his appearance and also decided to assume a false identity. From now on, his name here would be Lu Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack crack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, a convoy was slowly rolling through the streets. There were quite a few people following it, and apart from some laborers, the rest were mostly soldiers responsible for protecting the convoy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The animal dragging the carts resembled cows, but they were much larger than any cow Lu Yin had ever seen. They had a gentle look to them, but they were probably quite strong since each of them was dragging a cart covered with white cloth towards the west.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes gleamed as he hid his aura and tailed the convoy from within the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Half a day later, the convoy stopped when the sun set. “We will reach Taicang City in Qiong Zhou in half a day’s time, so let’s take a ten minute break for now. We’ll continue on after that,” someone from within the convoy ordered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group paused to take a break.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The soldiers automatically spread out and kept watch on their surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin slipped into a cart while the guards weren’t paying attention. Since each cart was completely covered by a piece of white cloth, no one besides the animal pulling the cart would be able to notice him under the cloth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few tired laborers were eating their rations near Lu Yin’s hiding spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This work is inhumane. It’s unpaid, and we even have to bring our own food! I hope that that damn city lord dies soon,” a laborer ranted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone next to him sighed and replied, “We don’t have a choice. It’s just our rotten luck to have a city lord like this. Sometimes, I wish that these tributes would be stolen and cause some trouble for the city lord.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“His Majesty’s birthday is almost here, and these are tributes for His Majesty. Who would dare to steal these things? Besides, we’re almost at Qiong Zhou and will reach Ming Zhou soon. That’s the empire’s capital, and it’s filled with powerhouses. No one’ll dare to touch this stuff.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“By the way, I heard that the people from Ming Constables were sent out again. It seems like there are more aliens running around nowadays. The world is too chaotic now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I just want to get home quickly after we’re done with transporting this stuff.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin leaned against a crate while his eyes lit up. This convoy was carrying tributes! He was quite lucky with his find this time. There were probably some martial crystals in this convoy, and even if there weren’t, there would still be some precious items that he could trade for martial crystals. This wasn’t a bad haul at all; he hadn’t stolen anything for quite some time either, so it was a good opportunity to refresh his skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, let’s head out and try to reach Taicang City before curfew,” the leader shouted as the laborers all stood up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, Lu Yin suddenly attacked, slamming his palm into the back of the leader’s neck. Although the leader was a Limiteer, he could not even begin to compare to Lu Yin. He fell unconscious from just one attack, causing everyone around him to be shocked before they all started attacking Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked around him with disdain. He knocked all the guards into a daze within ten seconds, causing all the laborers to run away in fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin walked to the first cart and pulled the white cloth away. He then opened the crates to reveal many gleaming metal items, which looked similar to the jewellery back on Earth. All of these items were useless to him. The second crate was filled with antiques, but the third crate was filled with martial crystals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was overjoyed at the sight of the martial crystals; this was exactly what he had been hoping to find. There were more than ten carts, and the other carts were all filled with martial crystals. After all, it was the perfect item to offer up as tribute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the more than ten crates of martial crystals only amounted to the equivalent of two star crystals, leaving Lu Yin sorely disappointed. Although it seemed like a huge amount, it was actually very little and it wasn’t even enough to reach the Sentinel realm. However, Lu Yin assuaged himself and decided to take it slow; this was just the tribute from one city. Furthermore, martial crystals were quite rare in the Shenwu Continent and were restricted items. It was already quite lucky that he had found this much already.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stored around two hundred martial crystals into his cosmic ring and ignored the rest of the items. He didn’t have time to trade all of them away, and it would probably be faster for him to just go and rob more people. However, Lu Yin still had his principles, and he would only rob those who had a bad reputation, such as the lord who owned this current convoy. He wouldn’t touch anything from people who carried a good reputation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could only start absorbing the martial power after he had around ten thousand martial crystals, as that would ensure that he could battle for a solid period of time. Otherwise, he would be forced to absorb stray martial power from the environment, which would just be too slow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">News of the robbery quickly spread, and troops from Qiong Zhou immediately blockaded the roads and started questioning the soldiers who had been robbed in hopes of finding some leads. However, Lu Yin was too quick, and between his speed and the dim light of dusk, no one had seen him clearly. Thus, the authorities could only blindly search for the criminal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin didn’t dare to enter a city, as he had learned some information about the heavenly globes from Wu Xia’s memories. Each city had its own heavenly globes that could sense star energy. Because of their existence, Lu Yin would definitely be detected as soon as he entered a city. He didn’t want to be chased around by the people of Ming Constables, as there were Martial Emperor powerhouses in that organization, which were equivalent to Explorers. It would be very troublesome for him if his identity as an alien was revealed, as those people from Ming Constables were very familiar with the greater universe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was completely dark when Arikar was led to the prince’s study within the Reverent King’s estate. His face was pale, and his abdomen had been bandaged, covering his heavy injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Reverent King, Ming Zhaoshu, looked at him coldly. “Name, identity, and purpose.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Arikar panted heavily and honestly revealed everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Zhaoshu was surprised. “So you’re from the Blaze Realm. It’s been a long time. The last time the Blaze Realm sent anyone here was a hundred years ago.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Arikar wasn’t surprised by this reaction. After all, he had been informed about this before arriving. The Blaze Realm had sent someone into the Shenwu Continent a hundred years ago and never heard from that person again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who was the other person?” Ming Zhaoshu asked with a stern gaze. This was what he was the most concerned about, since there weren’t many people below the Martial Emperor realm who could withstand his attacks. That person had clearly been in the Martial King realm, and yet, he had been able to escape unscathed, which was proof that he was very powerful. Besides, that person had even done something unforgivable; he had seen the Reverent King’s daughter bathing and even emerged from her tub. If this incident ever spread, then the entire the Reverent King’s household would be humiliated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Arikar betrayed Lu Yin without any hesitation and told Ming Zhaoshu everything he knew about Lu Yin. He was very detailed and even told him about Lu Yin’s battle style that had been shown during the Astral Combat Tournament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Zhaoshu was shocked. “He comprehended five-lined battle force while still in the Martial King realm? It’s no wonder he was able to stand my attack. What is his personality like?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Arikar effortlessly slandered Lu Yin. “He’s despicable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Zhaoshu’s gaze turned cold and a huge pressure suddenly descended upon the room, shattering the tables and chairs around them. Arikar was crushed to the ground as blood dribbled out of his mouth. He looked up at Ming Zhaoshu in fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t like it when people lie to me. Tell me the truth,” Ming Zhaoshu coldly demanded.</span></p>
