 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man nodded with difficulty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How do the planets on the mainland survive?” Lu Yin was puzzled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The mainland is vast, and it isn’t entirely physical. Many places are linked by soil while others might float in a vacuum like the outside universe. They can drift along as well.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How do spacecraft travel about? According to you, the Sixth Mainland is mostly connected through soil.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There aren’t any spacecraft, and the Sixth Mainland hasn’t developed any technology either. In the past, your Fifth Mainland was defeated because it had countless sects, families, and powers, not to mention that they never properly developed a unified cultivation system. Our Sixth Mainland only has one sect, which is the Daosource Sect. All cultivation begins with the Daosource Sect, and it also ends with the Daosource Sect.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is an imprint?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha! Sure enough, your Fifth Mainland lost imprints as a method of cultivation long ago! If the war truly does break out again, your Fifth Mainland is finished!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin lashed out with a kick without holding anything back. The man spat out a mouthful of blood, and barely managed to explain, weakly saying, “The so-called imprint is an ability to borrow a super powerhouse’s projected strength. Every super powerhouse can install a sculpture of themselves in a certain realm, and those statues allow cultivators to emulate the powerhouse. Explorers and above can use an imprint to boost their strength.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do the terms ‘Progenitor of Bloodlines Territory’ and Progenitor of Combat Territory’ mean?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah, those terms are literally what they sound like. They are the realms of the Progenitor of Bloodlines and Progenitor of Combat, respectively.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes went wide. “Progenitor of Bloodlines? Progenitor of Combat?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haven’t you guessed the truth already? Why are you asking so much? They are naturally Progenitor level powerhouses. Your Fifth Mainland has cast aside a portion of its cultivation system, but do you really not even know about the Progenitor realm?” the man mocked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes narrowed, and the Ghost Monkey’s voice reverberated through his head. “It’s really referring to a Progenitor! The Sixth Mainland and Fifth Mainland… This monkey has occasionally seen these terms referenced in the past. Seventh Bro, if what this person says is true, then the Sixth Mainland is not just a bit stronger than the universe. Every Progenitor has the power to change the sky!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin remembered what he had experienced on the island at the end of the Astral Combat Academy’s Dao of Heaven’s Ocean of Death. Fifth and sixth: could those words have been referring to the Fifth Mainland and Sixth Mainland?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Also, Mister Mu had said that he belonged to neither the fifth nor the sixth. Could these numbers have also been referring to the Fifth and Sixth Mainlands? If so, then that meant that the top-notch powerhouses in the known universe already knew about these circumstances, but this knowledge had been concealed from the bottom-rung cultivators like Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, ask him what he meant by ‘the war breaks out again.’” The monkey was anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stared at the man. “Did you just say that the war will break out again?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man spat out a mouthful of blood. “That’s right. One year ago, the Daosource Sect sounded the war alarm and invaded the Fifth Mainland with the intention of completely vanquishing the Fifth Mainland’s evil survivors.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One year ago, the universe had gone through its great changes, and it was also when the Outerverse had been cut off from the Innerverse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A switch seemed to flip in Lu Yin’s brain.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could the separation of the Innerverse and Outerverse and the changing of the sky be related to the Sixth Mainland’s invasion? Hold on, the Human Domain, Astral Beast Domain, and the Technocracy all belong to the same area of the universe, which means that they all fall within the label of the Fifth Mainland.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He finally understood now. When the Astral Beast Domain had suddenly withdrawn their forces from Ironblood Weave, the reason had been because they had supposedly been invaded. It now looked like that was the Sixth Mainland. They had not invaded nor just the Human Domain, but also the Astral Beast Domain since they both belonged to the Fifth Mainland.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He suddenly understood why Elder Lohar had revealed such an expression when the astral beasts retreated back then. His expression had not been that of relief, but rather that of even more intense worry. It must have been because the invasion of the Sixth Mainland had begun.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin seemed to understand many things all at once. During his time in the Daosource Sect, the fatty and the others had mentioned something about some&nbsp;Hunt as well as some war. They must have been referring to this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If this was the truth, then the Innerverse was probably also fighting against the invasion of the Sixth Mainland right now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elegant-looking man glanced at Lu Yin, who seemed to be lost in his shock. His eyes flashed as he deftly pulled out a steel needle that had been hidden in his clothes and flicked a finger at Lu Yin. This needle was a power vessel that he had purchased; it was able to ignore a person’s star energy defenses and was even able to penetrate a Hunter’s body. Within three seconds, it would absorb all the blood from the person that had stabbed, giving them a miserable death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The steel needle shot through Lu Yin’s star energy, and glimmered with a cold radiance as it neared his body. The man on the ground was ecstatic, as no matter how fast his attacker might be, there was no way for him to dodge this needle, and any defenses were useless. He was doomed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s finger twitched as he activated the Yu Secret Art. The steel needle vanished only to reappear in a nearby pit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man’s mouth fell open as he stared in shock. “Tha- that’s a secret technique!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin casually waved a hand, striking the man with a vicious blow that shattered his rib cage and sent him flying across the ground. “Still haven’t given up, huh?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man looked up with great difficulty. “Why? Your Fifth Mainland constantly produces monstrous geniuses. I’m unlucky that I met one.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes flashed. “There are others from the Fifth Mainland here?”&nbsp;</span></p>

Cultivation systems are all broken, but they can still stand up to us. There are obviously no Progenitors guiding them along, but they are still able to kill the Realmlings!

It looked like he had just figured something out.</span></p>

He had obtained too much information just now, and it was rather overwhelming. This information was not something that a cultivator at his level should have access to.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, this was the best time to find out. If the Innerverse really was facing off against the Sixth Mainland’s invasion, then the people in the Innerverse would have also learned about these events in the past.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Lu Yin now had to worry about whether or not the Innerverse and Neoverse would both be destroyed. When the Fifth Mainland’s Daosource Sect was still around, his universe should have also had some Progenitors, but they were defeated. Now, there should not be any Progenitors left in his universe, and they still needed to fight off the Sixth Mainland, which was practically invincible in comparison.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Progenitors could change the skies, so could a Progenitor have taken action more than half a year ago to change the sky?&nbsp;</span></p>

He was also worried about the friends that he had made, and he hoped that they were all alright.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, this information is disastrous! If everything that he said is true, then we’re guaranteed to lose this war! A single Progenitor that they send out will be enough to wipe us all out,” the monkey spoke forebodingly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Doesn’t the Astral Beast Domain have any Progenitors?”</span></p>

Of course not. Progenitor Wushang was the last Progenitor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, what are you thinking about?” the monkey asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked up. “Who do you think those people from the Fifth Mainland visiting the Daosource Sect are?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The futons can only bring over people whose skeletal ages are under forty, which means that they have to be a part of the younger generation. Who are you thinking of?” the monkey asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Ten Arbiters,” Lu Yin said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I agree.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the Ten Arbiters had really been visiting the Fifth Mainland’s Daosource Sect all this time, then everything could be explained, including what the Ten Arbiters had relied on to become so powerful. This place was the Daosource Sect, which was the starting point of all cultivation. The Ten Arbiters had relied on this Daosource Sect to forcefully grasp authority in their younger hands, as this place was the starting point of all cultivation. The Daosource Sect could be considered as the sky, and they were some of the rare few who were able to enter the Daosource Sect, so the entire universe was forced to support them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To verify this theory, Lu Yin just had to corroborate his theory with this Xing Kai person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin suddenly remembered something that Elder Lohar had mentioned to him, which was that it was a pity. The old man had said that if the Outerverse had not been cut off from the Innerverse, then he could have given Lu Yin a position. The elder had also mentioned the requirement of a skeletal age below forty. Could that comment have been related to this place? There were people among the Ten Arbiters who were about to leave the younger generation, which meant that they would no longer qualify to enter the Daosource Sect and that there would be vacancies for others to compete for.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Strength was one form of authority, but what truly allowed the Ten Arbiters Council to enjoy nearly limitless authority was the right to enter the Daosource Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoever could enter this place would obtain the entire universe’s protection. If Lu Yin’s guess was right, then the fact that he was able to enter this place meant that he had become a foreign member of the Ten Arbiters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He felt grieved as he thought about this. So many youths from the Sixth Mainland could enter this place, but only a few from his own universe were able to do so. Since this was the case, then the Fifth Mainland must have suffered a crushing defeat during the ancient war.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long after, the scene before Lu Yin’s eyes changed, indicating that he was about to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could not understand how a small futon was able to shuttle him through the void, but this was a power that he could not comprehend.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he looked around at his surroundings, Lu Yin was once again in King Zishan's palace. The futon beneath him had indeed dimmed in radiance, and he would not be able to return to the Daosource Sect for some time. He fell in deep thought before stepping out of the room. He had been in the Daosource Sect for twenty days, which meant that as far as anyone else was concerned, he had remained in seclusion for twenty days.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he walked out of the palace, he bumped into Kayze.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Highness, you’ve returned.” Kayze immediately advanced and greeted him respectfully. “Lady En Ya has been waiting for you for several days.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded. “Send her in.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before long, En Ya entered the sitting room where Lu Yin was waiting for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Majesty, this is the first draft of the alliance contract. Please check through it,” En Ya respectfully said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin took the contract and looked through it. “Alright, let’s go with this.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This so-called alliance contract was nothing more than an excuse. Lu Yin’s main goal in establishing the Great Eastern Alliance was to integrate the resources of multiple weaves. He didn’t want to just unite their material resources, but all their powerhouses as well. He was going to build a sturdy wall to protect the eastern weaves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had originally only wanted to just unite the eastern weaves, but after his trip to the Daosource Sect, his mindset had changed. Uniting just the eastern weaves would be pointless. Once the invasion force of the Sixth Mainland arrived, such an alliance would be as frail as paper. If he could completely integrate the entire Outerverse and then use the Outerverse’s strength to withstand the Sixth Mainland’s attack, then that might be a bit more useful. The main point was for him to use the Outerverse’s resources to upgrade the strength of his external aids.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the short term, it was not feasible for him to cultivate his own abilities to the level where he could cause the Sixth Mainland to be apprehensive of him. Thus, he could only rely on external aids.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his die’s Enhance, he had endless possibilities. Of course, the premise was that he could first gather all of the resources from the various weaves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Highness, the Vastdearth Sect, Six-Fingered Tribe, Tri-Banner Federation, and other powers have already started to ally with us,” En Ya said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin grunted. “Because of those whose secrets we hold?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.”</span></p>
