Even Monster Loach had been unaware of its presence, and naturally, since Tian Hou had not known, Lu Yin had been ignorant as well.&nbsp;</span></p>

Its mission was to protect the hole in the energy stream. It didn’t care even if all of the astral beasts in the Primal Zone perished; it was following direct orders from Skymender.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In another place, Wen Qichen and <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> were surrounded by three Enlighter astral beasts while another Enlighter beast flew out with the intention of killing Lu Yin. However, it was strangely attracted by the piece of Progenitor Wushang's hide that was draped over the head of the desiccated corpse, almost as if something was beckoning it over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The beast changed targets to the corpse, as it wanted the piece of Progenitor Wushang's hide.&nbsp;</span></p>

It reached out with a withered arm and clashed against the giant claw. Its hand pierced through the claw and almost instantly tore through the beast while <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> watched on in fear. The enormous beast had just been shredded apart like a piece of paper by the dried out corpse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the other three Enlighter astral beasts, Wen Qichen, and <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> were all shocked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corpse had no blatant power, but the strength that it had just displayed was simply awe-inducing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of the Enlighter beasts bellowed and charged towards the corpse. The void was sliced apart in layers, and a terrifying strength completely enveloped the corpse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corpse’s eyes were like blackholes. It turned its head and allowed a frightful attack to streak through its body. The thing then shot back with the attack and through the attacker. Yet another Enlighter beast had fallen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> felt frightened, as this corpse was definitely a freak with a power level of over 300,000, and he wanted to get as far away from it as possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qichen looked into the distance.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why hasn’t <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span> ignited the pyrolyte yet?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On a dark planet, Lu Yin’s physical body endured an intense pain even as various scenes appeared in his mind. His body started to undergo changes. He was breaking through.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A brilliant light flowed out from his physical body and illuminated the planet before penetrating the atmosphere and entering the void. The image of a phenomenon vaguely appeared, but it was very fuzzy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Phenomena were things that only existed in legends. It was rumored that geniuses with powerful innate gifts were able to produce phenomena when they broke through to the Explorer realm. These people were the favored children of the universe, and they were smiled upon by the heavens themselves. They were people with the potential to gaze right into the very essence of the universe. Since recorded history, there were extremely few individuals in the universe who had produced such phenomena during their breakthroughs, and it was possible that not even all of the Human Domain’s Ten Arbiters had produced phenomena when they broke through in the past.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A phenomenon was a symbol, one that signified that a cultivator was entering another level altogether.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A title would be specially bestowed by the Hall of Honor to the powerhouses who produced phenomena. The White Knight of the Ten Arbiters, Ling Gong, had produced a phenomenon. Thus, the name “White Knight” had been given to them by the Hall of Honor, and it had thus become&nbsp;the Arbiter’s title.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And now, in the Primal Zone, Lu Yin’s breakthrough to the Explorer realm had shaken the universe and birthed another phenomenon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, there was no one around to appreciate it, and even Lu Yin himself did not notice the phenomenon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the planet, the phenomenon cleared up bit by bit, and the void rippled like water as a small sapling appeared above Lu Yin’s head. It grew slowly at first, but then it quickly flourished until it covered the entire planet. After that, it continued to grow outwards, and it gradually pervaded the entire local region of space.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The phenomenon was a tree, but its drooping branches distorted the void and emitted a gas. It seemed as if living things were being created beneath the bows of the tree. Under one branch, a ball was forming, and under another branch, a sword was being created. Under yet another branch, a square object was coming into being, and under still another branch…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many objects grew out from the tree, but the tree itself was born from Lu Yin. It gradually covered the vastness of space.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The phenomenon became more and more clear with each passing moment, and as the scope of the phenomenon grew larger, it eventually caught the attention of countless astral beasts from the Primal Zone.

As it moved along, it swept Wen Qichen and two more Enlighter beasts aside, reducing all of them to mere pools of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> was stunned. In the blink of an eye, three Enlighters had been wiped out. The corpse had displayed a strength that was incomprehensible to the human Enlighter, and past the corpse, he could see a phantom image that caused him to shudder.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had been fortunate that he had not been in the direction that the corpse was charging in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Off in the distance, the pyrolyte still had not exploded, and <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> knew that something had gone wrong. It was possible that something had happened to Elder <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span>.</span></p>

Wen Qichen was dead, and Lu Yin’s status was unrelated to <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span>. In truth, he hoped that the kid would die. <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span> was likely gone as well, and the mission was now a complete failure. The only good news was that the kid Lu Yin had lied, as Monster Loach had not shown up. Since that was the case, then <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> merely needed to return to the fortress alive, since what was possible to do had already been done.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he glanced at the phenomenon, <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> was able to deduce some basic facts, but after he saw the corpse dash towards the phenomenon, he knew that Lu Yin was about to face a disaster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The phenomenon was still expanding, and the corpse charged towards the phenomenon of the giant, growing tree and appeared on the planet. It looked at Lu Yin and then raised its leg, aiming at him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, in the middle of his smooth breakthrough, complex runes appeared on Lu Yin’s back that soon formed the shape of a lock that had pierced into his body. The runes began suppressing the breakthrough process. This was the seal that had appeared in the past during Lu Yin’s breakthrough into the Melder realm, but at that time, the crazy headmaster of Astral 10 had appeared and shattered one layer of the seal. However, there were more layers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The changes occurring to his physical body, and even the phenomenon, stopped progressing at this moment. In fact, the phenomenon of the giant tree even started gradually vanishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the phenomenon completely vanished, it would mean that Lu Yin had failed to break through, and at that moment, his formcast model would shatter. The next opportunity for him to break through would be after an unknown amount of time passed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corpse appeared and moved behind Lu Yin. It swatted down at Lu Yin with one hand without revealing the slightest trace of sentience. “Ancient bloodline detected. Target acquired: kill.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the Enlighter realm astral beasts, Liu Qiuyu, and the other powerhouses had been easily killed by a casual attack from the corpse, and since Lu Yin was currently experiencing a breakthrough, he did not have his universal armor on. It was essentially guaranteed that he would be smashed to pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But as luck would have it, the withered hand landed directly on the seal. Although the seal formed from the complex runes was preventing Lu Yin from breaking through, it was also protecting him from another perspective. This was just like the time when he had been struck by the light beam from the battleship. Back then, this seal had also protected his physical body from being vaporized.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corpse’s attack was fruitless, so it swatted at Lu Yin once again. There was another thump, and the ground split open, but the seal on Lu Yin’s back shone brightly and resisted the attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

It seemed to have been agitated by the phenomenon produced by Lu Yin’s breakthrough, and it had no thoughts of giving up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the seal was continuously attacked by the corpse, it caused the suppression of Lu Yin’s breakthrough to become unstable. Every time the seal was about to completely suppress and stop his breakthrough, its resistance would be shattered by a slap from the corpse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The impressive tree that was formed from the phenomenon was sometimes massive and sometimes small, and its changes created a strange cycle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During this cycle, Lu Yin was plunged into a state of unconsciousness and stuck in a strange state where he was not breaking through, but where his breakthrough had not failed either. In this state, he was staring at that jade finger, and he kept staring…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monkey regained consciousness, and he saw the corpse’s slap the moment he opened his eyes, which instantly beat him into unconsciousness once again. This beast was the most miserable one of them all at the moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the border of the Primal Zone, <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> charged out while panting heavily. He did not dare to pause for even a moment as he continued flying straight back to Seasons Fort.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This damned place</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">, he thought to himself, as he wanted to never return to the stronghold.&nbsp;</span></p>

This was completely different from its assault on Wang Wen, as its drive to kill Lu Yin greatly surpassed its previous desire to kill Wang Wen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Day one, two, three… even on the tenth day, the corpse still had not given up, continuing to strike at the seal without rest.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even if he had exchanged his points away, it was impossible for him to not have a single point. She also guessed that he had died, and a complex expression appeared on her face, just like Charon’s.</span></p>

However, not a single one of the creatures dared to act. Monster Loach and the Enlighter realm Amethyst Beast had also appeared, but not even they dared to intervene. The corpse did not seem to be more powerful than them, but it gave them an indescribably puzzled feeling, which caused them to be apprehensive.&nbsp;</span></p>
