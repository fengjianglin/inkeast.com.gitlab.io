 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-c655ce74-7fff-ee38-060c-143e16466562"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Five Hunters. That number even surpassed how many Hunters the Great Yu Empire had. This was a large scale assassination attempt.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The five powerhouses attacked the spacecraft simultaneously, and Lu Yin immediately donned his Enneadic Wings, dashed out of the vessel, and waved his hand. One of the attacks was diverted away while another was blocked by the Blind Monk who was protecting Lu Yin. The other three attacks struck the hull of the spacecraft and caused it to tremble.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Lu Yin appeared, the five people immediately dashed towards him. The Blind Monk pulled out a metal shovel and quickly moved in front of Lu Yin to defend the regent; one sweep of his shovel was enough to fling two of the attacking Hunters away. An attack landed on Lu Yin, but his Enneadic Wings emitted a radiant barrier that rendered the Hunter’s attack ineffective.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Enneadic Wings had been upgraded six times, and the speed that Lu Yin could reach with them was enough to rival an Enlighter’s, while its protective shields couldn’t be breached even by a Hunter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can deal with those two. Leave these three to me,” Lu Yin ordered coldly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blind Monk did not hesitate to raise his shovel and shoot forwards towards his opponents.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not one of the three Hunters spoke a single word, and they all attacked Lu Yin silently. Lu Yin’s seven lined battle force appeared at this moment, and with his Enneadic Wings. He repelled an attack before grabbing at one of the Hunters. This Hunter was not slow, and they managed to dodge aside by moving at an extreme speed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, with his Enneadic Wings, Lu Yin’s speed could rival an Enlighter’s, which made his attacks very difficult to evade. Lu Yin seemed to turn into a glint of light that flashed in outer space, and it rendered the three Hunters incapable of even finding the right direction to attack in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin grabbed one of the Hunters as he unsealed all three grains of Fatesand and released his full physical strength before landing a palm on the Hunter’s back. The Hunter spat out a mouthful of blood, and half of his body went numb.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even a peak Hunter like Kong Shi could not overcome Lu Yin with strength alone, let alone this person whose power level barely exceeded 100,000. A single palm from Lu Yin crippled half of this assassin’s fighting capabilities.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other two Hunters exchanged glances, and they unexpectedly stopped attacking Lu Yin. Instead, they charged towards the Blind Monk.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blind Monk was still able to hold his own while being besieged by two Hunters, but when those two were joined by another two, his situation turned critical in the blink of an eye. He was strong, and he could even be called an elite among Hunters as he could compare to the Innerverse’s Hunter elites. However, he could not face off against four opponents of the same realm by himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin grew furious, and he quickly retrieved the ancient pike from his cosmic ring and thrust it forward. His attack was not fast, but his intention was to force some Hunters to focus on him again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As one, the four Hunters abandoned the Blind Monk and changed targets to focus on Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the pike collided against the four Hunters, not even Lu Yin was able to easily tolerate the spiritual force attack that was unleashed. It enveloped the void and caused the local space to shudder. The four Hunters appeared to be overwhelmed; how could this pike unleash this level of strength?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This pike had killed a transformed Corpse King with an innate gift of metal that had been much stronger than these four Hunters. This time, the pike pierced through one of the Hunters’ necks without any resistance, leaving a dead corpse floating through outer space. The other three Hunters felt light-headed from the spiritual force attack, and blood dripped down from the corner of their mouths.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four Hunters had attacked as one. Even with Lu Yin’s protective measures, the force from the four powerhouses was still enough to forcefully shove him back ten kilometers. Fortunately, Lu Yin’s defenses were sturdy enough to keep him safe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the Blind Monk’s shovel landed firmly upon a Hunter’s head with a loud thump, knocking the man unconscious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although this attack had knocked one Hunter unconscious, it also awakened the remaining two. One of them held the Blind Monk back while the other grabbed the unconscious Hunter and fled. As for the one that Lu Yin had severely injured earlier, he had long since made his escape.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The area returned to a peaceful silence, only interrupted by some intermittent flickering sparks in the distance caused by the occasional explosion aboard the spacecraft. There, the people were all busy fighting fires and repairing the vessel.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blind Monk moved behind Lu Yin. “This subject’s protection was not perfect. Your Highness, please punish me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin waved a hand, though his expression appeared cold. They had sent five Hunters as a team to kill him, and if not for the support of his equipment, then he would not have survived the attack. Who in the Outerverse was able to send out five Hunters?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was definitely not some strong power, as they would not have sent just five ordinary Hunters. Instead, Lu Yin would have had to at least face peak Hunters like Kong Shi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These five Hunters were probably not from the same organization.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed like there were quite a few groups who held a grudge against Lu Yin in this part of the universe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He returned to the spacecraft and immediately contacted the Mafioso Planet’s bespectacled Mistchild. “I’ve just survived an assassination attempt.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was stunned. “What? Assassins were sent after Your Highness?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There were five Hunters. Check into it. I want to know who’s behind this assassination attempt,” Lu Yin said coldly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young Mistchild immediately acknowledged her new orders. “Rest assured, Your Highness. As long as one of those dark powers took action, I’ll definitely be able to find out who was behind this.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It may not have necessarily been one of the dark powers, and the attackers might not even have all come from the same organization. Still, hurry up with your investigation,” Lu Yin ordered. He then ended the call and turned around to stare outside the spacecraft with his hands clasped behind his back. As a person climbed higher and higher, the danger that they would face would also increase. This time, it had been five Hunters who had attacked him. The next time, it might be an Enlighter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did not believe that all of the Enlighters in the Outerverse’s eastern weaves were in Ironblood Weave. The Hall of Honor could not learn everything about the Outerverse’s going-ons, and there were many cultivators adept at concealing themselves. Those individuals were the ones who posed the greatest threat towards Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin considered the Six-Fingered Tribe. Could Luke Shamus have intentionally lured him out of the Great Yu Empire so that they could attempt to assassinate him? However, Lu Yin did not consider this option to be very likely as Luke Shamus could not have mobilized five Hunters so quickly, even if he wanted to. Moreover, that man could not have known what route Lu Yin would take.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right, my route.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Lu Yin turned back around and ordered, “I want a list of names of anyone who might know of our route to the Lars Weave for this trip.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, Your Highness,” the Blind Monk immediately assented.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spacecraft was fine and ready to continue traveling after one day of repairs. The following day, Lu Yin arrived at the Six-Fingered Tribe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had arrived in secrecy this time, in order to prevent the elders who were still resisting joining the alliance from taking any overt actions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Lu Yin arrived, his first order of business was to meet with Bach Shamus, who was the Six-Fingered Tribe’s leader.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bach Shamus had not expected for Lu Yin to arrive in person, and he was completely unaware of the conditions that Luke Shamus and Lu Yin had discussed. He believed that Lu Yin had made the trip because he valued the Six-Fingered Tribe, which made Bach Shamus feel proud, but also a little apprehensive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I never thought that Your Highness would personally make the trip to visit my Six-Fingered Tribe and be our guest. We didn’t make any advanced preparations, so we have neglected Your Highness,” Bach Shamus said courteously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, the two men sat down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin smiled. “We’re about to be allies, so there’s no need for Chief Bach to be too courteous. I heard that Chief Bach wished to speak with me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bach Shamus solemnly replied, “Your Highness is straightforward, so I’ll cut to the chase. I wish to know the true reason why Your Highness is establishing this alliance.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin tapped his fingers against the table as he calmly replied, “Just as the alliance contract stipulates, I wish for all of us to mutually help each other out and integrate our resources so that they can be enjoyed by all of us.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bach Shamus shook his head. “My Six-Fingered Tribe has fundamentally agreed to this alliance. However, why is Your Highness still unwilling to speak the truth despite such sincerity?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin seriously studied the man in front of him. “Did you experience any of the war in Ironblood Weave?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bach Shamus shook his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin reminisced about that time, saying, “That place was a blackhole of death, regardless of if one is an Explorer, Cruiser, Hunter, or even an Enlighter. There is less than a 50% chance of leaving that place alive after arriving, and it’s considered as one of humanity’s battlefields. Now that the Innerverse and Outerverse have been separated, the Outerverse can no longer obtain any support from the Innerverse, which means that the Outerverse’s current predicament is much more dangerous compared to before due to the unknown civilizations hiding in the Astral Wilderness, the Astral Beast Domain’s attacks, the possibility of the Technocracy invading us, and more. All of these concerns might become matters of life and death for the entire Outerverse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If we don’t join forces, how can we resist such issues? With our resources scattered all over, how can we improve our power? This is not a matter that I suggested by myself, but rather with the support of the Hall of Honor.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bach Shamus pondered his response. The Outerverse’s strength was indeed too scattered, and each weave’s individual strength was too frail, which the chief knew all too well. Joining forces indeed had various benefits, but he was not thinking about those at this time. “Your Highness, an alliance is possible, but who will lead it, and who will be next in the hierarchy?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin appeared amused at the question. “What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bach Shamus’s gaze flickered, but he did not quite dare to meet Lu Yin’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stood up. “Alright, I’ve said what I needed to say. Chief Bach, take your time to consider things. However, an alliance is imperative.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin then left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bach Shamus stared at Lu Yin’s retreating figure. This was the first time that he had interacted with this Great Yu Empire’s Royal Regent. Just as others had mentioned before, this person was rather tyrannical.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Leader, shall we…?” The Hunter protecting Bach Shamus made a gesture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bach Shamus glared at the man. “Are you mad? Since he came to Lars Weave, it means that he’s not afraid of any danger that we could stir up. As soon as our attempt fails, we’d be doomed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">News of the assassination attempt had not spread, so Bach Shamus and the others had not heard anything about it. If they had known that Lu Yin was fine even after five Hunters had attempted to kill him, none of them would dare to harbor any such thoughts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, Lu Yin wanted Bach Shamus to act against him. Then, he could easily install another leader in the Six-Fingered Tribe who would be more malleable to his demands. That was one of the reasons why he had met with Bach Shamus in private, not even bringing the Blind Monk along with him. Unfortunately, this leader was too timid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The focus of Lu Yin's present trip was not actually Bach Shamus, but rather Luke Shamus, as he was the person who was actually in control of the Six-Fingered Tribe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two met in one of the Six-Fingered Tribe’s sacrificial grounds, as this sort of place held a rather prestigious place for the tribe. Luke Shamus had chosen to meet Lu Yin in such a location to demonstrate his true allegiance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your subject, Luke Shamus, pays his respects to Your Highness, the Royal Regent.” The moment he saw Lu Yin, Luke Shamus immediately bowed and demonstrated the etiquette of the Great Yu Empire’s etiquette.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin smiled and propped the man up with a single hand. “Elder Luke, there’s no need for such courtesies.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luke Shamus looked at Lu Yin and responded respectfully, “I should. As your subject, that is how I should act.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin smiled and looked around. He saw many guards in the area, though they all seemed to be Luke Shamus’s trusted aides.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You invited me here for a transaction, so speak. How shall we handle this deal?” Lu Yin asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luke Shamus hurriedly replied, “This is not a transaction, but an offering. Your subject is willing to offer the Six-Fingered Tribe’s greatest secret to Your Highness. Of course, if Your Highness thinks that it is useful for the empire, please entrust this subject to share the empire’s burden.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What secret?” Lu Yin did not want this man to continue spouting nonsense, so he directly went to the crux of the issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Highness, please follow me,” Luke Shamus spoke respectfully. He then opened the underground entrance that led down into the tribe’s sacrificial area.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin brought the Blind Monk along with him as he followed Luke Shamus. He did not need to worry, as he had checked this place before coming, and there were very few rune lines here, which meant that there was nothing that could threaten him in this place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They traveled far underground, where the atmosphere became very gloomy. There was not so much as a single flame to light their way, but that didn’t matter to them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After walking for a certain distance, Lu Yin noticed strange diagrams engraved on the walls, which should represent the history of the Six-Fingered Tribe. As they walked along, Lu Yin casually observed them and saw that some depicted very small populations, which should be the timed extermination of the tribe’s population that occurred every 10,000 years.</span></p>
