 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had also been in an unconscious state for fifteen days, and during this entire time, he had been staring at that jade finger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, on the sixteenth day, he seemed to have comprehended something, and he raised his right hand and subconsciously tapped out with a finger. It looked like a very ordinary and common movement, but his finger transcended the void and crushed space. Lu Yin was actually able to fracture space with his strength that had not yet reached the Explorer realm, and his finger moved towards the corpse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Coincidentally, the corpse had just unleashed a strike and was in the middle of preparing another when the finger landed on its forehead.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The void warped, and the distortion spread out until it caused the entire planet to tremble. Lu Yin’s subconscious finger tap forced the corpse to take a step back, and with this retreat, the seal on his back lit up with a brilliant radiance and completely suppressed his breakthrough to the Explorer realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Lu Yin’s finger tap seemed to have granted the corpse some enlightenment of its own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ancient bloodline detected. Kill.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A phantom image appeared behind the corpse with two hands raised up high, and these hands then firmly swung down to land directly on the seal behind Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The seal broke apart, and in just an instant, the phenomenon of Lu Yin’s breakthrough burst forth once again, the giant tree enveloping the entire planet just like it had at the beginning of Lu Yin’s breakthrough. The tree then continued to spread away from the planet and into space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The numerous astral beasts in the region blankly stared at the scene, at a complete loss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The seal had been shattered by the corpse, but there was more than just one layer to the seal on Lu Yin’s back. In the past, not even Astral 10’s crazy headmaster had been able to determine how many layers there were to the seal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corpse had shattered one layer, but another layer quickly appeared and revealed a seal that bored through Lu Yin’s shoulders. The appearance of this seal released a frightening aura that spread throughout the entire region and crushed all of the nearby astral beasts. The dried up corpse was blasted underground by the overpowering force. Once again, Progenitor Wushang’s hide shifted slightly on the corpse’s head, and its eyes were again covered up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like before, the corpse was only able to stare eternally at Progenitor Wushang's hide, lost in its state of awe until someone disturbed it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The seal that had prevented Lu Yin from breaking through to the Explorer realm had shattered, and the seal on his back that had been suppressing the corpse similarly vanished just like what had happened back when he had broken through to the Melder realm. At this moment, his breakthrough arrived in full, and his physical body was transformed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scope of the phenomenon continued to expand as Lu Yin sat on the planet’s surface. His heart rumbled time and time again while he simultaneously absorbed the star energy around him at a frantic rate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the ambient star energy of the universe was not enough to satisfy him. Fortunately, he had regained consciousness the moment the seal had broken, so he quickly retrieved some star essence from his cosmic ring and placed it beside himself to form a small hill. He frantically absorbed that energy, using the ninefold rate of his Cosmic Art to create a scene that was reminiscent of a whirlpool.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pain in his physical body gradually faded, and the phenomenon also slowly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The star essence beside Lu Yin were also depleted at a rapid rate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin opened his eyes again and let out a long hiss that caused the nearby space to shudder. The sound waves created ripples that expanded out and caused the planet’s surface to split asunder.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Quite a few beasts moved towards the planet again, but they became frightened when they saw the countless corpses floating about space.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin released a long breath and completely awakened at this moment. He stretched his shoulders and neck, causing cracking sounds to ring out. He then looked down and clenched his fists. “So this is the strength of an Explorer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, he was able to see the changes in the universe. Things were no longer incomprehensible, and he felt an indescribable intimate connection with the universe. He could feel that he was now able to roam the void with just his physical body, as his body had been completely transformed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Similarly, he could sense a strange state affecting his body, and it seemed to be quickly draining his energy away. It was immediately apparent that only by replenishing his reserves with star energy would he be able to slow this depletion. This must be the period of exhaustion. If he allowed this state to persist, then he would probably enter the period of exhaustion that he had heard about and then die.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the image of the corpse flashed into Lu Yin’s mind. He peered down into the ground and looked at the monster. The corpse was indeed still there, but it had been forced all the way down into the planet’s core by some force. The core was clearly a great distance from the surface of the planet, so how was he able to still see it?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin closed his eyes and released his domain, which quickly expanded to what had been its limits in the past. He found that he was able to easily continue expanding his domain, all the way until it reached the planet’s core. His domain had just extended to more than ten times its previous distance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin felt strange, as he had not heard that breaking through to the Explorer realm could cause one’s domain to expand to such a degree. What was going on?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Above the planet, many beasts paced back and forth as they stared vigilantly at Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had no time to review all of the various changes he had just gone through. He knew that his breakthrough to the Explorer realm had brought about a massive transformation within him, but he needed time to thoroughly check things over. However, the most important thing at the moment was to leave the Primal Zone and return to Seasons Fort.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blackhole-grade Aurora from before had fallen to an unknown place, but fortunately, his cosmic ring still held a collapsible spacecraft that Wang Wen had given to him before he had left for the mission. Lu Yin’s domain expanded away from the planet, and his eyes filled with star energy. He relaxed after discovering that none of the nearby beasts were too powerful for him to face. There actually wasn’t even a single Hunter around, though he was able to see many corpses floating around.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn't hesitate any further and retrieved his collapsible spacecraft. He immediately boarded the vessel and took off from the planet, charging towards the boundary of the Primal Zone at the speed of a radiant-grade Aurora.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From start to finish, none of the beasts in the area had any intentions of blocking his path as they were all too frightened. There had been a few Hunters monitoring Lu Yin, but they had all been instantly eliminated. Although these astral beasts did not fear death, such an inexplicable method that was able to kill in an instant had caused the survivors to feel timid.</span></p>

When Lu Yin appeared at Seasons Fort, he arrived precisely when Liu Qiuyu hollered loudly and dragged an Enlighter beast down with himself. At this moment, Seasons Fort finally fell.&nbsp;</span></p>

In the corner of the beast’s mouth, there was a half-mangled human body. The creature glared down at Wang Wen and then bit down at him.&nbsp;</span></p>

At this point, the sky was littered with astral beasts, and more importantly, there were boundless rune lines in every direction that showed the presence of many Enlighter realm beasts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The beasts would not allow a single human to escape.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Wen frowned. “What do you mean? At a time like this, are there still secrets that you want to keep? Are you a girl?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you want to live?

Since we’re just waiting for death, I’ll let you keep your secrets. Don’t end up like that wretched black fog who couldn’t help fend them off at the crucial moment.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin watched as Wang Wen turned around. Then, he stepped into the ruins and raised a hand. His die appeared before he tapped on it. Every time he faced a crisis, this die was his first choice, and there was no exception at this moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It slowly spun before stopping on... one pip. There was a thump as a yellow prayer mat fell out. When Lu Yin saw it, he seemed to hear the sound of chanting, and his entire body was drawn to the mat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was certain that the prayer mat was not as simple as it seemed, but now was not the time to study it, so he continued to roll the die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As it slowly stopped spinning for the second time, it landed on four pips.</span></p>

The scenery around him changed, and he next appeared in the Time Stop Space.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, there was only one Enlighter still defending Seasons Fort, which was <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span>. On the other hand, there were five Enlighter beasts. If they wanted to break through the invading forces, then their only option was to kill off all of the Enlighter beasts. <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> could not do such a thing, but Lu Yin could. He had his gun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But just relying on his gun would not be enough to kill the Enlighter beasts since they could simply dodge the attacks. The only way he could guarantee his shots landing was the Yu Secret Art. Wendy Yushan was not with him, so he could only use it himself. One had to at least be an Explorer to cultivate this secret technique, and fortunately, Lu Yin had just become one.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was not afraid of not having enough time, as he could endlessly extend his stay in the Time Stop Space so long as he had enough resources.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he had broken through to the Explorer realm, he had absorbed 20,000 star essence, which was a hundred times the amount that he had used when breaking through to the Limiteer realm. He did not know how much star energy others had needed when they broke through to the Explorer realm, but it was definitely much less than him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But fortunately, he had 48,000 star essence to begin with, so with 28,000 left, it should be more than enough for what he needed to do.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He increased the duration of Time Stop to four months, which cost him about 700,000 star crystals, which was only seven star essence. During these four months, he was hoping to fully comprehend the Yu Secret Art.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan had not spent that long a time to comprehend the Yu Secret Art, and Lu Yin’s aptitude was not too bad. Thus, it shouldn’t take him too long to succeed.</span></p>
