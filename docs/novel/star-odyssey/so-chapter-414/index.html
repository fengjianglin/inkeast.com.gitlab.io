He had underestimated the Cruiser’s recovery speed. Despite periodically injuring his captive, the man had still managed to recover enough energy to the point where he could break free of Lu Yin’s star energy restraints. The Cruiser had only been enduring his captivity from the beginning, and he had escaped as soon as he was confident. By now, it was only a short distance to the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin helplessly watched on as the man slipped away like a fish and sighed.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Forget it, I just lost some fish bait.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;He then raised his head and looked up at the mountain, the place where he intended to go next.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The path of cultivation was fraught with dangers, but that danger was unavoidable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin glanced at his right arm. Actually, he still had another piece of bait.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, I suddenly noticed that you are very handsome.” The monkey suddenly flattered Lu Yin, who grinned. This damned monkey was too shrewd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin could not head back at this point and started moving towards the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Cruiser male hid within the ocean off in the distance, watching as Lu Yin headed towards the mountain. Only then did he finally relax. His gamble had paid off, and this person wouldn’t pursue him in this vast ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was possible that the only exit from this space was atop that mountain, so the Cruiser needed to follow Lu Yin. The situation had reversed, and it was now Lu Yin’s turn to act as bait.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he approached the mountain, Lu Yin was able to more acutely sense the gathering aura. Lu Yin did not know how exactly to describe the sensation. Tyrannical, sharp, unparalleled; he could think of many adjectives that were close to fitting, all of which involuntarily popped into his mind since he had never come in contact with such an aura before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mountain was cylindrical, and it almost looked like it had been directly tossed into the seabed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Lu Yin reached the side and looked up, he could not see the peak. He then raised his hand, struck the mountain wall, and found that it was very sturdy. He used a bit more force but was still unable to damage the wall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The durability of the mountain could be easily imagined if he could not affect the wall even with his current strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Endless rune lines had converged upon a mountain, so what exactly was this thing? Lu Yin’s eyes grew heated, and he started manually climbing up since he could not fly in this space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, do you think that this mountain is safe?” the monkey asked nervously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin shook his head. “I don’t know, but it doesn't matter if it’s safe or not. We have to climb it since this is the only path.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Lu Yin started climbing, the Cruiser on the seafloor started gradually coming up, all the while maintaining what he felt was a safe distance from Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, that bastard’s coming over to the mountain.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin grunted. “When he starts climbing, go ahead and make a move. You can capture him, and we’ll use him as fish bait again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright!” The monkey was excited but also a little afraid since he had nearly been used as fish bait himself. This Cruiser bastard had to be caught, as that person was the only one who deserved to be bait.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man’s eyes trembled as he watched Lu Yin climb higher and higher up the mountain. He soon grabbed a hold of the wall with both hands and started to climb himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the man’s pupils shrank, and an intense fear filled his eyes. His entire body started vanishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Se- Se- Seventh Bro, look down!” the monkey shouted anxiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin lowered his head and his expression changed. “What’s going on? What did he do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nothing! He only touched the mountain!” the monkey shouted, completely terrified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s scalp grew numb as he stared at the disappearing man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the bottom-most part of the mountain, the Cruiser completely vanished from sight, bit by bit, until it was as if he had never existed. It was an extremely horrifying scene, as anyone would despair if they had to watch themselves vanish from existence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Cruiser never could have even dreamed that he would die in such a manner. Even though it was a painless ordeal, the desperation and terror that he felt in his final moments surpassed everything else.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t just the Cruiser who was terrified, but also Lu Yin. When his hand made contact with the mountain wall, he had felt like he was in front of the underworld. He realized that the Cruiser’s existence in this space had been thoroughly rejected. This was what happened when someone fought against the cultivation path of the Runemasters; their very existence was directly erased from the universe in an act of complete destruction.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a rather strange and terrifying battle style.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A healthy, living person, and a Cruiser at that, had soundlessly vanished in an instant. He had only touched the wall, just the side of a mountain! No one could have expected that a mountain would possess such an attack. It was so odd that it toppled everyone’s common sense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, I feel like we should go now.” The monkey was starting to panic; he had almost used his innate gift of shadows to touch the wall. He was now terrified since he felt like he had nearly doomed himself to oblivion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded, as the cold cliff now felt like a freezing slab of ice, and he could not wait to stop touching it. It felt like he was holding a grenade that could go off at any moment, or that he was walking along the edge of a precarious cliff. He was certain that he would never forget this feeling for the rest of his life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin released his grip on the mountain with both hands and was just about to jump into the ocean, but at that same instance, his face went deathly pale. His clothes started disappearing.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was also at a loss. “I can’t let go! If I do, I might vanish!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That can’t be—it’s the reverse?! That bastard vanished when he touched the wall, but you can’t let go of it. What kind of trick is this? Try again! We can’t die here!” the monkey shrieked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin frowned and released one hand from the mountain wall. He was fine. But when he slowly pulled his other hand away from the mountain, his clothes immediately began to disappear. He hurriedly grasped the wall with both hands again and grimaced. “I can’t remove both hands at once. Monkey, it looks like our only choice is to climb up if we don’t want to die.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monkey fell into despair. “During the many years I’ve roamed the Astral Beast Domain, I’ve gone to many strange places and read many famous journals. I once even visited an Envoy’s grave, and I managed to live through all that. I’ve never heard of a mountain that can cause people to vanish, and I never dreamed that I would appear in such a place. My dear Feng Jiu, my Celestial Ice Phoenix harem! Seventh Bro, this is all your fault!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, enough with the melodrama. Why don’t you come up with a way to help me climb up? The exit might actually be at the top.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s hope so. Seventh Bro, our destiny will determine whether or not we survive.” The monkey was extremely depressed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin took a deep breath, and his expression firmed. Since he had to climb, he would go all-out. He refused to believe that he would actually die here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin didn’t know exactly how tall the mountain was; he only knew that he could not see the peak and that he had no other fate besides climbing up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eventually, he even lost sight of the ocean’s surface. He could only make himself look upwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One hour, two hours… One day, two days…&nbsp;</span></p>

The scenery along the way remained completely monotonous. The higher he climbed, the further he could see. He could see the forest, the white beach, and once in a while, he could even see a black dot that represented either a person or a war spirit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people in the forest definitely could not see Lu Yin, and none of them would have ever thought that there was someone climbing up the sheer face of that tall mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Lu Yin continued to climb the mountain, the Great Yu Empire’s war to recapture Frostwave Weave was coming to a conclusion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The captains of the Great Yu Empire’s Thirteen Imperial Squadrons were all at least at the Cruiser realm, and there were few in the entire Frostwave Weave who could rival them. When Undying Yushan had been in power, he had worked hard to formulate a strategy to unite the entire Frostwave Weave under the Great Yu Empire’s rule. Just as when the empire eliminated Firesmelt Planet, everything had already been planned out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As long as no other powers entered the fray, it would be nearly effortless for the Great Yu Empire to unite Frostwave Weave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unification relied on military force while governance relied on stability and economy. The Great Yu Empire was experiencing an economic depression, and even though it received the financial support from Innerverse powers like the Watermoon Mountain, its military power was too great, causing the surrounding weaves to coordinate and embargo its economy. This led to Frostwave Weave’s economy remaining handicapped, to the point where even if they managed to unite the entire weave, the empire would still crumble and decline because of the failing economy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Qingshan and the others had tried to contact Lu Yin for several days to ask Lu Yin to make an executive decision, but they were unable to reach him. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

Deep Crimson Hall was one of the powers living in the Chaos Flowzone, but it only governed one territory. It was nothing compared to Chaosgod Mountain, and it could be destroyed at any time. But even still, it had its own methods of survival.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within a giant city on Deep Crimson Planet, there was an unending flow of flying machinery. The traffic was especially intense at night when the routes around the city were sealed in order to be used as race tracks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone knew that this city’s owner, Wu Pa, enjoyed exciting aircraft competitions and raced every night. The races featured modified aircraft, and this night was no different than any other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dozens of vehicles shuttled back and forth, causing the air to distort before vanishing further down on the race track.&nbsp;</span></p>

He laughed maniacally, as none of the other machines gave way to each other, but no one would compete with Wu Pa.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Pa’s flying style was extremely brutal; he had a penchant for crashing into others, which caused the other racers to take extra care not to fly too close to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gradually, Wu Pa took the lead.</span></p>

His position in Deep Crimson Hall was not low, and he governed an entire city. On top of that, he was an Explorer whose power level was almost at 50,000. Thus, he was only a single step away from breaking through to become a Cruiser. He was among the top ten combatants even within the entire Deep Crimson Hall, and no one had ever dared to ram into him during one of these racing competitions. Despite that, something new had just happened.&nbsp;</span></p>

His demeanor was completely different from back at the academy, and it seemed as if he had changed. He raised a hand, and star energy surged as he shouted, “Firesoul Gun!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Pao shot out a star energy bullet that was boosted by two-lined battle force, and it squarely struck Wu Pa.</span></p>

The bullet easily pierced through Wu Pa’s palm and continued traveling through his arm. It tore through the void and split the mountain route behind him in two.&nbsp;</span></p>
