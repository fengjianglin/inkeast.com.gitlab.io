 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hui Daynight was taken aback. He had not spoken much from the beginning and had instead been maintaining a low profile. He didn’t expect that Lu Yin would suddenly call him out here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others also looked at Hui Daynight, understanding Lu Yin’s intentions. The characteristics of the Daynight clan were too obvious, and it was universally known that it was not a good idea to provoke them. Thus, not many people dared to offend them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hui Daynight didn’t have a choice, so he walked over to the screen and talked with the powers who had sealed the space in front of them. Without much delay, their spacecraft soon sped off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Daynight Flowzone bordered Chaos Flowzone, so it was normal for Daynight members to appear here. The average person would not dare to provoke any clan member, and no one would dare to impersonate them. This was because everyone who had made such attempts in the past had been exterminated without exception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Daynight clan abhorred impersonators, and they showed no mercy to such people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hui Daynight, you can just sit in front of the screen since there’ll definitely be more blockades up ahead,” Lu Yin called out from behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hui Daynight felt helpless. He was practically being treated as a travel visa, but he did not complain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, I think that we should change routes,” Xia Luo suddenly spoke up as he shivered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone looked over at him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve received news that the Bo Duo have contacted a Hunter of the Relentless Slayers to track us down. Hui Daynight can intimidate these small powers into letting us pass, but that definitely won’t work on the Relentless Slayers,” Xia Luo continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group trembled, as this meant that there was another Hunter chasing after them. In the end, it would not be easy for them to escape after all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They all opened a star chart and studied it while trying to map out various other routes. Xia Luo commented, “We can only flee in this direction, or else we’ll either run into the blockades of other various powers or the expert from the Relentless Slayers. There are tracking devices in Seniors’ bodies, so we can’t escape. This direction is the safest.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone looked at the place that Xia Luo had pointed at, only to see that the only words there were “Starfall Sea.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a mysterious place in the Innerverse called the Starfall Sea. Legend had it that it was an enormous body of water, but it wasn’t related to the Astral River or the Cosmic Sea at all. This place was a true ocean formed from multiple streams, and it had flooded a certain area of space. There, both planets and mainlands were submerged within the sea, and spacecraft could only travel over the water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to the legends, there was a stream inside the Starfall Sea that would cleanse the space at regular intervals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The legends also said that, in the Starfall Sea, weapons would frequently appear that did not belong to this universe. Supposedly, there were even battle techniques that came from ancient times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Legends had it that, in the Starfall Sea, there were super powerhouses whose power levels surpassed 500,000.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Legends…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In brief, there were too many legends and stories about the Starfall Sea. It was so overwhelming that no one knew which ones were true and which ones were false. Countless people in the universe wanted to explore the Starfall Sea, and it was seen as a paradise for powerhouses, because many cultivators had actually achieved amazing results after returning from the Starfall Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s deepest impression of the Starfall Sea was the Undying Manual. Years ago, together with Undying Zishan, Undying Yushan had roamed the Starfall Sea, and the two of them had even changed their names later on, becoming the Undying Duo. Undying Yushan had even charged into the top thirty of the Top Hundred Rankings, shocking the heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Undying Yushan had been severely injured by others precisely because of the Undying Manual, but by a fluke, he had managed to return to the Great Yu Empire. Many powers from the Innerverse longed to obtain that manual, and they had even impeded his plans to unify Frostwave Weave for it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It could even be said that, if not for the Undying Manual, the Great Yu Empire would have long since unified Frostwave Weave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had a rather deep impression of the Starfall Sea, but he had never visited it himself. He had not realized that he had gotten so close to it; just to the west of Chaos Flowzone lay the Starfall Sea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With our strength, it’s still a bit too dangerous for us to roam the Starfall Sea,” Zhao Yilong commented in a low tone. He was from Myriad Swords Peak, which was located in Spirit Seal Flowzone. They weren’t that far from the Starfall Sea, so he had some understanding of it. He continued on, saying, “Those who qualify to explore the Starfall Sea are generally all space-exploring powerhouses, because there’s a stream that washes everyone out of the sea at regular intervals. It’s something that spacecraft can’t withstand. It’s not that easy to reach the planets either, since even space-exploring powerhouses can barely defend themselves.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve heard that we can get a coating for the spacecraft at the entrance of the Starfall Sea and that the film can withstand the power of that stream,” Zora said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Yilong shook his head. “That’s too expensive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked up and locked his eyes firmly onto Lulu. The others did the same, everyone turning to look at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her brows lifted, and she sneered proudly. “Zhao Yilong, what did you just say? Too expensive?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corners of Zhao Yilong’s eyes twitched. “Just pretend that I didn’t say anything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Luo clapped. “Ladies and gentlemen, we don’t have any other choice. No matter what, there’s only one direction forward, which is towards the Starfall Sea. Otherwise, we’ll be caught by the Relentless Slayers’ expert. We might be alright, but our two seniors will definitely die without a doubt.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Pao and Little Pao’s faces sank. “We’ll take our personal spacecraft and leave. Without us onboard, the Relentless Slayers and Deep Crimson Hall won’t make things difficult for the rest of you. It’ll take some time for us to remove the tracking devices planted inside of our bodies, so we definitely won’t escape this time.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Luo solemnly replied, “There’s no time. We’re definitely already being tracked. The Relentless Slayers is Chaos Flowzone’s most professional assassin organization, and they are hidden very deeply, so they’re not afraid of anyone. No matter if it’s the Astral Combat Academy, the Lockbreaker Society, Shamrock Enterprises, the Daynight clan, or even the Mavis family, they would still dare to attack people from those groups. The name ‘Chaos Flowzone’ is not an empty title, while powerful clans can deter smaller powers like Deep Crimson Hall, they won’t be able to intimidate groups like the Relentless Slayers.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chaos Flowzone itself is fraught with danger. It’s not like the Relentless Slayers haven’t assassinated Daynight members in the past; they have no hesitation about doing such things,” Michelle added on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Coco was shocked. “Sister Zora, they even dare to kill Daynight clan members? Aren’t they afraid of being annihilated by the Daynight clan?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zora forced a smile onto her face. “It’s not just once or twice that the Daynight clan has tried to ferret these people out. However, the Relentless Slayers have just hidden themselves too well. At most, the Daynight clan was able to destroy some of their more obvious businesses, but they’ve never been able to completely eradicate them. Moreover, external powers run into heavy resistance whenever they enter Chaos Flowzone, since Chaosgod Mountain won’t just watch from the sidelines. After all, Chaos Flowzone has no fixed laws, but it also has the greatest rules.” &nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one in the group opposed him since Lu Yin’s prestige was the highest out of all of them. If he had made a decision, then the others would not fight him over it. Moreover, this was truly the only path that they could take, as they would be caught by the Relentless Slayers’ experts if they headed in any other direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Pao and Little Pao expressed their thanks to the younger students once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hundreds of people could be housed in a small spacecraft, and there were more than ten rooms, so there was plenty of space to go around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin sat down in the study and watched outer space pass by. He touched his heart, his left arm, and his right leg; the grains of Fatesand had long since integrated into his body, which meant that he was no longer stuck in painful agony. However, he had no idea when they would actually awaken. Mister Mu’s description had been rather horrifying, as the man had said that some people never awakened their Fatesand, which left Lu Yin a bit confused.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His physical strength and star energy were being hindered by the three grains of Fatesand. This meant that his current power could not even compare to his strength back when he had fought against Tian Hou during the Tournament of the Strongest.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Yilong entered. His appearance caused Lu Yin to think of Wendy Yushan; she was a female disciple of Myriad Swords Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Lu, do you have some time to talk?” Zhao Yilong asked with a complex look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded and gestured for him to sit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Yilong did not sit. Instead, he walked over to the window and stared out at the stars. He seemed to be organizing his thoughts, though he still did not speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was amused by the situation. “Did you want to talk about Wendy Yushan?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Yilong turned around, and the expression that he showed Lu Yin was very serious. “What’s your relationship with Senior?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin considered the question. “Similar to familial affection.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Yilong was puzzled. “What does that mean?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Relatives, basically. Why? Are you and Wendy Yushan very close?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Yilong shook his head. “She’s my senior as well as the strongest heir of Myriad Swords Peak. We don’t qualify to even approach her. I’m here to tell you that it’s best not to try to woo her.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin frowned. “What’s the problem with hitting on her?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Yilong replied seriously, “As fellow students, I don’t want to watch you die.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin raised his brows. “What does that mean?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Yilong thought for a second before answering. “There’s a rumor in Myriad Swords Peak that Senior was only accepted into the sect thanks to someone else. Senior is from the Outerverse, so no matter how powerful her innate gift is, Myriad Swords Peak cannot possibly give her too many resources. However, her cultivation in the sect always progressed smoothly. Though no one knows what the underlying reason is, it’s rumored that she’s related to a certain person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who?” Lu Yin asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Yilong shook his head. “Nobody seems to know exactly who that person is, but the rumors say that it’s one of the Ten Arbiters.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes narrowed. “One of the Ten Arbiters? Which one?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don't know. Only Master or an esteemed elder of Myriad Swords Peak might know, No disciple would be privy to that sort of information. According to the rumors, Senior is unofficially betrothed to that Arbiter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s gaze shivered, and he grew unhappy. Although he had no plans of having a relationship with Wendy Yushan, he still did not feel comfortable watching her become someone else’s woman. It was a man’s natural possessiveness, and Lu Yin’s feelings had intensified after he had handed the Yu Secret Art over to Wendy Yushan. Her gaze when she had looked at him at that time had subtly changed. Just the thought of that expression made Lu Yin want to hold onto her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Does Wendy Yushan follow that particular Arbiter?” Lu Yin asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Yilong shook his head. “I don't know. After all, it’s just a rumor, and it’s hard to distinguish between what’s true and what’s false. If there really is an Arbiter who adores her, then she would not have been so severely injured when she went to the Ross Empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded, as that was indeed true. If it were him, he would not be able to watch on unconcerned while his beloved was severely injured. Wendy Yushan was someone from the Outerverse, but she had truly received great treatment from Myriad Swords Peak. Given the prejudice that people from the Innerverse held towards anyone from the Outerverse, it was actually impossible for her to not have a backer. Rather, it was just a matter of whether or not there was a so-called admirer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked at the gadget and suddenly considered contacting Wendy Yushan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Yilong left, as he had only told Lu Yin what he had out of a sense of camaraderie. It was none of his business whether or not Lu Yin actually listened to him. Although Lu Yin was very strong and had amazing talent, no one believed that he would be able to reach the level of the Ten Arbiters. Their existence was simply unsurpassed in the younger generation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked at his gadget and opened Wendy Yushan’s page. He thought about contacting her again, but he did not know what to say even if she picked up. Speaking of which, he actually did not seem to have any relationship with her, aside from their engagement which no one would recognize. However, Lu Yin simply had an uneasy feeling that he could not shake, especially when he recalled the look on Wendy Yushan’s face when she had looked at him in San Dios. He really wanted to ask if she had some supposed lover.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan was absolutely beautiful, so it was normal for her to have admirers. In fact, Puyu was one of them. However, the Ten Arbiters were on a different level, as the disparity between them and Puyu was too extreme. Lu Yin could ignore Puyu, but he definitely had to be careful whenever the Ten Arbiters were involved.</span></p>
