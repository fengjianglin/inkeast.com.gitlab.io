There was a stream running down the middle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He then tossed White Knight to the ground and sat down himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The trip to the Daosource Sect this time had been truly dangerous. Lu Yin had run into Shang Rong, Blood Looney, White Knight, and even Nightking Zhenwu. If he had been the tiniest bit less cautious, he would have lost his life, and his luck could be considered pretty good since he had survived thus far.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were still a few more days before his futon dimmed, and he would be able to return to the Fifth Mainland after quietly passing through these next few days. But what about when he next came to this place? He could not give up on that battle technique in the cauldron, as he clearly had a method that would help him comprehend it, though he had not yet succeeded. This feeling was torturous for Lu Yin, as he urgently needed more powerful battle techniques, but this place had long since become the most dangerous battlefield.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He glanced at White Knight, as even one of the Ten Arbiters had ended up in such a miserable state, let alone someone like Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wondered how Wendy Yushan was doing at this time, and he hoped that she was fine. At this moment, he somewhat regretted passing the second futon to Wendy Yushan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nobody would have thought that the Daosource Sect would become the cruelest battlefield for those of the younger generation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The current Lu Yin did not qualify to participate in this battlefield.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had not felt this helpless in a long time. Ever since he had upgraded his universal armor, he had been fearless even against Enlighters, and he felt rather nostalgic for such times.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked over at White Knight again.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This guy couldn’t have possibly died, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin walked over as he considered the possibility. He then reached over to remove White Knight’s helmet so that he could ascertain if the Arbiter was dead or alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the mask was peeled away, a delicate, unblemished, and pretty face was revealed. Lu Yin was stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thi- this, isn’t this a girl?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He dropped the helmet and blankly stared at White Knight. So the Ten Arbiters’ White Knight was actually a woman?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even when he had seen Nightking Zhenwu in this place, Lu Yin had not been overly surprised. However, he was truly shocked at this moment. Who would have thought the Arbiter known as White Knight was actually a woman! Even that would still be alright, but it turned out that she was actually an exquisitely cute and attractive woman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had seen many beauties, as he was surrounded by Wendy Yushan, Madam Nalan, Ming Yan, Bai Xue, and even the bespectacled Mistchild. Some of them were heroically beautiful while others were charming, pure, and some simply lovable. Their temperaments were usually very similar to the meaning of their names, but there was too great of a disparity between the one in front of him and her name.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The term “knight” gave people a sense of righteousness and reliability; it created a magnificent image in their minds. Nobody would associate someone so delicate and adorable with the image of a knight, and this contrast was too shocking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had heard that White Knight’s name was actually Ling Gong, which did not sound like a woman’s name either!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stared at White Knight’s face for quite a while, feeling that the whole situation was rather surreal. He could not help but raise a hand to touch her, and he even went on to touch her face and pinch her mouth. It was all real.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, White Knight’s eyes snapped open, and she stared coldly at Lu Yin, as his fingers were still pinching one of her fingers. He felt embarrassed at being caught.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If somebody had asked, out of Lu Yin’s entire life, what his most embarrassing moment was, he would have definitely answered that it was the moment White Knight Arbiter awakened while he was pinching her. In the entire universe, including both the Fifth and Sixth Mainlands, who would dare pinch an Arbiter’s face? He was the first, and he would probably also be the last.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He slowly retracted his hand and coughed. “If I said that I was trying to check on your injuries, would you believe me?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Knight silently coldly stared at him with frosty eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin coughed again. “That- I’m from the Fifth Mainland. You should know Wendy Yushan!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Knight’s cold gaze shot past Lu Yin, and she looked towards the sky. “Where is this place?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Daosource Sect,” Lu Yin blurted. When he saw that White Knight was still staring at him, he hurriedly continued, saying, “I don’t know the concrete details about this place, but we’re some distance from where you fought Shang Rong. It’s well hidden, and nobody should be able to find it.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Knight placed a single hand upon the ground and put her helmet back on. “I’m going to recuperate. Do not approach me, and do not touch me. Otherwise, I will let you know what an ugly death is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With some difficulty, she sat up, and then the fissure fell silent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stared at her and shook his hand about. He then shifted his gaze.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What recuperating? You’re probably just about to pass out again! With injuries like those, it would be weirder if you didn’t faint!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he had received a rather savage blow upon discovering that White Knight was a woman, not to mention that she was a girl with such a delicate, cute, and beautiful face. It could be considered rather cold, but for reasons unknown to himself, Lu Yin relaxed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Recuperate well. I hope you don’t die,” Lu Yin said quietly. He then looked off into the distance and began to recite the Stonewall Scriptures. He did not plan on venturing out at all over the next few days. Nightking Zhenwu and Shang Rong had both appeared nearby, and the region with the Nine Cauldrons was likely unsafe at this time. He would wait for the next time he could visit the Daosource Sect to search for the battle techniques within the cauldrons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">***</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the Daosource Sect’s Heaven's Pit, there were other people who had entered one after another after Lu Yin and the others had left, and there had also been more intense battles to seize control of the stone pillars. However, no expert like Shang Rong appeared this time, and not even someone like Butcher who could occupy a stone pillar by themselves had shown up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On one particular day, a girl stepped into the dusky space and slowly walked across the area. Each of her steps crossed the exact same distance, as if she had made prior measurements.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman’s black hair hung down to her waist, and she carried a white sword. Her features were exquisite, and she radiated a soldierly aura that was unlike other girls. She seemed even colder and more aloof than Wendy Yushan. The strangest thing about her were the large-framed glasses that she wore, as they had no lenses. Paired with her large eyes, it made her look rather endearingly foolish.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long after her arrival, the girl approached the area that was near the palm lines and looked down at Progenitor Chen’s palm print. There was a complex expression on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl’s demeanor and appearance attracted quite a bit of attention, as there were only a few girls who wore glasses and wielded swords. Her temperament seemed exceptional as well, and a few young men exchanged glances before slowly approaching her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good day, Miss. Can we become friends? I’m from the Grand Martial Realm-” But before the youth could even finish speaking, a trace of blood appeared around his neck. The man only felt his strength drain away as he slowly knelt on the ground. His entire body soon tipped over, and fresh blood stained the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other men were surprised. “Third Bro, what’s the matter?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A white light flashed, and then those men all crumpled to the ground in unison. Even the fresh blood that spilled out from their bodies pooled together and flowed towards the center of the palm print.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl’s expression remained calm. She then looked up and leaped into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few minutes later, the girl left the dusky space that contained Heaven's Pit and traveled through a light pillar to head towards other regions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long after, someone else entered the region with Heaven's Pit and soon arrived next to the palm print. They looked out and were greeted by a scene that seemed to come straight from the underworld.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cultivators who had originally been around Heaven's Pit, comprehending the palm imprint had all perished. There had been a total of twenty eight cultivators, but not a single one of them had survived, and the reeking metallic smell of blood drifted through the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the Ten Arbiters had arrived in the Daosource Sect, the Sixth Mainland’s cultivators had suffered more than a hundred casualties. These cultivators had been people who were able to obtain futons, and almost all of them came from powerful families. Their deaths would incite the wrath of many powers throughout the Sixth Mainland. Thus, the voices appealing for the Realmlings to enter the Daosource Sect and exterminate the Fifth Mainland’s evil members became ever louder.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the ruins of the Daosource Sect, the situation had already turned into a formal battlefield for the top-tier experts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if the number of casualties grew excessive, nobody would request for the Daosource Three Skies to enter the battlefield, almost as if the Daosource Three Skies no longer belonged to the younger generation. Countless people already classified the Daosource Three Skies as existences at a higher level, a level that stood far above those from the same generation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Knight remained unconscious for three days, and she only awakened on the fourth day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once she woke up, she noticed that Lu Yin was resting against a stone wall with his eyes closed. She did not think too much, and she picked up a stone before tossing it at him. It tore through the void and shot towards Lu Yin’s forehead. Just before it landed, his eyes snapped wide open, and the stone smashed into the mountain with a bang that caused a huge crack to appear on the mountain wall and many other rocks to fall down from above.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin got angry. “You’re crazy!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Knight coldly stared at him. “You should die for touching me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin opened his mouth to scold her, but then he thought of the embarrassing episode from three days ago, and he merely pursed his lips. “Touching you was my mistake. I apologize for that.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Knight’s eyes narrowed and grew icy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin warned, “You can’t seriously be considering hitting me.” He had not forgotten that the person in front of him was one of the Ten Arbiters, and her level of strength was entirely different from his own. Even with his secret technique that allowed him to divert attacks, he still had no confidence in being able to escape from the clutches of one of the Ten Arbiters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, White Knight did not attack him again, and instead, she glanced around and moved slightly. An intense pain shot down her back, causing her to groan in agony as her forehead beaded with sweat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin watched her, but he did not speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Knight tried to move once again, but each action she attempted to take caused a sweeping pain to wrack her body, most of which originated from her back. She turned to fiercely glare at Lu Yin. “Turn around! No peeking!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin grew suspicious. “What for?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I ordered you to turn around,” White Knight said in a strict voice. Star energy started to seep out from her body, looking as if it was about to go berserk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin promptly replied, “Alright, I’ll just leave. Anyway, you’re awake now, so anything that happens next is none of my business. You’re on your own.” And with that, he moved to leave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, you can’t leave,” White Knight suddenly commanded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was confused. “Why?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No ‘why.’ I said you can’t leave, which means that you can’t leave. This is an order,” White Knight growled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was amused. “An order? Who can you order about? Me? I’m not your subordinate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Knight looked at him coldly. “I can order around anyone who belongs to the Ten Arbiters Council, the Council of Astral Academy, or the Outerverse Youth Council. You are no exception, Lu Yin.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You recognized me?” Lu Yin was astonished as he had changed his physical appearance in order to hide from Nightking Zhenwu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Knight coldly continued on, saying, “Many people are able to recognize Wendy, but only a select few know about the relationship between Wendy and myself. Moreover, your appearance hasn’t changed that much, and since you were able to enter this place as well, it’s not that hard to guess who you are.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you recognized me, you should know about my relationship with Wendy. Saving you was a kindness for you taking Wendy to Myriad Swords Peak. Now, the two of us are settled, so I’m leaving.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve already said that you can’t go. That’s an order.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nobody can order me about.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Knight clenched her fists, and her gaze turned icy. “If you attempt to leave, I’ll kill you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin laughed. “Come on, lady, there’s a limit to being reasonable. I rescued you, and now you want to kill me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Knight grew furious. “You can’t talk to me like this!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin rolled his eyes. “Fine, I won’t talk to you anymore. I’m leaving, and you can’t stop me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the phantom image of the castle appeared all around the two of them, and the glorious sound of the clock rang out. Lu Yin’s expression changed drastically, and the domain that he had released was suddenly crushed. He felt an intense sense of crisis, and he turned back to look at White Knight. “What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve told you. You can’t leave,” White Knight said coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What exactly do you want?” Lu Yin frowned. This woman could not be reasoned with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Knight’s gaze flickered. “Turn away from me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?” Lu Yin was perplexed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m asking you to turn away from me. You are not able to refuse,” White Knight continued coldly.</span></p>
