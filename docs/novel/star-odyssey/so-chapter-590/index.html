Even if the humans won this battle, they would have to abandon Seasons Fort afterwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Giving up was one thing, but Lu Yin didn’t want to just run away with his tail between his legs; he was going to kill all these Enlighter beasts. Otherwise, even if he fled to the other forts, he would still be doomed.&nbsp;</span></p>

It had been reduced to nothing more than numerous fragments floating through space.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A hint of sorrow flashed through Lu Yin’s eyes. Within that fortress, not only had there been cultivators and soldiers, but their families had also lived there. So many planets and mainlands, carrying millions of people, had disappeared, just like that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After unleashing his domain, Lu Yin was able to hear numerous moans from all around him, and his face turned cold. The Astral Beast Domain. He was definitely going to get revenge on them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Watch out!” <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> suddenly shouted.&nbsp;</span></p>

Lu Yin waved a hand and activated the Yu Secret Art. In that instance, he saw the essence of the universe and managed to find another Enlighter Beast hiding in the void.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin then stopped using the Yu Secret Art and shot his gun.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span>, the void split open, and another Enlighter beast appeared. However, at the exact same moment that it appeared, a bullet went through its neck, releasing a whole massive spout of blood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had gone on the offensive and shot at the beast that was attacking <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

He’d been distracted by the beast directly ambushing Lu Yin and been completely unaware that there was another Enlighter Beast going after him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw that Lu Yin was about to be sent flying from an attack, <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> pressed a hand against the Enlighter Beast that had tried to attack him. A black fog shot into the beast’s injury, and soon, the creature started howling in misery.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The beast that had moved to attack Lu Yin was about to give chase, but after hearing the agony from behind it, it gave up on attacking Lu Yin and instead changed targets to <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span>. In its eyes, Lu Yin was already close to death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, the beast had no idea just how powerful the defense of Lu Yin’s universal armor was. Even if he went up against Monster Loach, Lu Yin was confident that he could survive, to say nothing of dealing with a mere Enlighter whose battle power was only at around 200,000 or so.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Lu Yin was still knocked dizzy from the blow as it had rattled his head. He flapped the Enneadic Wings and soared back into outer space to see <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> being surrounded by two Enlighter beasts. However, one of the beasts had already been shot by Lu Yin while the other had been gravely injured by <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span>. It was evident that they would soon leave the battlefield.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin raised his gun. When the bang was heard, he had already activated the Yu Secret Art.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> was startled. The sound of that gunshot was always terrifying to him; who knew where Lu Yin was aiming? <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> was always paranoid that someone was out to kill him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With this shot, Lu Yin managed to pierce through the injured Enlighter beast’s brain. Vast amounts of brain matter splattered onto the other Enlighter beast while also drenching <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second Enlighter beast looked at Lu Yin in disbelief. This human had managed to take one of its full power attacks and survive! This was impossible, especially considering how this person was merely an Explorer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span>’s black mist wound around the other Enlighter beast and ruthlessly flung it away from him and over towards Lu Yin. There was another bang from Lu Yin’s gun, which caused the second Enlighter beast to become absolutely furious. It barely managed to shrink itself in the nick of time and avoided having its brains blown out.&nbsp;</span></p>

The beast was incredibly frightened and did not even dare to look at Lu Yin again. It tore into the void and fled from the scene as quick as it could.&nbsp;</span></p>

The last two Enlighter realm beasts that had assaulted Seasons Fort also retreated.&nbsp;</span></p>

One of them had been dragged down by Liu Qiuyu, one had been killed by Lu Yin, another had been killed by Lu Yin and Topmist combined, and the last two had panicked after discovering what Lu Yin was capable of. They had both realized that they would not be able to block his attacks, and so, they had instead chosen to flee.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They could tell that Lu Yin had used a secret technique, and while Lu Yin was merely an Explorer, a secret technique was still enough to force them to take him seriously.&nbsp;</span></p>

Instead, they turned their gaze to the ruins of the fort and mourned in silence. As they looked at the bodies of their friends and families, they began grieving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked at his gun. There were still four shots left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After landing on a part of the shattered land, Wang Wen emerged from his coffin and began to size Lu Yin up and down once again. “I saw it. You killed two Enlighter beasts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin spoke in a quiet voice, “Let’s go. The fort is done for. Let’s head to one of the lower five forts.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Wen nodded. This wasn’t the time to discuss Lu Yin’s accomplishments. Wang Wen was most worried that Elder Lohar would not be able to stop Monster Loach and that the Enlighter Amethyst Beast would return. If that happened, then this region of Ironblood Weave would truly be cracked open. While Lu Yin had indeed been amazing, Wang Wen did not believe the newly promoted Explorer would be able to kill a freak whose power level was at 300,000.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin found Aden and Huo Qingshan. Thankfully, although both of them had been badly injured, they were still alive&nbsp;</span></p>

Just like he had said to Lu Yin, he hadn’t been able to survive. However, it hadn’t been just him. Many members of the Liu family had been stationed at the stronghold, and almost all of them had been killed in the last battle. Only a girl called Liu Shasha had survived. Even Liu Sanjian had died.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Less than ten thousand people had managed to survive, and Wang Wen gathered all of them up. Lu Yin was rather surprised to discover that Long Yun had survived, though he had been quite badly wounded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Charon also hadn’t died, and he looked at Lu Yin as though he was looking at a monster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seasons Fort is about to fall. We’ll head to one of the lower five forts, Brokenblade Fort…” Wang Wen succinctly explained the situation and made arrangements for everyone to withdraw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before leaving, Wang Wen went to Lu Yin. “With your achievements this time and your previous mission, you’ll be awarded 130,000 Ironblood points.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was surprised. “That’s a lot.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Wen shrugged. “This is something that we had agreed upon beforehand. If you went to the Primal Zone and acted as a guide, then you’d be given 50,000 Ironblood points. But because it was believed that you died, the commander and I decided to double it to 100,000. It’s a surprise that you didn’t die, but we can’t just revert the reward. Besides, this time, you killed two Enlighter beasts, one of which you killed on your own and the other through your and <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span>’s combined efforts. That’s why you only received 30,000 from this battle, and that works out to a total of 130,000.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin asked, “If I die, then my contribution doubles. If I had really died, then who would the reward have been given to?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Wen answered, “Your family.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was speechless. This guy definitely knew that Lu Yin didn’t have any family, which must have been why he’d been so generous in doubling Lu Yin’s points at the time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Would you like to exchange your points for items?” Wang Wen asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded. “I want star essence.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come with me.” Wang Wen led the way and brought Lu Yin to Seasons Fort’s resource warehouse and opened it up. Lu Yin was shocked to discover that he could see no less than 100,000 star essence piled up in small mountains.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“These are the resources that the Innerverse and Outerverse have supplied to Seasons Fort in exchange for achievement points in battle. You can take as much as you want,” Wang Wen said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was confused. “Why is there so much?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A lot of defenders die during wars, but just as many people gain achievement points that must be exchanged. This is the iron rule of the military, and honestly, what you see here isn’t actually a lot. Most of the resources were stationed at Ironblood Fort, but unfortunately, when it fell, all of those resources must have been lost and plundered by the Astral Beast Domain,” Wang Wen said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin glanced at Wang Wen. “So you’re telling me to exchange my points right now because I won’t be able to do so in the future, right?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Wen went silent, but then he nodded. “Yes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Give it all to me.” Lu Yin was very excited.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Wen thought it over. “If you store everything here in your cosmic ring, then you’ll be rewarded for your help. I’ll give you 10,000 points. However, you can only take 140,000 star essence, and you better make sure that everything else gets to Brokenblade Fort.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Leave it all to me. I promise that I can do even more in the future,” Lu Yin spoke with anticipation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Wen rolled his eyes. “There are rules to follow here, Pawn. There’s no such thing as giving you achievement points in advance. What would other people think? If it weren’t for the fact that you have a massive cosmic ring, I wouldn’t even want you to carry all this with you. It’s dangerous.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin found this to be quite a pity. It was evident that even though Wang Wen was afraid of dying, he was still a man of principle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aside from star essence, there were many other items inside the warehouse that could be purchased with Ironblood Points.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Seasons Fort had this many resources, then he couldn’t even imagine how much Ironblood Fort must have had. It was a pity that all of it had been taken.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Come to think of it—did astral beasts have cosmic rings? They must. He found it a pity that he hadn’t robbed them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Half an hour later, Lu Yin sat down at the uppermost level of a spacecraft that was floating in outer space. He gazed upon the broken structure that Seasons Fort had been reduced to and sighed. Would they be able to defend Ironblood Weave? He was very confused at this time. With the Void Thunderbeast protecting the gap in the energy stream, it was impossible to destroy that gap. Would he have to continue to rely on his luck with the die forever? That wasn’t realistic.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aden headed over and stood behind Lu Yin. “I ran into an ultra-powerful beast in the battle just now. It was only in the beginning stages of the Hunter realm, but it was incredibly powerful. I only managed to receive its attacks by using my nine lined battle force.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin commented, “That’s normal. There are no shortage of monstrous talents in the Astral Beast Domain.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“After being locked up by Undying Yushan for nearly a century, I’ve found that the universe really has changed. That beast is apparently on Skymender’s List and is called Cursewind. It’s supposed to be comparable to our Ten Arbiters. What are the Ten Arbiters?” he asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes lit up. “A beast on Skymender’s List?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aden nodded. “That’s what it said, and it even praised me for stopping it. Haha, I’m a person able to receive an Enlighter’s attacks, but I was praised by a beast in the beginning stages of the Hunter realm.” Aden frowned. “I have a feeling that it didn’t even go all out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes narrowed. “If it really was a creature on Skymender’s List, then your instincts should be right. The human’s Ten Arbiters are ten powerful humans while Skymender’s List is similarly made up of ten powerful beings from the Astral Beast Domain…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aden quietly listened as Lu Yin explained the two and became increasingly shocked. “The universe changed and gave birth to the Ten Arbiters and the Ten Arbiters Council. That’s unbelievable! I’m surprised that the powerful organizations agreed to allow such power pass on to the younger generation.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin didn’t know much about this matter either. The higher he climbed, the more confused he became. Although the Ten Arbiters were monsters, were they actually able to match up against Enlighters whose power levels had reached 250,000 or even 300,000? That was impossible, and the great organizations definitely had such powerhouses. Even tiny Northline Flowzone had Northgate Taisui, who was capable of destroying the Ten Arbiters by himself. In that case, why were the Ten Arbiters able to wield so much power?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, Lu Yin had assumed that all he needed was to gain support from the other organizations. However, ever since he had become the effective ruler of the Great Yu Empire, he had realized that that mindset might be wrong. As the master of an empire, he definitely would not calmly allow someone else to take his power. It made no sense. What right did the Ten Arbiters have to be given such a powerful status?</span></p>
