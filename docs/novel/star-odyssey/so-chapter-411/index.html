He looked up and sighed at the sky. “Could he really have been unlucky enough to run into it? Brother Lu, your luck is just too unfortunate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since ancient times, few people had ever managed to return alive after being swallowed by a storm of Tempest Flowzone. Of course, some survived, but everyone experienced different things. Some said that they fell into a bottomless abyss while others had ended up in a sealed space. Some had landed in a forest, and even more had dropped into a golden ocean. But when they were asked how they returned, everyone was the same: no one could answer, as if their memories had been erased.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, with the passage of time, people had come to discover one commonality shared by everyone who had survived falling into a storm; they were all good people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was not possible to definitively quantify what made a person “good,” but everyone who had survived and escaped from a storm had kind hearts, and almost none of them had ever killed before. Not all good people would come out alive, but all those who did were good people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin would not call himself a good person, so he had tried everything in his power to escape the storm. But in the end, he had still ended up being swallowed by the storm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he came to his senses, Lu Yin saw a forest all around him. The trees in this forest were not very tall, only about two meters in height. Lu Yin had never seen such a forest before, and he rubbed his temples. He had grown too careless after becoming famous throughout the universe, and he no longer had the prudence and caution that he once possessed. With his previous caution, he would have never used that route even if the chances of encountering a storm were one in a billion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Still, at least he was alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked around, noticing that it was completely silent. He then looked up to see a light shining in the distance. He did not know if he was looking at the sky or outer space, because the light was simply too bright, and it was even a golden color as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden radiance shining in the distance extended to cover the entire forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stood up and tried to talk to the monkey, but he received no response. The stupid monkey was silent once again; its defenses must have been too pathetic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin tried to fly into the sky, but he immediately realized that he was unable to. There was a suppressive force directed downwards, preventing him from rising more than half a meter up from the ground. He was unable to fly in this place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And since the trees in the forest were between two and three meters tall, that meant that he could not rise above them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, was the forest forced to grow like this because of this peculiar pressure?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, there was a loud sound in the distance, and Lu Yin turned around to look. He thought about it for a moment, and then he decided to slowly approach the source of the sound. No matter what, he had to find someone first. He remembered that he had been swallowed by the storm before this. By all rights, he should be dead, but he had no idea where he currently was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t walk for long before the trees ahead started to sway. A wide section of the trees were pushed to either side as a panicked man appeared in front of Lu Yin, and the two stared at each other.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man looked at Lu Yin with delight and frantically pointed behind him. “The- there’s a ghost!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin felt nervous. “A ghost? Are you sure?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man nodded and looked behind him again. He hurried around Lu Yin and continued desperately running away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin turned around, and his expression changed.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be a war spirit? War spirit, war spirit… Yes, it’s definitely a war spirit. If war spirits exist here, then could this be a part of the Astral Combat Academy’s trial zones? No, that’s impossible. That man was clearly middle-aged and wouldn’t be allowed in the trial zones. Not to mention that he’s just a Seeker. That man hasn’t even set foot on the path of cultivation, so there’s no way he could enter the Astral Combat Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If this place was not a part of the trial zones, then where was he? Why were there war spirits present?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The war spirit only had the strength of a <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sentinel</span>, so Lu Yin simply waved his hand and caused it to vanish into lines of runes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The nearby man looked on at the scene and was stumped. He then stared in disbelief at Lu Yin. “You killed the ghost?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin simply replied, “It’s not a ghost. Alright, tell me. Where are we?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man was afraid. “Inside the storm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin frowned. “Inside the storm? And there’s a forest?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a pale face, the man shook his head. “I don’t know! In any case, I was swallowed by the storm, and I woke up in this damned place. I haven’t seen anything else besides that ghost.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man looked at Lu Yin’s cosmic ring and hopefully asked, “Do you have anything for me to eat? There’s really nothing here, and I’ve been starving for a few days.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded, but just as he was about to take something out for the man, an earth-shattering pressure swept across then that caused Lu Yin’s expression to change. He instinctively used the Invisible Aura Technique to conceal his strength and then used his domain to merge into the surroundings. However, the man in front of him was directly smashed into a puddle of blood by the pressure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin forced himself to remain silent and motionless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not too far away, a war spirit streaked by without pausing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin didn’t dare to even look at it, as its pressure far surpassed a Hunter’s. A Hunter realm war spirit; this place was definitely not the trial zones. So, this place was actually inside of the storm? A formation of runes made up a war spirit, so was this place related to the Rune Technology Civilization?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin sighed as he looked at the blood on the ground. If there were Hunter realm war spirits here, then it was possible that even more powerful war spirits would appear. He was in danger, and he had to be extremely careful.&nbsp;</span></p>

Fortunately, not many of them could threaten him, and those that could threaten him, he hid from.</span></p>

Hence, there should be very few cultivators at the Hunter realm and above who had been swallowed by a storm, or it might have been an accident.&nbsp;</span></p>

This person was only a Melder, and he had not died that long ago. A corpse normally would not be enough to attract Lu Yin’s attention, but this person was from the small spacecraft that he had fought with right before being sucked into the storm.&nbsp;</span></p>

This was only possible for him because of his fighting strength that rivaled a Cruiser, but death was a common fate for the majority of people who could not do the same.&nbsp;</span></p>

Just when the war spirit was about to eliminate them all, two figures appeared from different directions and attacked it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

He was the Cruiser who Lu Yin had stunned with Progenitor Wushang’s hide before then being thrown into the storm. “It’s you!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Cruiser was excited to see Lu Yin, and a fierce bloodlust lit up within his eyes. “Alright! I never thought that I would be able to run into you here. The heavens themselves must be allowing me to get revenge for my brother.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin squinted, and he trembled with bloodlust as well. “You people tried to sacrifice others to pave the way for your escape. No matter if it’s your brother or you, death cannot atone for your crimes.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s your turn to die!” the Cruiser bellowed, and his body changed as it became an incomparably firm stone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was stunned, as this change was actually an innate gift. This Cruiser had actually been concealing his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Against a Cruiser with an innate gift, Lu Yin had no plans of fighting him head-on, and Progenitor Wushang’s hide once again appeared in his hand. This thing was a great killing tool.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Abruptly, an earth-shattering pressure swept across both of them, causing Lu Yin and the Cruiser to exchange shocked glances. It was that Hunter level war spirit again, and the two cultivators charged straight at the golden light without hesitation. Any personal grudges were immediately thrown to the back of their minds.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin wanted to conceal himself with the Invisible Aura Technique, but he knew that the Cruiser would not allow him to hide himself that easily. Thus, he could only escape into the distance with the older man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pressure grew even greater, and a chill ran down Lu Yin’s spine. He could sense the war spirit’s aura, and the number of rune lines congregating behind him was increasing as well. The war spirit was about to act, but Lu Yin gritted his teeth as he gripped Progenitor Wushang’s hide. He was in a dilemma, but he was hesitating about whether or not he should throw this thing out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t have much time to think, but then, the Hunter realm war spirit suddenly changed directions and headed for the Cruiser.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was stunned; why had it not attacked him? What could be the reason? Could it possibly be Progenitor Wushang’s hide?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Based on what the monkey had said, Progenitor Wushang and the Rune Progenitor had both reached the Progenitor realm. Perhaps at that level, cultivators had an innate reaction towards the strength that they had left behind, and that might have been what had helped Lu Yin to avoid this crisis.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter the reason, Lu Yin could relax as long as he was not targeted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Cruiser saw the war spirit turn to pursue him, his soul left his body. He was not a Realmbreaker like his elder brother, so he could not challenge a Hunter. He desperately tried to increase his speed in order to escape again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes gleamed, and he did not leave the area. Instead, he maintained some distance from them and followed behind the Cruiser and the war spirit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the forest, a terrifying aura swept across and caused many trees to fall down. In front of the pressure, the Cruiser desperately fled for his life as a war spirit relentlessly chased after him. Even further behind them was Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The space in this location was strangely firm, and not a single one of the three could move by tearing through the void, which caused the speed of all three people to be about the same.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">High above them, the golden radiance became even more dazzling.</span></p>
