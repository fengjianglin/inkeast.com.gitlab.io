 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-dd023572-7fff-188a-1280-62e29afa6968"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s mood fell, and his emotions became more complex. He hoped that Zhuo Daynight had not died, as he had come to this planet specifically to save her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, look! There are so many shooting stars,” Hai Qiqi shouted as she pointed at the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked up, only to see not shooting stars but instead numerous spacecraft, about a hundred in total, and they were all headed in the same direction. There were only two possibilities for such a scenario: they were either all from the same organization, or another massive amount of pyrolyte ore had been discovered, and all of the major powers were sending reinforcements to that area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes flashed. “Alright, let’s go.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi grunted, but she followed Lu Yin towards where all the spacecraft were headed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The landing site of the vessels did not appear to be too far away, but it was actually a great distance. It was even further away than the distance between Northline Flowzone’s mountain range and Pyrolyte Mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin and Hai Qiqi held star essence in their hands as they flew so that they could recover star energy while they moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only a select few could use star essence to recover star energy, as the majority were forced to use star crystals, even those like Northgate Gang. This was enough to show that he was not on the same level as Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they travelled, Lu Yin and Hai Qiqi encountered more groups of Limiteers. Some groups only had three to five members, while the larger groups consisted of dozens of people. Everyone was headed in the same direction, and this confirmed Lu Yin’s suspicions that there was something incredible at their destination.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was another discovery that Lu Yin did not know if he should feel sorrowful or sympathetic about; there were Limiteers who had been taken and forced to become mounts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Planet Pyrolyte had no star energy, and flying constantly consumed one’s star energy. For some, using star crystals to replenish their used energy was too exorbitant, so they had found human mounts. Just as the name implied, they used human cultivators as mounts with the rider sitting on top as they flew.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Lu Yin saw a bunch of people riding human mounts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi looked over in surprise, as it was her first time seeing such a thing. There was a sliver of incomprehension on her face as well, since she was looking at human mounts, which was insanely humiliating. There were also various powerful organizations above the planet observing everything. If it were Hai Qiqi, she would rather die than be treated as a mount, and yet, she saw an entire group of such people right now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why would this happen? Even if it’s to save their lives, when they leave Planet Pyrolyte, these people might still be eliminated by their own organizations,” Hai Qiqi wondered, as she could not comprehend such a thing. The two of them watched the approaching human mounts, as well as the Limiteers riding them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin faintly replied, “Death is certain, but this way, they can at least live for a while longer, and they might even encounter an opportunity to live.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi turned to Lu Yin. “But don’t they value their dignity?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin smiled. “I’ve told you this before. You’ve lived a noble’s life since birth, so you will never understand how scary the bottom can be. Death is a very distant concept for you. You can only see it as an idea and will find it difficult to accept it as a necessary part of life since your father has protected you for your whole life. If you lost your status, you might also experience the desolation and sorrow that come with impending death.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi frowned, remembering the first time she had seen Lu Yin destroy a spacecraft and how those many deaths had affected her. Still, she was an adult, and she could accept such things and had quickly recovered. However, these human mounts were something that she could not understand. What was more important—dignity or life?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin and Hai Qiqi streaked past the mounts, and Hai Qiqi took another glance to observe the human mounts’ expressions, and she discovered that although they appeared lifeless, their faces still held a trace of unwillingness and expectation. They clearly knew that death awaited them, but they kept holding on to a longing for the future. These people had chosen life and had abandoned their dignity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi did not know if they had chosen correctly, but she had no right to judge them since it was their own lives and not hers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She turned back around and took a deep breath. She intended to forget that expression. Suddenly, a blazing inferno swept through the sky and formed a fiery wall that blocked Lu Yin and Hai Qiqi’s path.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two stopped, and they turned around to stare in the direction of the human mounts as that was where the inferno originated from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The human mounts surrounded Lu Yin and Hai Qiqi, and one mount flew out from the center. Seated atop the enslaved Limiteer was one of Lu Yin’s old acquaintances, Jared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Either become a human mount or die. You guys choose,” Jared declared in a low tone as he stared at Lu Yin and Hai Qiqi. They had not been travelling quickly, so they had been mistaken for weaklings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi was caught off guard. These people wanted to force her to become a human mount?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How audacious!” Hai Qiqi involuntarily shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jared raised his brows. “Then you’re dead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin frowned. He had sensed Jared beforehand, but he had not bothered with him as he did not want to become more entangled with the Blaze Realm. Lu Yin had not expected Jared to take a fancy to the two of them, but he had no reason to be polite, so he didn’t waste his breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin raised a hand and unleashed a Spacerender Palm at Jared. The air trembled, and a transparent shockwave swept through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jared’s eyes went wide when he felt the approaching pressure.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not good!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;This person was an absolute powerhouse! Jared dodged as quickly as he could, but he was still too slow. His right shoulder was crushed by the Spacerender Palm’s shockwave as it swept by. The human mount beneath him was flung down to the ground, and there was no doubt that the person was about to die.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin felt no sympathy, as this was the cruelty of the universe. Sympathy could not be exchanged for a person’s dignity, so Lu Yin would simply speed up this person’s approach to the end of his path!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blaze Realm people surrounding Lu Yin and Hai Qiqi all attacked in unison, but Jared barked out, “Stop!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That one Spacerender Palm had been enough for him to realize the disparity between his group and this person. This person was definitely an elite Limiteer and someone whose strength had reached one of the Astral Combat Academy’s Realm Masters. This was not someone who they could deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin grabbed Hai Qiqi and streaked past the cultivators from Blaze Realm, only to appear in front of Jared. Jared’s pupils shrank. “It was my mistake. We’ll leave now.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Lu Yin did not intend to let these people go. Before, when they had been in the giant centipede’s corpse, Lu Yin had wanted to take out Jared, but events had unfolded in such a way that he had never gotten the opportunity to do so. However, now, there was no reason to let this person go. Jared was not the Blaze Realm’s only heir, as he did not possess enough qualifications. Killing Jared would not place any burden on Lu Yin since the Blaze Realm would not be able to do anything even if they did find out that Lu Yin was the killer. As long as Lu Yin did not encounter a terrifying power like the Daynight clan, Hai Dashao’s reputation would be enough to protect him. Thus, Lu Yin did not care about the Blaze Realm at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a bang, and Jared spat out a mouthful of blood. He wasn’t even able to use any of his battle techniques as his organs had already been destroyed. He couldn’t believe what had just happened; how could the disparity between them be so vast?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin leaned towards Jared. “Die in peace.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jared’s eyes changed, as the voice was obviously Lu Yin’s. Jared’s finger trembled. It was no wonder why the disparity between them was so great, as he had encountered the strongest Limiteer in the universe. Unfortunately, Jared couldn’t even make a sound as his body crashed onto the ground below.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The nearby Blaze Realm group was stunned. The strongest out of them all, Jared, had not even been able to retaliate before dying. Who the heck was this guy?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jared’s strength was only above average compared to other Limiteer geniuses, as there were many that surpassed him, and quite a few could even kill him instantly. Lu Yin was not afraid that his identity would be revealed because of Jared’s death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, no one dared to try and stop Lu Yin. He was just about to leave with Hai Qiqi when he suddenly felt his heart palpitate. He looked down at Jared’s corpse to see that it was being burned by an unknown flame. He suddenly thought of the Karmic Flame Sword battle technique. Jared’s body actually contained that ancient flame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a whoosh as a ferocious and terrifying conflagration tore up towards the sky even as it burned the ground. Jared’s corpse completely disappeared as the karmic flames covered the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin felt it was a pity, as he would have tried to retrieve the karmic flame within his body if he had known about it. What a waste.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi was astonished. “What a powerful flame! How did he have such a strong flame?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin did not bother explaining and simply took Hai Qiqi away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Around them, the cultivators from Blaze Realm were lost, as they did not know where to go now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Blaze Realm’s spacecraft that was hovering in space above Planet Pyrolyte, Huo Houye was furious. The strength that the Blaze Realm possessed on Planet Pyrolyte had not been very impressive to begin with, and it had only become more frail with Jared’s death. Huo Houye did not care about Jared’s death, but his death meant that the Blaze Realm had lost a bit more of the karmic flame, which was extremely painful. The Blaze Realm did not have much of that flame left, and every loss was a pity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Has she not arrived yet?” Huo Houye asked sternly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Blaze Realm disciple answered in a trembling voice, “Soon. She’s already in the Outerverse.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Houye’s eyes narrowed. “It’s about time to reveal her identity. It’s not that my Blaze Realm does not possess any outstanding disciples.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The occasional spacecraft continued to drop down from outer space and land in the distance. When Lu Yin brought Hai Qiqi away from the Blaze Realm disciples, the air was faintly reeking of blood, and murderous shouts could be vaguely made out in the distance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those who qualified to participate in the contest on Planet Pyrolyte were all Limiteer elites. Even if they weren’t that powerful, they were still people who were considered experts in the various organizations of the smaller flowzones. Though there weren’t many people here, the entire area had been turned into a battlefield, which went to show how attractive the pyrolyte in this place was. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This area was not part of a mountain range. Rather, it was one of the extremely rarely seen lakes on Planet Pyrolyte. It was a red lake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi’s eyes went wide as she looked at the lake in surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Around the lake, there were at least a thousand Limiteers engaged in a chaotic battle. Even the sky above and the ground beneath the lake were filled with fights, as the battlefield covered a vast area.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin randomly captured a nearby Limiteer to learn more about the current situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This lake is called Pyrolyte Lake, and there’s a lot of pyrolyte ore at the bottom.” The Limiteer male trembled as he stared fearfully at Lu Yin. This person had grabbed him like someone holding a chick, and his strength was too frightening.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even more than Pyrolyte Mountain?” Lu Yin asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Limiteer shook his head. “I’m not sure about that since it hasn’t been thoroughly investigated, but it’s definitely not a small amount of pyrolyte. Even if it can’t compare to Pyrolyte Mountain, it won’t be much less.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin relaxed his hand and allowed the Limiteer to leave. He then surveyed the entirety of Pyrolyte Lake. After that, he released his domain, as he wanted to search for Zhuo Daynight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most of those who had come to seize this area belonged to organizations of the smaller flowzones. Even if there were some people from the Eight Great Flowzones, they were not very strong. There were even fewer geniuses who had comprehended domains, but that didn’t mean that there were none at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Lu Yin’s domain extended further out, he eventually encountered resistance, and even sneak attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin frowned, and looked towards his right, at a location about a thousand meters away from him. In that place, there was a woman standing there, staring at him in provocation. She had also comprehended a domain, which was how she had sensed the expansion of Lu Yin’s domain. She instantly reacted, and she even tried to use her domain to suppress Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was about to act, but from beside him, Hai Qiqi’s lips curled up. Layers of ripples fluctuated in the air before ferociously expanding out and covering almost half of Pyrolyte Lake at once. Not only did the ripples suppress Lu Yin’s domain, it even stifled the few other geniuses who had domains. With just her strength alone, Hai Qiqi had suppressed the entire battlefield.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Across Pyrolyte Lake, quite a few people looked up, overwhelmed with shock. Who the heck had such a powerful domain?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin also looked at Hai Qiqi in surprise. This kid’s domain was quite powerful, and even though it was not at Mu Rong’s forcefield’s level, it should not be that much inferior to Liu Shaoqiu’s still-nubile forcefield. Could this brat have comprehended a forcefield?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That woman provoking Lu Yin was frightened and hastened to escape. If Hai Qiqi’s domain was this powerful, then her strength could naturally also be inferred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pleased with herself, Hai Qiqi raised her head and glanced at Lu Yin, as if waiting for him to compliment her.</span></p>
