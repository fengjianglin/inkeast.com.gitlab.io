Spacecraft descended one after another, quite a few carrying experts from the Eight Great Flowzones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were probably at least two thousand Limiteers gathered across the mountain range, and competition was even fiercer than the fight for Pyrolyte Mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stated, “We’re not leaving. We’re going to stay here.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi pursed her lips, looking guilty. She didn’t even look at Lu Yin as she was feeling incredibly apologetic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Gang and the rest were shocked. “Stay here? You want to wait to die? Those Daynight guys are coming here!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin hung his head. No matter how smart the small fry like him tried to be, there was no way for them to escape from the palm of the powerful. He had understood this very well in the past, and these current events had only reconfirmed those thoughts. Status? Background? All that was nothing. The only thing that Lu Yin could trust in was himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was way too difficult to take control of one’s own fate, and such a task would take a long time to accomplish. At this moment, however, he could at least control the fates of these people. On Planet Pyrolyte, he was invincible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It didn’t matter what the results of the competition for pyrolyte ended up being, as he was destined to become an enemy of all of the large organizations. Perhaps it was his fate to oppose everyone. The Sea King had schemed against him despite being unwilling to meddle in the battles of the Outerverse. There was no way that the Sea King himself would be able to join the battle… In that case, the only thing that Lu Yin could do was ask Leon's Armada for help. Lu Yin smiled wryly. He had no idea that this was how he was going to end up heading towards the Cosmic Sea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn’t worried about whether or not he’d be able to get there safely. While he had no idea how powerful Mister Mu was, that powerhouse should be able to safely send Lu Yin to the Cosmic Sea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin might never be able to return to the quiet life that he had once had after leaving Planet Pyrolyte. Instead, it seemed that the Cosmic Sea and the rumored Neoverse was the destination for him!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that case, he would make the battle on Planet Pyrolyte even more dazzling!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So far, the people from Northline Flowzone had not really attracted much attention because there were far too many cultivators fighting at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin and the rest quietly watched the battle develop from the mountain range. They did not participate in the battle, and nobody tried to attack them either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sometimes, he found things rather difficult to understand. The cultivators from small organizations fought so hard, but in the end, everything would just be taken away by the major powers such the Sword Sect. What was the point in making such a huge fuss?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there were still quite a few smart people. As several spacecraft formed the words, “Stop, unite,” the battles throughout the mountain range gradually settled down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The smaller organizations seemed to have decided upon something, and nearly two thousand Limiteers stopped fighting as they all looked up at the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A spacecraft entered the Planet Pyrolyte’s atmosphere before exploding above the mountain range. A handsome guy came out of the wreckage. He glanced down at everyone and grinned. “I wonder if there’s anyone who still remembers me, Lord Pisces.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone eyed the man. Dark red smoke billowed into the sky, making the entire scene appear rather desolate. There was even a bloody smell wafting about. At this moment, the man seemed like an integral part of the mountain range.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin eyed the man seriously.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This guy is… somewhat strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lord Pisces? I remember now! He’s an ultra-genius who lived a century ago! He once defeated a Cruiser while in the Limiteer realm and entered the Ten Arbiters council back then! He was one of the council members!” someone exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing that explanation, quite a few people remembered hearing about this person, and they stared at him in shock. There were rumors that this guy had become an Explorer long ago, but had not become a Cruiser yet. What was he doing here? And… was he still a Limiteer?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lord Pisces looked up and arrogantly said, “I’m glad that you still remember me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Somewhere in the mountain range, somebody hesitantly spoke up. “He wasn’t in the Ten Arbiters Council. It was the Universal Youth Council back then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A fair number of people glanced at the person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That person stared up at Lord Pisces in fear, but he managed to eke out, “Only the ten members of this era have the right to be called the Ten Arbiters. He was just a Universal Youth Council member back then, so he can’t be considered as one of them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Exactly! The Ten Arbiters Council now is completely different from that of the previous generations. Power is now truly in the hands of the young, and there are also those ten monsters! In the past, the councilors were Realmbreaker powerhouses, but they were nowhere as powerful as the Ten Arbiters of today.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I heard that Arbiter Zhenwu once tore apart the combined attack of quite a few councilors from the past generation. That was the moment that truly set the current generation apart from past ones.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">High up in the sky, Lord Pisces grew serious. The air around him distorted, and a huge shockwave swept across the area, shocking everybody.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cut the crap! I’ve been tasked with organizing you all to fight together against the Sword Sect, Wen clan, and Daynight clan!” Lord Pisces announced loudly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the mountain range, numerous cultivators stared up at the sky as countless spacecraft formed characters to show the positions of the various organizations. There was no point in the present Limiteers fighting amongst each other, as only by banding together would they be able to prevent the major powers from monopolizing all the resources in this place. They were going to have to work together to chase them out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Coincidentally, powerhouses from the Second Grade Hall had also appeared. Kuang Wang walked right to the front; the serious injuries that he had received from Ling Que had mostly recovered by now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the Second Grade Hall was an organization that ranked at the bottom of the Beast Tamers Flowzone, it was still a power that was considered as a part of the Divine Grade Hall. In some sense, the Beast Tamers Flowzone could be considered an organization all on its own—which was the Divine Grade Hall. Beyond that, it had further split itself into the First and the Second Grade Halls. For this reason, the Second Grade Hall could absolutely represent the Divine Grade Hall, which meant that Kuang Wang was actually a powerhouse from the Divine Grade Hall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After seeing Kuang Wang and the others arrive, the cultivators from the other organizations started to get antsy. There was a very large gap between geniuses from these large organizations and ordinary cultivators like them. Even if they had a few geniuses who had comprehended domains or battle force, they still weren’t confident in being able to handle Kuang Wang at all. Everybody couldn’t help themselves from looking at Lord Pisces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lord Pisces slowly landed on the ground, eyeing Kuang Wang and the others. “You’ve already taken a lot of the ore on Planet Pyrolyte. Several organizations have decided to band together, and we’re not going to let you continue on in this way!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kuang Wang looked calm. “You’re an Explorer who reduced your own power level, right? Do you seriously think that you’ll be able to go up against the Sword Sect and the others after paying such a huge price?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lord Pisces looked grim. He had been an Explorer, but he had reduced his cultivation by an entire realm and would never be able to freely enter space again. This was something incredibly cruel for him. Only by guarding this mountain range and achieving some accomplishments would he be able to live out the rest of his life in safety and give his children a chance. While he’d been famous in his younger days, he had never been able to become a Cruiser, which was why he had been reduced to his current state. This was something that he wished for his children to never have to deal with.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He might look arrogant, but he had already given up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The organization that he was part of had promised him that, as long as he was able to retain control of the mountain range, his children would be nurtured by the sect. Thus, he had to do this no matter what.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not the only one standing against the Sword Sect. All of us are,” Lord Pisces declared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind him, about two thousand Limiteers bellowed furiously. It didn’t matter what kind of grudges their organizations might hold against each other. All of that had been temporarily set aside in favor of protecting the mountain range. They all had to work together.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Far in the distance, Xi Yue and the others had also arrived, and they stared at the mountain range in shock. The small organizations had been driven into a corner, but would their efforts be of any use?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even further away, Ling Que and the cultivators from the Wen clan were quickly drawing close, as were those from the Daynight clan and Sword Sect. That mountain range was where most of the cultivators on the planet were gathering, and the most powerful Limiteers had all arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They’re here,” Northgate Gang spoked with a quivering voice as he eyed the crowd coming their way. They were the cultivators from the Wen clan, and Ling Que was at the front.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The arrival of the Wen clan caused the two thousand or so Limiteers to quiver in fear. Rather than the Wen clan, it would be more accurate to say that Ling Que was the one who had caught everybody’s attention.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kuang Wang’s expression changed, and he stared intensely at Ling Que. This person had severely injured him with just one attack, and the man’s strength was unfathomable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lord Pisces’ eye twitched. The most difficult part of his job was right in front of him, but he had a way to deal with him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qing’er and the rest followed behind Ling Que and simply observed the calm mountain range, seemingly ready to fight at a moment’s notice. Things could erupt at any time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can go now,” Ling Que said as he coldly surveyed the area ahead of him. He even ignored Lord Pisces—that person was just an old piece of trash from a century ago. The universe had gone through a revolution since then. After the Ten Arbiters had arrived, the younger generation of modern times had completely transformed compared to the top youths of the past. The two eras were completely different.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, Lord Pisces would have been considered invincible since he was an Explorer who had reduced his realm to the Limiteer realm. Now, however, he was nothing to Ling Que.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lord Pisces could tell that Ling Que was looking down on him, but he managed to control the mounting fury within him. “We can leave, but are you enough to stop Mu Rong on your own?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We can work together—you, me, the two thousand or so cultivators here, as well as everyone from the Second Grade Hall. Shall we work together to first take care of the Sword Sect?” Lord Pisces proposed. This was his true intent, and it was also what the many organizations had agreed on as a plan, though it wasn’t actually a real plan at all. They wanted to bait the major powers into fighting each other, leaving the final outcome up to fate since nobody was confident in defeating either Mu Rong or Ling Que.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These two could not be defeated by mere numbers unless the crowd possessed a group spiritual force attack technique like those wielded by the Daynight clan members. Besides, Ling Que had already experienced one of those attacks before, and he would not be caught unawares again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qian’er seemed interested. They had lost the previous battle, and Mu Rong was not someone who could be defeated by Ling Que alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que narrowed his eyes. Working together? That might be able to work, but resorting to such methods was rather embarrassing for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elsewhere, the people from the Daynight clan arrived. Once again, they attracted everybody’s attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing gazed at the peaceful mountain range and furrowed her eyebrows. Were those pieces of trash actually going to work together?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lord Pisces looked at her and yelled, “Ladies and gentlemen of the Daynight clan, what do you think about working together to defeat Mu Rong? Otherwise, nobody will be able to stop him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing’s eyes flickered, and she glanced over at Ling Que.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He glanced over at her as well. Though neither of them spoke any words, not attacking was an answer in and of itself. They were going to team up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, a sharp aura could be felt off in the distance. The Sword Sect had finally arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu and Liu <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiaoyun&nbsp;</span>were right at the front while Yōu Ye’er was excitedly following behind them. Mu Rong, however, was at the back of the group, looking as calm as ever.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong’s appearance was like a huge rock weighing down on them. Right now, the most powerful Limiteers in the universe had officially gathered at this mountain range.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Above the planet, the large organizations were all looking at the same place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lord Pisces took a deep breath and glanced over at everyone in front of him. He shouted, “Ladies and gentlemen of the Sword Sect, are you trying to take this mountain range?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Xiaoyun eyed the man in the sky. “So what if we are?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lord Pisces looked stern. “You have already gained control of Pyrolyte Mountain, and the ore inside this mountain range should be split evenly between the other organizations. Is the Sword Sect trying to take this ore as well? Aren’t you pushing it too far?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Xiaoyun ignored him, having already understood what was going on at this moment. She simply turned towards Mu Rong. He stepped forward. “If you want to stop me, then I’ll just have to watch you try.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He completely ignored Lord Pisces. From the very beginning, all the plans about banding together had been nothing more than mere talk. What would truly decide everything was a select number of elites.</span></p>
