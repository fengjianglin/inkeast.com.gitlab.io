 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai pointed his folding fan at his head. “I have my own methods. There’s no need to ask any further.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Miss Qing’s eyes flickered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If Miss Qing doesn’t believe in me, you can still leave,” Mr. Bai joked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Miss Qing looked at Lu Yin, which was a waste of her efforts since Lu Yin was still being completely unresponsive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Miss Qing was left with no other choice. “Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai smiled and leaped into the lake, with Lu Yin and Miss Qing following close behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bottom of the lake was very deep, but it didn’t take the three youths very long to reach it. Mr. Bai’s folding fan lightly tapped out against the lake bed, splitting it apart. The resulting fracture created a tremendous suction force that formed into a vortex. The trio followed the natural path of the water and passed through the lake bed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a spatial layer hidden underneath the lake, and as soon as the trio entered it, cracks appeared all around them. Lu Yin’s expression changed.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not good—this space is collapsing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai and Miss Qing also realized this, and they hurriedly charged out of the space. Lu Yin’s speed was even slightly faster than the two of them, and the trio emerged from the space almost as soon as they entered it. There was a thump, and all of the liquid energy in the lake disappeared in less than a moment. The spatial layer then collapsed as a large area of the city broke apart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A short distance away from Lu Yin, Mr. Bai sighed.“Too much time has passed, and that space was frailer than expected. It’s too bad, but the objects inside are definitely gone.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Miss Qing regretfully added, “To own such a residence in this city, and to even construct a hidden space beneath the lake, this place definitely belonged to someone at the level of an elder. What a pity.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin suddenly looked to the east, as a figure had suddenly appeared and started approaching them at high speed. This person glanced at the three of them, but they did not approach any closer and soon left in another direction.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Hunt is nearly upon us, so more and more experts will appear in the Daosource Sect to seize lucky opportunities before the experts at the level of the Realmlings arrive. Let us also do our best to find our own destinies, as there are still other places for us to check.” Mr. Bai led the way.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was astonished; just how many places had this fellow discovered?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Four days later, the radiance on Miss Qing’s futon dimmed, and she vanished in front of the final two just like Huang San had before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During these four days, the three youths had searched through quite a few places, but they had gained no harvest at all. In fact, they had even faced danger on several occasions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to Mr. Bai’s explanations, these destinies had been left behind for countless years, so it was incredibly lucky to even discover them. To actually obtain them was even more unlikely, and just like in the Scripture Pavilion, many youths had visited the Daosource Sect, but only a few had attained anything at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Searching for destiny after coming to the Fifth Mainland’s Daosource Sect is largely dependent on luck. Ever since that ancient battle, what was seizable has already been taken, and the remaining destinies are rarely seen,” Mr. Bai shook his fan as he spoke confidently.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin continued to remain silent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One more day passed, after which Mr. Bai also left. Before he left, he looked at Lu Yin with an impressed look. “You are actually staying here longer than me. Impressive. Don’t forget the time that Fat Bro set for our appointment. We’ll meet at First Divine Gate.” With that, he vanished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stood within the city and observed his surroundings. Without the fatty, the amount of information that he had gleaned from Mr. Bai and Miss Qing was discouragingly little.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During these days with the three other people, Lu Yin had managed to gain a rough understanding of his current situation. At first, he had wanted to capture someone and question them to get a better understanding of things, but he had held himself back out of fear that some mishap might occur. Now felt like the right time to kidnap someone so that he could ask them some rather specific questions.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is perfect, someone’s coming.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From a distance, a man quickly neared Lu Yin. He was the elegant man with whom LuYin and his companions had interacted before. Mr. Bai had let this man off and allowed him to take the others away, and the man had pretended to leave. However, he had actually hidden themselves off in the distance and continued to observe the small group.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that Lu Yin was a domain expert and had kept a great distance out of fear for being discovered. He had followed the group through the tracks that they had left behind, not daring to risk taking a look even once. He only dared to show his face after both Miss Qing and Mr. Bai had left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin turned around and watched as the elegant man approached.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elegant man smiled at Lu Yin. “Brother, you must have enjoyed a pretty decent harvest from these last few days. Take it out and let me have a look.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes narrowed, but he did not speak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elegant man sneered. “Stop acting like an idiot with me. I know that your domain is very powerful, but hasn’t anyone told you that it’s useless to cultivate such a tiny path? Whatever a domain can do, star energy can do as well.” At that moment, a pair of wings appeared on the man’s back as a vague figure manifested behind him. He vanished from sight only to reappear right in front of &nbsp;Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyelids twitched upon seeing such extreme speed. This person had not only hidden his temperament during his battle with Mr. Bai, but also his power. He was very sinister and calculating.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a rumble as Lu Yin unleashed his domain to suppress his opponent. The elegant man’s body sank, and he growled as his skin hardened, which was his innate gift. “I’ve already said that you aren’t my match!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man ferociously charged at Lu Yin, and despite being suppressed by Lu Yin’s domain, he was not restrained at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man moved extremely quickly, and he instantly appeared in front of Lu Yin before grabbing at his neck, intending to end the battle as quickly as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin also raised a hand and clashed with the man, grabbing him tightly. The man sneered and exerted more strength as the hardened areas of his skin extended to cover even the backs of his hands. The ground beneath them gave way, and the two plummeted down together. The man had thought that he would be able to easily gain control over Lu Yin. In his mind, since Lu Yin had such a powerful domain, there was no way for him to match up to the elegant man’s physical strength. However, as he continued to exert his strength, his expression changed greatly, and he looked at Lu Yin with a stunned expression. “You- what’s going on?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes turned cold. “Are you having fun yet?” He then exerted some of his strength through both of his hands, and two cracking sounds rang out as both of the man’s shoulders distorted. The indistinct phantom image behind him quickly dissipated as well. The man howled in anguish, and his pupils shrank as he lashed out with a kick. However, his entire body was suddenly firmly slammed into the ground by Lu Yin, causing him to cough up a mouthful of blood as his eyes nearly popped out of their sockets.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was another thump as Lu Yin’s fist struck the man’s abdomen, the sudden punch launching the man down into the ground. His body curled up, and he involuntarily shuddered from the bouts of intense pain, his face pale.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked down at the man in the crater. He was decently powerful, and had likely recently become a Cruiser. His strength was enough to rival Nightking Gu’s, and he might even be a bit more powerful. Still, he was simply too far behind Lu Yin, especially since he had chosen to compete against him in physical strength. The man was the most confident in his physique, but he had simply chosen the wrong opponent to fight against.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Lu Yin had also needed to divert two of his grains of Fatesand, which had unsealed a good half of his physical power. This elegant-looking man was very terrifying and had been able to force Lu Yin to such a step. Within the Outerverse, it would be difficult to find anyone in the Cruiser realm who could defeat this man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cultivators whom Lu Yin had met during this time in the Daosource Sect were all generally quite strong, and even the fatty’s all-out force would place him within the Top 100 Rankings. That list represented the top one hundred experts of the entire universe’s younger generation, so how were there so many powerful youths in this place? Every single person whom Lu Yin had encountered was someone from the younger generation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He leaped into the crater, moved close to the elegant man, and bent down near him. “Are you dead?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man looked up at Lu Yin with difficulty, and stared at him in disbelief. What kind of monster was this person? His domain was absurdly powerful, but his physical body was also extremely strong. More importantly, Lu Yin had not even used his imprint, which allowed a person to increase their strength even further. The elegant-looking man realized that this person had easily crushed him without relying on his imprint in any way. The difference between them was too great, and this was a strength that only a Realmling could attain. Was this person a Realmling?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you a Realmling?” The elegant man asked hoarsely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll be asking the questions. You can either answer, or you can just go and die,” Lu Yin responded indifferently. There was an iciness in his eyes that terrified the elegant-looking man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ask.” The man gritted his teeth.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t know?” The man was astonished.</span></p>

Fine, I’ll tell you.”&nbsp;</span></p>

Well, this place is the ruins of the Fifth Mainland’s Daosource Sect. During the ancient war, the Fifth Mainland was destroyed, and it merged with the other four Mainlands, as their Daosource Sects have all been abandoned. After that war, the senior powerhouses seized most of the Fifth Mainland’s Daosource Sect’s futons and gave them to their disciples to search for destinies. After that war, many of the futons were sent to various powerful clans as well as those who made certain achievements. Quite a considerable number of futons have also been left behind in the Sixth Mainland’s Daosource Sect and used as rewards.&nbsp;</span></p>

Specifically, the time is linked to one’s spiritual force…&nbsp;</span></p>

Sixth Mainland? With “Mainland” as the main descriptor, each one should not be too large.

Soon, the sound of desperate howls of suffering rang out. When Lu Yin finally released his hands, all of the bones in the man’s arms had been shattered by Lu Yin’s intense grip, and the extreme pain had nearly caused him to faint. He collapsed to the ground and trembled nonstop.&nbsp;</span></p>

They were connected, but are also located a great distance apart. Each mainland has an extremely vast region, which includes countless planets and galaxies. They are, respectively, the First Mainland, the Second Mainland, the Third Mainland, the Fourth Mainland, the Fifth Mainland, and the Sixth Mainland. Each and every one of the mainlands has a Daosource Sect, as they are us cultivators’ origin and end. As time passed, the first four mainlands disintegrated due to unknown causes, and the Daosource Sects in those mainlands all vanished completely. Then, only the Fifth Mainland and Sixth Mainland remained.&nbsp;</span></p>
