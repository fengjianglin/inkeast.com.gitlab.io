They were now deeper, like the vast starry sky, and they held an indescribable dignity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked around some more, and true enough, what he saw now was different. There were more lines, or perhaps they should be called runes. What had happened to his eyes? Before, even when he used his domain, Cosmic Art, and the lockbreaking tool, he still couldn’t see everything that he currently could. Yet, his transformed eyes were able to do it all on their own.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When normal people looked at space, it was just space. Cultivators were able to see the movement of star energy, and their perceptive ability became clearer the stronger they became. Lockbreakers were special in that they could control the flow of star energy and levy their sensitive perception of star energy to unlock sourceboxes. Domain users could also sense such subtle changes in star energy. When Lu Yin had first obtained the Giant Emperor’s third eye, his vision had expanded. When he had first comprehended his domain, the combination of all three had allowed his senses to surpass what many could perceive, and his senses possibly even surpassing the great majority of Lockbreakers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But all of that was different from what he currently saw: runes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin did not know what these runes meant. Could they be some deeper representation of energy?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Also, was there anything wrong with his eyes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He felt an urge to ask the Trialmaster about this matter, but for some unknown reason, he also did not want to inquire too deeply about this matter. It was possible that some changes had occurred to his body but not to others, in which case there would be no benefit in revealing too many of his secrets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin rubbed his eyes and let out a heavy breath. He then looked around.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I can’t always see these lines when looking at things in the future. That’s just unacceptable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he tried to withdraw the star energy from his eyes, the lines disappeared. Sure enough, star energy was the foundation of everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, what did you see when you ascended the Sky Platform?” The monkey was very curious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do you think I saw?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How would I know?” The monkey rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin didn’t bother replying. The stupid monkey only seemed to respond to threats, but the reality was that the monkey understood what he should or should not say. He would not bother concealing things that Lu Yin should know, and he would also not utter a single word about things that he himself should not know.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Luo and the rest had left to give Lu Yin some time to rest. Indeed, he needed rest, and he truly wanted to find out if his eyes had any problems. From where he was resting, he could request the nearby Trialmaster for assistance if the problem persisted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In another corner of the universe, there was a planet covered with layers of enormous cyclones that constantly roamed about. They formed a strong protective net, and there were powerhouses soaring beneath it. The weakest person in this group was an Explorer while the strongest, a man wearing a royal gown, was a Hunter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They appeared to be almost like normal people aside from their exceptionally long legs, which caused each one of them to be over three meters tall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This group of space-exploring powerhouses frantically looked at the skies, and their expressions were filled with expressions of unprecedented worry and terror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Outside the safety net of cyclones, there was a long-haired youth with his hands in his pockets. He leisurely looked down and said, “This is your last chance. Accept the Ten Arbiters Council’s authority in dealing with the trial, education, and oversight of the younger generation in the Cyclone Mainland.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beneath the protective net of cyclones, the middle-aged man in the royal gown spoke in a deafening voice. “Alien, the Cyclone Mainland will never bow to any threats, and it has no wish to interact with the outside world. Please leave.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth raised his head arrogantly, and then rather grudgingly plucked at his hair with his fingers. “Honestly, I wouldn’t normally handle matters in such a dirty manner, but who asked you to appear in my territory.” The youth’s figure then vanished. There was not the slightest change nor any sign of displacement in the immediate nearby space. It was as if that youth had never even been there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd beneath the protective net was stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Where did he go?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next moment, the entire planet trembled. The cyclones that had revolved around the planet for countless years were stripped away, layer by layer, by some invisible strength. The middle-aged man wearing the royal gown squinted, and then suddenly stared at a section of the void in shock. He raised his hand to attack, causing the void to warp. The long-haired youth reappeared, but he didn’t even look back, allowing the Hunter’s attack to land.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Hunter’s attack vanished inexplicably right when it neared the long-haired man. It disappeared without a single trace, and not even a hint of a ripple could be seen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of the powerhouses of Cyclone Mainland were overwhelmed, and their expressions turned to that of shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The long-haired youth turned back around and smirked. “The Ten Arbiters cannot be harmed.” He then raised a hand and aimed at the Hunter, who soon vanished from where he stood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd was stunned; what had just happened?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I gave you guys a chance, but none of you knew how to cherish it. In that case, there’s no need for you all to continue living,” the long-haired youth leisurely commented. There was a faint smile on his face as he looked down at the giant planet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long after, the planet that had tornadoes constantly roaming about it vanished from the universe. It was like a grain of sand had been plucked from a beach; there were no changes whatsoever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The long-haired man seemed bored as he flipped through his gadget. Suddenly, his gaze froze, and he then laughed out loud. “Someone actually managed to successfully climb the Sky Platform. Interesting, I wonder if his eyes have been opened. Perhaps I’ll no longer be alone on this path.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stayed near the trial zone mountain for two days. By then, his eyes no longer felt unwell, which was a relief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During these two days, Coco and the others left him alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Pao and Little Pao had already left Astral-10 and were heading towards the Chaos Flowzone.</span></p>

He respectfully said to the Trialmaster, “Mentor, I would like to ask for some guidance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Trialmaster opened his murky eyes. “Go and get a teleportation stone first. Then you can ask me a question. One teleportation stone per question.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded, as this response was not unexpected. He headed towards the teleportation stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, Astral-10 had three teleportation stones. One had been there from the beginning while the other two had been won by Lu Yin. No one else had managed to win a stone yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Luo and the rest were powerful, but the chances of them being matched up against someone stronger than them in a ported battle was just too high. Lu Yin had also lost many times, to say nothing of Xia Luo and the rest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s ported battle record currently stood at 134 victories to 108 defeats, and his best winning streak had been nineteen matches. His statistics were rather impressive, but that was in the past. Now, after two upgrading his body twice with the strengthening fruits, his power had undergone overwhelming changes. He wanted to raise his winning streak to thirty matches, since that was one way to gain the ability to challenge those on the Top 100 Rankings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was not possible to directly challenge the Top 100 Rankings whenever one wished, and that was because the opponent had the right to reject such challengers. The Astral Combat Academy even encouraged them to reject such challengers so as to preserve the authoritative nature of the rankings. If just anyone was allowed to challenge those on the list as they wished, then it would trivialize matters. The experts on the list would end up being pestered to death since there was no way they could kill everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As such, in general, those who did not qualify would not have their challenges accepted. However, if such a challenge was accepted, then the results would still be valid. If Lu Yin had fought and defeated Northgate Lie, then Lu Yin would have stepped into the Top 100 Rankings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had been thinking of this when he attempted to challenge Northgate Lie. Lu Yin wanted to enter the Top 100 Rankings, but he had let the matter slide after thinking about it. There were benefits that came with a greater reputation, but there were also disadvantages. Those targeting him would use a different level of power against him if he did so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had not been threatened by Northgate Taisui because he had revealed his rather powerful connections. If an enemy wanted to deal with Lu Yin, then they would now also factor in Nightking Yuanjing’s influence, which meant targeting Lu Yin’s connections. If he entered the Top 100 Rankings, then the powers targeting him would send even stronger forces, as people would be attacking not just his connections but also Lu Yin himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being famous wasn’t necessarily all beneficial.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Lu Yin stepped within the range of the teleportation stone, the scenery around him changed as he started a ported battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was no longer that difficult for Lu Yin to rack up a consecutive streak of fifteen matches, as long as his luck wasn’t atrocious. At present, there were no more than a hundred people in the younger generation who could defeat him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his sixteenth battle, when his name turned red, his opponent was actually a Sentinel. Lu Yin was speechless and even felt like he was looking at a sprout.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, the young sprout’s heart collapsed. He became stupefied once he saw that he was facing a red named opponent nicknamed “Seventh Bro.” The Sentinel’s senior had explained what a red name indicated, and had also shared the information with a voice full of dread and worship. Now, he had actually encountered someone with a red name. He cursed internally.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What the-</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;and then his death caught up to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin released a breath since he had snatched another teleportation stone.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not enough. I have to keep going.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seventeenth match, victory. Eighteenth, victory. Nineteenth, victory… Lu Yin quickly matched his previous win streak, but it still wasn’t enough. Soon, he achieved twenty two straight victories. Twenty third, victory…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The floating rock shattered, and the figure before Lu Yin disappeared. He looked up: thirtieth match, victory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had racked up a winning streak of thirty victories, which was one way to be qualified to challenge the Top 100 Rankings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were a few ways to qualify to challenge the experts on the ranking list, and achieving any one of them was enough. This meant that, right now, Lu Yin could challenge someone on the list, as long as he was confident enough to do so.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, the opponent could still reject him, but the meaning behind the rejection was different now. To bystanders, rejecting a challenge from someone who was qualified to issue it meant that the ranker was afraid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As long as one qualified, they could challenge any expert on the Top 100 Rankings at any time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin opened his eyes. Liu Shaoqiu would probably achieve his qualifications soon as well, as his strength was enough to ensure a streak of thirty victories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although there were many in the universe’s younger generation, the differentiation between them was patently obvious. The Ten Arbiters would forever stand at the peak, followed by those on the Top 100 Rankings. It was possible for there to be hidden powerhouses, but there weren’t that many of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was confident that only a hundred or so people in the young generation could defeat him. He estimated there were no more than a few hundred who could defeat Liu Shaoqiu, and they were too sparsely scattered throughout the universe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">More importantly, Liu Shaoqiu and Lu Yin were still just Limiteers. As soon as they became Explorers, even fewer people in the universe would be able to defeat them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were only two more matches left, and Lu Yin would win a teleportation stone if he won the next one, so he continued on and started another ported battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like the match before, the setting for this one was in the sky, and countless giant rocks floated in the backdrop. All around them, white clouds drifted by, making for a very beautiful scenery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A mighty figure appeared before Lu Yin with the words “Second War King” boldly written above his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was shocked by this person’s nickname.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">War King?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;He remembered that one of the Ten Arbiters was known as the War King, but this person actually dared to call himself the Second War King. It was insane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was even more baffling was that Lu Yin’s opponent actually sat down on a rock and leisurely waved at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The meaning was evident—it was an invitation for Lu Yin to attack at will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin squinted and earnestly observed his opponent. With such boldness, this person was either someone who greatly overestimated his own strength or someone who was truly powerful. Which category did this person fall into? Lu Yin could not tell, because he could not feel any hint of danger aura from this person. In fact, he seemed like just a regular human, which was actually even more abnormal.</span></p>
