 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-df3ada25-7fff-50be-4a33-5a999df03a7f"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The activity among the spacecraft in the sky drew even Mu Rong’s attention. Ling Que was the only one who was bullheadedly rushing forward without thinking of anything else. He didn’t even raise his head to look at his surroundings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You guys, shut up.” Another fleet of vessels formed a message, this time from the Sword Sect. Apparently, they couldn’t stand looking at the scene any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Wen family and the Daynight clan were clearly fighting with the number of spaceships that they possessed. From the Sword Sect’s point of view, the other two major powers were making fools of themselves. All three of them were major organizations, so how could they accept this ridiculing act?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it seemed as though the Wen family had secured a decent head start. Over the next period of time, ships continued to form words high in the sky to help guide Limiteers in the right directions and evade danger. The skies above Planet Pyrolyte became quite lively, but a large number of spacecraft were consumed in the process.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Northcastle Weave, Frostwave Weave, and several other nearby weaves received a large number of orders for personal spacecraft. Even the Great Yu Empire received orders for an astounding number.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gavin, the finance minister of the Great Yu Empire, was delighted. The Great Yu Empire had numerous vessels whose models had long since become obsolete stored away, and Gavin quickly arranged for all of them to be sold to Northcastle Weave. He was prepared for a windfall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One would expect that Planet Pyrolyte would soon become a graveyard for spacecraft as countless ships continued to crash down into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, Wen Qichen had already ordered someone to take a spacecraft and go after Ling Que. He was planning on stopping the Limiteer and telling him he was heading in the wrong direction. Wen Qian’er and the others had received a warning as well, so they had temporarily stopped moving towards Pyrolyte Lake. As long as Ling Que arrived at the lake, Pyrolyte Lake would belong to the Wen family. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Nightqueen Qiuyu kept sending more spacecraft down and creating more confusing words and phrases, Wen Qian’er remained steadfast and did not act. This was because the Wen family’s reinforcements had already reached Planet Pyrolyte and enlightened her to the situation. Wen Qian’er was currently scolding Ling Que to death in her heart; their forces had almost fallen for a trap and been wiped out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Wen family had sent at least thirty people after Ling Que in hopes of stopping him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin watched this grand show take place, but he soon lost all interest. Someone had come up with a strange idea, and now, countless vessels were being used to form words in the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A day later, Ling Que finally sensed that something wasn’t right and came to a stop.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why haven’t I haven’t arrived at Pyrolyte Lake?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were dozens of people from the Wen family and the Daynight clan around him as they fought fiercely. The Daynight clan was afraid that Ling Que would be found and be guided to Pyrolyte Lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que activated his detector and tried to find some pyrolyte within the local vicinity. If there was pyrolyte, then there would definitely be people there as well. He then took off in a different direction. Though he still wasn’t running in the correct direction, at least he wasn’t running away from the lake anymore. More importantly, he was running towards some Wen family members. Also, Ling Que finally saw that there were spacecraft in the sky spelling out words.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What’s going on?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qichen heaved a heavy sigh of relief. Ling Que had finally realized that something was wrong. The Wen family elder felt incredibly tired, even more exhausted than if he had fought against Nightqueen Qiuyu. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin and Hai Qiqi were now very close to Pyrolyte Mountain. They had searched for more than a day, but they still hadn’t found Zhuo Daynight. If they drew any closer to Pyrolyte Mountain, then there was a good chance that Mu Rong would discover them. However, Lu Yin wouldn’t give up. “Qiqi, keep going.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay—wait, what did you call me? Call me Sister Qi!” Hai Qiqi shouted back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Freedom, entertainment.” Lu Yin lightly spoke two words in response.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi obediently continued to spread her forcefield out as she searched for Zhuo Daynight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On Pyrolyte Mountain, Mu Rong suddenly opened his eyes and looked in the direction of Hai Qiqi and Lu Yin. He stood up and took a single step before disappearing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The many disciples of the Sword Sect were surprised since Mu Rong hadn’t left ever since he had helped them gain control of Pyrolyte Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes flickered. It turned out that they couldn’t avoid Mu Rong in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi’s forcefield continued spreading underground. Suddenly, her forcefield distorted, and she looked up with a yelp. She was shocked to see Mu Rong materialize right in front of her, and she immediately hid behind Lu Yin before looking at Mu Rong with cautious eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong stared at Lu Yin. “Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not hostile. A friend of mine disappeared during the battle for Pyrolyte Mountain. I want to find out if they are hiding underground,” Lu Yin lightly answered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong looked calm. “No, there’s no one beneath Pyrolyte Mountain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was disappointed. Was she really not there?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why should we believe you?” Hai Qiqi poked her head out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong softly replied, “You can choose to believe my words or not, and you can search by yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After saying those words, he turned around and left. He had only wanted to confirm whether or not the intruder was an enemy, but it had turned out that the people were not hostile. However, after taking a few steps, he stopped and turned around. He carefully observed Lu Yin. “You seem very familiar.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had used the Invisible Aura Technique and even changed his appearance, so even Hunters might not be aware of his identity for a period of time. It was not surprising that Mu Rong had failed to see through his disguise.&nbsp;</span></p>

He stopped thinking about the matter as he returned to Pyrolyte Mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had not expected Mu Rong to leave them be so easily, so he turned to Hai Qiqi and said, “Go ahead and use your full strength to search Pyrolyte Mountain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi agreed and released the full power of her forcefield. This time, not only did Mu Rong sense her actions, but Liu Shaoqiu, who was even further away, did as well. It was a strong forcefield, but it wasn’t threatening. Liu Shaoqiu lifted his head, glanced at Mu Rong, and then did not pay much attention to the forcefield after that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the two of them were protecting Pyrolyte Mountain, unless&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">that</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;person showed up, there was no Limiteer in the current universe who could threaten their control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, Hai Qiqi recalled her forcefield and shook her head. “There’s no one here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s expression became complicated. If Zhuo Daynight really wasn’t at Pyrolyte Mountain, then where else could she be? Had she actually died in such a manner that not even her bones remained?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was the only outcome that Lu Yin could think of. Given Zhuo Daynight’s power and her previous injuries, there was a strong possibility that she had died after being struck by the shockwaves from Mu Rong’s battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin felt helpless, but he had already tried his best. Planet Pyrolyte was massive, so he couldn’t search through it inch-by-inch. At the moment, he planned on going back, finding Zhanlong Daynight, and then asking him about the situation on Shenwu Continent. Afterwards, Lu Yin planned on returning to the Outerverse so that he could contact Nightking Yuanjing and ask the old man to step forward and order the Daynight clan members at Planet Pyrolyte to search for Zhou Daynight. Right, there were also the people from Northline Flowzone who could help him search. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As long as Zhuo Daynight wasn’t dead, she would definitely be found. For now, it was time to go to Pyrolyte Lake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin took Hai Qiqi back towards the lake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In another place, Ling Que rapidly sped towards a distant pyrolyte mine. When he was only about halfway there, a member of the Wen family saw Ling Que and started ecstatically chasing after him while shouting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que glanced at the man, but then he indifferently left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the sky, Wen Qichen almost crushed the spacecraft to pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was what he had been the most worried about. No matter how many people were sent to find Ling Que, they might not be able to find him. And even if Ling Que was found, they might not be able to say a word to him. And furthermore, even if they did speak, he might not hear them. Being extremely fast wasn’t always a good thing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, that same Wen family cultivator managed to catch up Ling Que. The man was quite clever and had similarly detected the location of the nearby pyrolyte mine. The Wen family member managed to come face-to-face with Ling Que, and he told him the story of what happened in the sky for the past day, as well as what the spacecraft writing meant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que was stunned after hearing everything. He hadn’t expected the spacecraft to write words across the sky because of him. He was at a loss as it turned out that he had actually gotten lost and ruined his own image in the process.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the Wen family launched another batch of spacecraft into the sky. This time, the spacecraft all looked like older models. It appeared that the family had hurriedly gathered their ships to arrange them in the words, “Lake Here.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que pursed his lips, and his thoughts became even more complicated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, before he moved out, another group of spacecraft appeared in the sky, also forming the words “Lake Here.” But this time, the words were pointed towards a different direction. Although both of the words were pointing towards the south, one of them was pointing to the southeast and the other the southwest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que was stunned; which was the right direction?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immediately afterwards, another batch of spacecraft was sent out. This time, no words were formed. Instead, they formed an arrow pointing in one direction. Soon, batch after batch of vessels were sent out, each one forming a different arrow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que blankly stared at the sky. There were more than a dozen arrows, so which one was the correct one?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He grabbed the cultivator from the Wen family. Ling Que had become a bit flustered, and he was about to fly into a rage from the humiliation. “Where exactly is Pyrolyte Lake?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Wen family cultivator was also taken aback. He actually didn’t know. He only knew that the lake was to the south, but he similarly couldn’t point out the exact location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">High above the sky, Wen Qichen was anxious. The Daynight clan was too despicable and shameless. They had gone to such lengths to muddle the messages’ meaning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mira was also helpless. Fortunately, at least Ling Que knew that he had been traveling in the wrong direction. At least he could look for the lake by moving towards the two directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que also thought of this, and he quickly carried out this plan. He covered his head and ran towards the south. He would make the Daynight clan pay the price for this embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyue was left helpless. She had tried her best, but Ling Que would definitely end up finding Pyrolyte Lake in the end. He wasn’t stupid, and a fierce battle was unavoidable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Around Pyrolyte Lake, a desolate figure appeared with long fluttering black and white hair.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Daynight clan member saw the person and immediately stepped towards her, “Zhuo Daynight, why have you only appeared now?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This person was Zhuo Daynight. During the battle for Pyrolyte Mountain, she had been buried by the aftershocks of the battle, but luckily, she hadn’t been completely pummeled by the aftermath. She had finally emerged from underground after finding a place to recover. She had then headed for Pyrolyte Lake after seeing the words in the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, if Lu Yin had first gone to Pyrolyte Mountain and then simply gone a bit further south, he would have run into Zhuo Daynight. It was a pity that he had just missed her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight glanced at the man and indifferently walked towards Pyrolyte Lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man snorted coldly. Of the Daynight clan members who had come to Planet Pyrolyte, which of them didn’t know that Zhuo Daynight was a thorn in Nightqueen Yanqing’s side? One of them was a member of the Daynight clan while the other one was a Nightqueen. The clan members naturally knew whom to side with. Besides Zhanlong Daynight helping Zhuo Daynight by stopping an attack from Nightqueen Yanqing, everyone else was anxious for Zhuo Daynight to die. They had personally witnessed Zhuo Daynight being thrown underground, but not a single one of them had moved to rescue her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing and Zhalong Daynight also saw that Zhuo Daynight had arrived at Pyrolyte Lake. Zhanlong Daynight did not pay her arrival any attention, but Nightqueen Yanqing laughed coldly; it was good that the girl had made it. It was impossible to avoid a battle with the Wen family, so Yanqing could just have Zhuo Daynight die at that time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight stood beside Pyrolyte Lake and looked at her reflection in the lake. Perhaps she would never return. She raised her head, and her eyes seemed to see across the endless sky. She saw her parents, her clansmen, as well as the nightmare that she couldn’t shake off no matter what, the nightmare that caused her to be fearful for her entire life.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Father, mother, I’m so tired. I’m sorry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle for control over Pyrolyte Lake erupted a day later. Although the Daynight clan had continued to interfere with Ling Que’s sense of direction, Ling Que had still eventually found Pyrolyte Lake with a simple method; he had grabbed people and interrogated them. A large number of cultivators had ran away from Pyrolyte Lake after the Daynight clan arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Wen Qian’er and the others, they didn’t move any closer to the lake. They were afraid of being wiped out by the Daynight clan, so they had actually started moving further and further away from Pyrolyte Lake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que faced the entire Daynight clan on his own, just like when he had first arrived at Pyrolyte Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing stood in front of Ling Que, pretending to be wronged. “Brother Ling, are you really going to embarrass this little sister? My Daynight clan has always been extremely respectful to Brother Ling and never rude.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que looked at Nightqueen Yanqing’s enchanting face, alluring figure, and her stunning eyes, but his mood was very quickly ruined by the spacecraft flying in the sky. “Your Daynight clan has really screwed around with me this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing grudgingly replied, “This was all for the sake of Brother Ling. The elders in the clan don’t want to make things difficult for Brother Ling, which is why they disrupted you. Does Brother Ling really want to make things difficult for this little sister?”</span></p>
