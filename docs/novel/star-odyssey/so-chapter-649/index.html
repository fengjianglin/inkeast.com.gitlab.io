Lu Yin’s brows lifted, as he had a bad premonition as to what was about to happen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next moment, the two walls of the crevice between the mountains crumbled, and the deafening sound was enough to cause space itself to vibrate, and even the stream broke apart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you doing?” Lu Yin became flustered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Knight coldly replied, “It’s up to you whether or not you want to leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She then leaped up and headed off in a particular direction.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was left with no other choice but to follow her, as such a great disturbance might possibly draw other powerhouses over. It was very likely that, aside from the Realmlings, the Sixth Mainland also had other experts who were able to rival those in the top ten of the Top 100 Rankings. It was likely that those people would also arrive to participate in this battlefield, and it would not be difficult to run into such powerhouses, which would spell trouble for Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This armored woman believed that Lu Yin would not dare to stay behind without her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What did you mean by the area where you arrived?” Lu Yin asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With the futons, it’s possible to arrive in places other than the four mountain gates of the Daosource Sect. The Sierrasea is an independent region, and as long as you pass its trial, you can directly arrive in the Sierrasea the next time you come,” White Knight explained.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Sierrasea?” Lu Yin felt that the name was familiar, and it sounded like something he had heard before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Knight did not explain any further, and she only took Lu Yin along with her as she flew off in a certain direction.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">***</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just outside the ruins of the crevice where White Knight had been recuperating, Nong Zaitian was so frightened by the commotion that his heart almost jumped out of his chest. He had luckily escaped from the previous battle after almost dying at Shang Rong’s hand, only awakening with great difficulty afterwards. Once he was able to move, he had looked for a hidden valley where he could spend a few days hiding while waiting for his time in the Daosource Sect to run out. Who could have expected that, right as he approached a valley, the entire place would collapse! What’s worse, he had sensed a star energy fluctuation that left him shivering in fear, and he had immediately fled atop his hoe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he grabbed his hoe, he felt very indignant. That bastard had actually stolen one of his hoes. What an idiot.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the days when White Knight had been unconscious, a few great battles had broken out in the Daosource Sect. The Blood Homage Realmling, Nan Yanfei, had encountered the Undying Bird of the Fifth Mainland’s Ten Arbiters, but their battle had ended undecided, with the two of them each going their own way after fighting for a while.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Bloodburn Realmling, <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Fa</span>, had run into a blind man who was also one of the Fifth Mainland’s Ten Arbiters, and although he had been severely injured, <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Fa</span> had managed to escape. That blind man had massacred at least thirty cultivators from the Sixth Mainland who had been around the Realmling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The War Martial Realmling, the Toolcasting family’s Toolwielder, had met the Ten Arbiters’ War King, Xing Kai, and their battle destroyed an entire region, though the outcome of their battle also could not be determined. Neither of the two youths could be found in the battlefield after things had calmed down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aside from the Realmlings who had appeared to fight against the Ten Arbiters, quite a few descendants from the Sixth Mainland’s Cosmic Imprinters’ families had also appeared, as well as some powerhouses who were second only to Realmlings, like Butcher. The situation within the Daosource Sect's ruins grew increasingly more intense, and some people had started spreading rumors that even the Secret Progenitor Realmling was about to arrive. If these Realmlings were not able to suppress the Ten Arbiters, then perhaps the various families would have to invite the Daosource Three Skies to take action.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Scripture Pavilion, Autumnfrost Qing’s eyes went wide as he looked at Yan Xiaojing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Previously, when the two of them had entered the Scripture Pavilion, Yan Xiaojing had seemed to have achieved a bit of enlightenment, and so, she had wanted to return to the Scripture Pavilion during this trip as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To Autumnfrost Qing, it would also benefit him if Yan Xiaojing was able to comprehend something, as this woman would definitely feel indebted to him and then belong to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, despite their time in the Daosource Sect being almost up, Yan Xiaojing still had not comprehended anything. Thus, Autumnfrost Qing was feeling a little disappointed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked up to observe his surroundings, and he saw that more than a hundred cultivators had gathered together in the Scripture Pavilion. Most of them had not originally been in the Scripture Pavilion, but because fierce battles had started to rage throughout much of the ruins, most cultivators had been forced to take refuge here, which led to more and more people gathering in the Scripture Pavilion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Scripture Pavilion was not a good place for people to fight as the fluctuations of star energy could easily trigger changes in the ancient characters. Hence, once enough people arrived in the Scripture Pavilion, it was considered reasonably safe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he thought back to the battles taking place outside of this calm region, even Autumnfrost Qing felt a bit afraid. A descendant from a World Imprinter’s family who was as famous as Autumnfrost Qing himself had died only one day ago, and Autumnfrost Qing had only learned of it by listening to some other people’s discussion. The youth had died at the hands of the blind Arbiter, and he had not even been able to retaliate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Autumnfrost Qing had concluded that his strength was not much different from the youth who had died, and he realized that if he had been there instead, he likely would not have survived either.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He decided to come to the Daosource Sect as little as possible during this next period of time. Otherwise, if one of the Ten Arbiters was senseless enough to gamble on attacking the futon plaza, they would all be done for.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, there was one more person atop the ancient character that Autumnfrost Qing was sitting on. It was a young man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Autumnfrost Qing instinctively wanted to take action, but this young man was too close. Hold on, too close? How could he have not sensed this person approaching him? And Autumnfrost Qing had only discovered this young man after he had moved this close to him. Something was off.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sorry to disturb you.” The youth smiled at Autumnfrost Qing and then leaped towards the exit of the Scripture Pavilion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Autumnfrost Qing nodded without speaking as he watched the youth leave the Scripture Pavilion. He looked into the depths of the region, which was where the youth had come from. The further one traveled into the Scripture Pavilion, the more ancient characters they would be able to see, but they would also encounter greater dangers. Few people could safely emerge from the depths of the Scripture Pavilion, but that person had just done it. There was nobody for quite a considerable distance ahead of Autumnfrost Qing, which meant that youth had definitely come from the depths of the Scripture Pavilion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An unfamiliar powerhouse who could step into the depths of the Scripture Pavilion, as well as someone who could approach Autumnfrost Qing without being discovered. He could only think of one possibility for a person at this level of strength. His own power could already be considered inferior to only the Realmlings’, which meant that this young man most likely had the strength comparable to one. There were three Progenitors and nine Realms, and Autumnfrost Qing had at least seen what most of the nine Realmlings looked like, and not one of them had a similar appearance to the young man who had just passed him. This meant that the person was quite likely one of the Fifth Mainland’s Ten Arbiters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he thought of this, Autumnfrost Qing’s body trembled. He had actually crossed paths with one of the Fifth Mainland’s Ten Arbiters, and he had even been that close to the person.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Autumnfrost, what happened?” Yan Xiaojing asked with evident concern as she cast a gentle look over at Autumnfrost Qing from nearby.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Autumnfrost Qing forced a smile onto his face. “Nothing much. Xiaojing, have you comprehended anything?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Xiaojing shook her head. “Sorry, Brother Autumnfrost, for wasting your time.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Autumnfrost Qing was actually rejoicing, as that Arbiter definitely would have made a move if she had actually comprehended anything. “It’s alright. We’ll come back here again next time, even if it didn’t work out this time.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Xiaojing pursed her lips, but she nodded with a smile. “Brother Autumnfrost, you’re really good to me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Autumnfrost Qing smiled, but he still felt rather nervous. He hoped that his time would run out sooner so that he could leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">***</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Knight took Lu Yin through three light pillars, and they did not meet anyone on their way. Finally, they arrive at the foot of a mountain that intermittently appeared and disappeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The top of the mountain before them could not be seen as there were clouds floating around its peak. Additionally, it occasionally vanished from time to time only to reappear later. When Lu Yin heard the sounds of waves enter his ear, he turned around to look behind him and saw that there was a large ocean just past the light pillar. This was the Sierrasea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Lu Yin recalled that Mr. Bai had once mentioned the Nine Mountains and Eight Seas; this should be one of them. According to Mr. Bai, only a Progenitor could split the mountains and seas. The Nine Mountains and Eight Seas represented the nine Progenitors, which in turn represented the Daosource Sect’s greatest land of inheritance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin did not believe that the Daosource Sect had once had nine Progenitors, as if that were true, then they would not have lost to the Sixth Mainland in the past. Still, having one or two Progenitors was possible, and perhaps this mountain really did contain a Progenitor’s inheritance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Knight continued moving on ahead.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin closely followed behind her. “I heard that the Sierrasea has an inheritance from a Progenitor. Are you certain that you want to bring me along?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Anyone can come here, so it doesn’t matter whether I bring you or not. Besides, with your strength, it’s not like you could compete with me over any inheritance.” White Knight did not mince her words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was unwilling to give in. “That might be so for now, but not necessarily in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Knight stopped, looked at Lu Yin, and then seriously responded, “At that time, I’ll kill you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin did not speak again, as he could tell that this woman was serious as this actually involved a top-notch inheritance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, is there really a Progenitor’s inheritance in this place? This monkey doesn’t believe it! How could one be found that easily? It should be known that even up to now, no one who knows where Progenitor Wushang’s inheritance is located, and Progenitor Wushang's hide even causes anyone who glances at it to faint,” &nbsp;the Ghost Monkey said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, acquiring Progenitor Wushang’s inheritance seemed more realistic. However, this place was the ancient Daosource Sect, so perhaps it did contain a Progenitor’s inheritance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the two of them moved forward, they stepped on the white bones that littered the ground, making a cracking sound with every step. The Daosource Sect had survived the ancient war, and every single part of it was littered with white bones. However, these bones had not faded into dust with the passage of time, which proved that all of these bones had once belonged to cultivators who were powerhouses in their own time. Lu Yin was very curious about how many powerhouses the Daosource Sect had housed during its peak, and also how glorious the sect must have been.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them could not see how tall the mountain was or how much area the base covered. Even Lu Yin’s vision that had been enhanced by his cultivation could not clearly see it. This mountain seemed to be a pillar that supported the sky itself, as well as this entire space.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they neared the mountain, they started to see the mountain a bit more clearly, and somewhere high up above their heads, a few continents floated about the sky. As they did not know the height of the mountain, they therefore could not determine how large these floating continents actually were, or what the clouds were covering above them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most magnificent sight within their vision was a crack that split the tall mountain into two halves. It looked like a line that led up to the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Knight suddenly stopped and pointed at the sky. She then indifferently asked, “Do you see that continent?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked up, his sight following the direction that White Knight’s finger was pointing in. “You mean the continent that’s the closest to the mountain?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fly up there. There might be a futon plaza on that mainland, and if you make it there, you can return to the Daosource Sect at that location the next time you come here.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you saying that we’ll be able to arrive at this place?” Lu Yin was astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fly up there. If you don’t, I’ll kill you,” White Knight told him calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why do I have to return here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s an order.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You aren’t qualified to give me orders.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Anyone who belongs to the Ten Arbiters Council, the Council of Astral Academy, or the Outerverse Youth Council-”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, alright, I get it! You’ve already said that three times. Aren’t you tired of it yet?” Lu Yin speechlessly interrupted her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin could clearly feel that she was not too happy about being interrupted. He really wanted to know what expression that exquisitely cute face of hers was making under that helmet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He rubbed his nose and then looked up at the floating continents. “Judging by your tone, it would seem that it won’t be easy to get up onto that mainland. I have no confidence that I’ll make it.” He then leaped up and flew high into the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Knight’s eyes flickered. The reason why she had brought Lu Yin to this place was because it would be extremely difficult for her to obtain the Progenitor’s inheritance by herself, and she needed a helper to do so. She was not too comfortable with the other Arbiters, and she was connected to this person through Wendy Yushan. Also, they had just gone through a life or death situation, which made her reluctantly feel more comfortable with Lu Yin. She could only hope that he would be able to reach that continent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had noticed that Lu Yin was able to withstand a significant amount of spiritual force pressure during her fight with Blood Looney. She believed that he would be able to make it to the futon plaza.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Progenitor represented the peak of cultivation. To many, a Progenitor was the same as the sky. A Progenitor could change the sky, and they themselves also represented the sky. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter if the information regarding the Daosource Sect’s Nine Mountains and Eight Seas was true or false, the mountain ahead of them was definitely a Progenitor’s path that had been established by a genuine Progenitor. Ascending this mountain was the same as scaling the sky, which meant facing the pressure of the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, Lu Yin was experiencing that pressure. The higher he flew, the greater the pressure he felt. This was a suppression on his spiritual force, his physical body, and even on his most fundamental level of life. Truthfully, Lu Yin was no stranger to such suppression, as he had faced it more than just once before. His deepest impression of this kind of pressure came from when he had climbed that mountain in the hidden space with a golden ocean. Back then, he had also climbed a mountain, and he had met Mister Mu at the top. That meeting had allowed Lu Yin to transform his physical body while still in the Limiteer realm, and he had thus become an unequaled Limiteer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, Lu Yin was facing the dignified pressure of the sky. If he had attempted this feat during the ancient era and was able to ascend directly, it was possible that he might be able to see the Progenitor who represented the sky. But now, the only thing that greeted his eyes was the spacious continent.</span></p>
