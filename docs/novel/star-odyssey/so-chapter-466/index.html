Many of them really wanted to support Lu Yin since he was, in a way, one of them. However, it was also a fact that he had almost no chances of winning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xun Jiong looked at Lu Yin with jealous eyes. Under normal circumstances, he should have been the one to receive such treatment. If he had become the Sea King's son-in-law, he would have been the one tearing through the void and traveling about the dome with ease. However, this was a privilege that now belonged solely to Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Halfwillow Lakeside was huge. From the east end to the western most part, the entire area stretched for dozens of kilometers. Regular people wouldn’t even be able to see the other side from one side—only cultivators could.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon seeing Mu Rong’s calm expression, Lu Yin had no idea if it was because the man thought nothing of him, or if it was because Mu Rong simply didn’t care about the duel at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes twinkled, and as countless people watched on, he charged towards the middle of the lake. Across from him, Mu Rong did the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them approached each other with extreme speed. Soon enough, their star energy began interacting and affecting the other, even more so once the two of them met. The lake water was also affected by the clashing star energy, and it sprayed in all directions. Lu Yin lifted a hand and attacked with the Skybeast Claw. Mu Rong easily dodged the attack before using a delicate set of footwork to instantly appear in front of Lu Yin with his wooden flute aimed straight at Lu Yin’s chest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin grabbed at Mu Rong, confident in his physical strength. The moment he managed to grasp the flute, Mu Rong would find it difficult to retrieve. However, Mu Rong seemed to sense the danger. He was completely aware of how terrifyingly strong Lu Yin’s physical body was. But despite this, Mu Rong still dared to take the initiative and engage in close combat. Such a decision showed how confident Mu Rong was in his own battle abilities.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong managed to easily dodge Lu Yin’s attack once again, and he appeared behind his opponent this time. The wooden flute twirled about before heavily striking Lu Yin’s back. However, Lu Yin wasn’t slow either. He merged his Flash and Invisible Aura techniques, which allowed him to move without making a sound or even releasing any star energy, which was quite a surprise to Mu Rong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the middle of the lake, the two of them attacked and dodged each other’s attacks at extreme speed. Numerous afterimages appeared and faded away over Halfwillow Lakeside, and as more and more afterimages appeared, the speed of the two even started to distort the area and heat up the entire lake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even after quite a while, neither of them had actually managed to hurt the other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people gaped, unable to even tell what was going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the previous battles against Zhang Dingtian and Ling Que, Mu Rong had held the upper hand in terms of movement techniques, and he had managed to deal with his opponent’s attacks without much trouble. Ling Que had once said that Mu Rong’s movement technique was called Floating Stride and that it was comparable to a Lockbreaking technique. It was first-rate when it came to dodging and dispersing an opponent’s attacks. Meanwhile, Lu Yin had his domain and Flash Step, both of which he was incredibly confident in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them started moving faster and faster, and a hint of surprise appeared in Mu Rong’s eyes. He was aware that Lu Yin was a Lockbreaker, but even a Lockbreaker rarely possessed such great physical techniques. Mu Rong could understand why Lu Yin had been able to disperse his star energy attacks since Lu Yin was renowned as a genius Lockbreaker. However, he was also able to keep up with his speed? That was a surprise.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Rong’s Floating Stride had not reached its limit yet. Mu Rong increased his speed another notch, intrigued. Even with Lu Yin’s eyes, there was a moment where he lost sight of Mu Rong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t just Lu Yin. Northgate Lie, Qin Chen, Cheng Wu, and the rest of the elites spectating could not see through Mu Rong’s current speed either. He was moving at a speed that was far above what they had ever seen before. He was finally displaying the full power of his Floating Stride.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que felt bitter. Even during the battle with him, Mu Rong hadn’t gone all-out, though he had never needed to reach such a speed. No matter how fast Mu Rong could move, he couldn’t move faster than Ling Que’s Que’s Mighty Slash since the blades could travel through the void. Such a thought gave Ling Que a small amount of comfort.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Above the lake, Mu Rong had already disappeared, as he was just too fast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone gasped. Lu Yin was in danger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes revealed shock and surprise.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong is still able to go even faster? How interesting.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without any hesitation, he moved the grain of Fatesand from his heart to the inner layer of his clothes. This allowed him to keep the Fatesand concealed while still unlocking the true power of his physical body. The moment the wooden flute was about to strike him, a powerful shockwave appeared that spread out in all directions and pushed Mu Rong away. The powerful shockwave caused numerous onlookers around the lake to stop breathing for a moment, nearly suffocating.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huge waves erupted across the lake as the water swirled into the sky. Even the surrounding void became unstable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the level of physical strength that Lu Yin had reached after releasing the first grain of Fatesand. When climbing the Skyfall Cascades, this strength was what allowed him to get past the Xun Clan’s Machinery Art and even defeat the Faceless Man. And now, it was what he was relying on in this battle. Lu Yin still maintained an advantage in terms of speed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Flash Step was a basic movement technique that utilized one’s physical body. The stronger the body, the faster Flash Step was. For the first time ever, Lu Yin fully understood this concept that the Sandmaster had introduced to him from the beginning. In theory, as long as the body kept growing stronger, there was no limit to Flash Step’s speed. Lu Yin even started fantasizing about the day when his speed would even surpass time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin and Mu Rong couldn’t even be seen above Halfwillow Lakeside anymore. The two of them were too fast, and it had reached the point where even Explorers couldn’t see all of their movements. In terms of just pure speed, these two were far and beyond their peers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone held their tongues. They’d all thought that Lu Yin wouldn’t be able to hold out for long. Never in their wildest dreams had they expected the two Limiteers to demonstrate such extreme speed. Also, these two were just too fast; how were they supposed to watch the fight? This made no sense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Michelle and the others were just as shocked. They had no idea that Lu Yin could move so fast, and the two of them fighting above the lake were giving off such immense pressure that it was difficult for the rest of them to even breathe. When had the difference between them and Lu Yin grown so large?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Luo’s eyes lit up as his gaze revealed his admiration.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lulu was quite envious. If she possessed this kind of speed, then she’d be able to beat Grandini with ease.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Far in the distance, Hai Dashao watched on with interest. The fact that Lu Yin, while still in the Limiteer realm, had managed to achieve such speed showed that he wasn’t half bad after all. Within this entire universe, there were only a few people who could do the same. It was no wonder why Starsibyl had asked Lu Yin that question; he really did qualify.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A boom suddenly erupted out, surprising the crowd. Everybody looked at the lake to see water spraying out from the center, where Lu Yin and Mu Rong were now facing each other. Beneath their feet was a gigantic hole surrounded by cracks that reached out into the distance. The lake water was flowing into the still-growing cracks, trickling off somewhere.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the first time that the two had actually made contact while fighting at close range. Based on the marks, Lu Yin hadn’t retreated at all, but Mu Rong had taken five steps back. The victor here was obvious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many weren’t very surprised by the results. In terms of physical strength, it was a given that Mu Rong wasn’t as strong as Lu Yin. Lu Yin could use Thirty Stacks, and that demanded a great deal from one’s body. Few Explorers, and even fewer Limiteers could satisfy those demanding requirements. Lan Yu’s ability to use Thirty Stacks had made him the top of the younger generation in Grayweed Continent, showing just how difficult it was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Where Mu Rong truly excelled was his domain, his forcefield, and also that mysterious farmer boy’s song.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong no longer appeared as calm as he had before the battle. He looked at Lu Yin in shock. “Your body is incredibly powerful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin smiled. “Thanks for the compliment. Let’s go again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong shook his head. “There’s no need for that. I don’t like to attack someone else’s weakness, and while I don’t really care about the results of this battle, it’s still a duel. I need to give it my all. You are strong enough for me to do just that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right after speaking, the lake water flowed back towards Mu Rong, and green grass sprouted at the bottom of the lake and spread across Halfwillow Lakeside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, Lu Yin’s domain collapsed. It was much too weak compared to Mu Rong’s domain, and it had been crushed apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was not the first time Lu Yin had experienced such an overwhelming difference in domains. He clearly remembered the separate dimension with the golden sea where he had fought against the battle soul that had kept its eyes closed. From the very start of that fight, Lu Yin’s domain had been crushed, and it had felt as if the sky had collapsed. Right now, that same feeling had appeared once more.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without his domain, his perception of his surroundings became much weaker. Even worse, he had succumbed to Mu Rong’s domain. Above him was an image of a farmer boy herding cows.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone held their breaths. It had appeared. Now that Mu Rong was using his forcefield, it meant that Mu Rong was taking this fight seriously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Dingtian grew incredibly serious. He’d lost to Mu Rong’s domain. It had felt as if space itself had been expelled from the area and as if the forcefield could affect even the heavens and earth. That unstoppable strength was something that Zhang Dingtian would never be able to forget.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que, too, looked serious. He had split his soul to the maximum degree and created three doppelgangers, which had allowed him to block one attack from Mu Rong’s forcefield. He knew full well how terrifying that one attack had been. For a Limiteer, it was like facing the end of the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And now, Lu Yin was experiencing what the end of the world felt like. The farmer boy was trying to crush him from within Mu Rong’s forcefield. No matter how quickly Lu Yin moved, at this moment, it felt like he was mired in a swamp and was being forced to face the attack head on no matter what. There was no way for him to dodge.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, was there a need to dodge it? Lu Yin looked up. Concerning this battle, he’d never considered how he could dodge or block Mu Rong’s attacks because there had never been a need for such a thing; he could just face it directly, that was how confident he was in his body. No Limiteer could do anything to Lu Yin’s body. Not even Ye Xingchen, who was said to have an innate gift to make stars fall, could do so.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The heavens and the earth collided, and the air was torn asunder, releasing thunderous shockwaves everywhere. Halfwillow Lakeside was destroyed, and water splashed everywhere. Right after that, there was a tremendous pressure wave that caused the nearby audience members to cough up blood. Powerful Limiteers were no exception, and even some Explorers could not help themselves from retreating in order to handle the pressure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Michelle and the others weren’t that close, but they weren’t far either, so they also felt the pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was this a feeling that a battle between Limiteers could give off? While they’d already experienced something similar just two days prior, it was still an incredible sight to behold.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Space had been compressed into a ball of volatile energy that, once it reached the limit, exploded and released a shockwave that could be seen with the naked eye. The scene was even more spectacular than the one from two days before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Dashao narrowed his eyes. Next to him stood Hai Qiqi, who had just arrived in time to see this scene. She covered her mouth in shock and wondered to herself,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Is this really a battle between Limiteers?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the two had been fighting right above the lake, the collision of star energy caused all of the water to evaporate and turn into steam.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the steam dissipated, everybody intently stared at the lake. They first saw Mu Rong, and many saw that he appeared to be both shocked and shaken.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be…?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone turned to look at where Lu Yin had been standing before that had now become an enormous pit. Nobody knew for sure how deep it was, and it might even go deep inside the mountain. However, there was a palm-sized area that still stood tall like a stick. It was an area that had been protected by Lu Yin’s abilities and that had not been destroyed. The man himself was standing atop that pillar and calmly looking at Mu Rong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone sucked in a cold breath. Two days ago, Ling Que had not been able to face this attack with such ease. Everyone remembered that most of Ling Que’s clothes had been torn apart, but what about Lu Yin? There wasn’t even a speck of dust to be seen on him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que took one step forward and glared at Lu Yin in disbelief. How could this person’s body be this powerful? Ling Que’s body was still hurting from that attack. Was there really such a huge difference between them?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que wasn’t the only one who was stunned, as Mu Rong himself was utterly shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin slowly flew into the sky and dispersed his battle force. He had not used his Fatesand and had actually taken that attack on with just his body and battle force. Mu Rong’s attack had been very powerful and had even surpassed an ordinary Cruiser’s attack. In terms of power level, it had perhaps reached 70,000. However, that wasn’t enough to penetrate Lu Yin’s body’s defenses.</span></p>
