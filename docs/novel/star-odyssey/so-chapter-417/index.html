 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-f884ddbe-7fff-84aa-4b6d-2f8f8464cf2b"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mister Mu watched Lu Yin’s five-lined battle force cover his entire body and then nonchalantly commented, “That’s normal. To cultivate to such a degree at your age is not bad, but it’s not top-class either. You lack boldness, so your progress upon this path is limited. To be invincible, you must have both a boundless courage and a spirit that soars above the heavens, but you cannot do this. Besides, this style of cultivation is not something unusual either. Thus, it does not show your destiny.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin withdrew his battle force, and his heart dropped. There were few Limiteers in the entire universe who could reach five-lined battle force, especially at his age. If five-lined battle force was not enough, then this person’s selection criteria for his disciples must be extremely stringent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Still, he did not give up, and next, he released his domain and let it envelop the surroundings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mister Mu frowned. “Crude. This domain holds no concept of being unequaled, and neither does it carry a determination to emerge victorious. It has merely been accumulated from countless battles. No matter how you use it, it’ll just be another pair of eyes. Absolute control within the domain’s is the essence of this method. When cultivated to the peak, users can even include the universe within the bounds of their domain and change the sky. Although you have comprehended a domain, that cannot be considered a fortunate encounter. There are too many in the universe who have comprehended a domain.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s heart sank once again, as this was also useless. However, he had noticed a particular phrase that Mister Mu had used—change the sky. The echoing voices on the island at the end of the Ocean of Death had also mentioned something about “changing the sky,” and the monkey had mentioned it as well, saying that some powerhouse’s journal had recorded the Rune Technology as one sky covering another. Was this saying actually related to domains?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did not dwell on such thoughts at this time, and he glanced at Mister Mu. This person’s perverted selection criteria went far beyond Lu Yin’s imagination, as even a powerful clan such as the Daynight clan only had a few geniuses who had comprehended both battle force and a domain, not to mention five-lined battle force at that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He thought about it for a moment, and then raised his hand and struck out at the void with a Thirty Stacks, Fortyfold Shockwave Palm, causing an intense gale to sweep across the mountain peak. This was his most powerful attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With physical strength as its foundation, such an attack can barely count as the embodiment of your physical destiny, but such a destiny is not that rare either. There are some strange clans in the universe who are blessed with incomparably durable bodies from birth and can easily display One Hundred Stacks once they mature. As a normal person, you’re not bad, but this still cannot meet my standards.” Mister Mu was ruthless in his appraisal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s heart sank again. Even his most powerful strike was useless. Did he have to display his secrets that should not be revealed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mister Mu did not push him, and he only silently looked into the distance, seemingly not concerned with Lu Yin in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin gritted his teeth. His destiny had been determined by the heavens: he had been swallowed by the storm and climbed up this mountain with great difficulty, and now, the person before him seemed to be an unimaginable super powerhouse. He tentatively placed Mister Mu on the same level as Northgate Taisui. He had to seize this opportunity to gain such a powerhouse as his master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After thinking things over, Lu Yin decided to display his Cosmic Art. Although it was not as strong as his Overlaying Stacks Path, it was still a manifestation of his destiny because no one else in the Outerverse could learn such a technique. According to the Trialmaster, the Cosmic Sect greatly surpassed the Daynight clan in power, and no outsider could learn their Cosmic Art.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His only worry was if this person revealed him to the Cosmic Sect, which would be the worst outcome. If such a thing really happened, then he would have to reveal that he had Highsage Leon supporting him, as the Cosmic Sea was independent from both the Outerverse and the Neoverse. The monkey had once mentioned that even the great powers of the Neoverse feared the Cosmic Sea’s Four Pirate Crews. Highsage Leon should be enough to protect Lu Yin, so he would take this gamble.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As nine stars revolved around Lu Yin’s body, Mister Mu’s eyes finally flashed with a glimmer of amazement. “The Cosmic Art, the Cosmic Sect’s most guarded technique. It is not something to be divulged externally, and yet, you still learnt it. Not a bad manifestation of your destiny, but unfortunately, it’s just one portion and the ninth star obviously does not belong to the true Cosmic Art. This version of the technique can be considered as your destiny, and if you had learned the entire version, then I would have immediately accepted you as my disciple. Unfortunately, if you don’t join the Cosmic Sect, you will never be able to learn it.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin released his Cosmic Art and relaxed. From Mister Mu’s tone of voice, it sounded like he was not involved with the Cosmic Sect, so he would keep Lu Yin’s secret. He thought about it, and then said, “Disciple truly wishes to learn the Cosmic Art.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no use in talking to me. Continue,” Mister Mu responded calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was at a loss.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Continue? With what?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;There were some things that he definitely could not reveal, such as his innate gift of the die, the Stonewall Scriptures, the Yu Secret Art, or Progenitor Wushang's hide.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hold on,</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Progenitor Wushang's hide?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes flickered, as he had been holding onto that hide the moment he had been swept into the storm, and he had only placed it in his cosmic ring after he awakened. Also, he had used Progenitor Wushang's hide on that Cruiser down on the beach. Had Mister Mu not seen it?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One’s domain could allow one to clearly perceive their surroundings, and Lu Yin refused to believe that Mister Mu had not comprehended a domain. If this man was at the same level as Northgate Taisui, then he would definitely be able to perceive everything that happened within this space. Hence, there was no need to continue hiding Progenitor Wushang's hide.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin raised a hand. “Mister Mu, can this be counted as destiny?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was holding onto the piece of Progenitor Wushang's hide that he had obtained from the monkey, which was much smaller than his own. He would not reveal the larger piece, as it would be less of a loss to lose the one that belonged to the monkey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mister Mu’s eyes seemed to stir, and he nodded. “Progenitor Wushang’s item can be considered as a sort of destiny. Remember, try your best to not expose it when you are in the heavens, as the astral beasts can sense it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was disappointed, as he had not seen much surprise from Mister Mu’s face. Even Progenitor Wushang's hide was not enough to move this man, and it seemed as if he would not take Lu Yin as his disciple. It appeared that he did not have enough destiny.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin thought about his options.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What else can I reveal?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mister Mu looked up. “A reminder: if I don’t accept you as my disciple, then everything that happened here will be erased from your memory.”</span></p>

He could not accept his memory being altered, as there were already gaps in his memory to begin with. He could accept being severely injured or even dying, but there was no way he would submit to having his memory wiped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s gaze firmed and he resolved to display everything that he had and try his luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He raised his hand and struck out, causing day and night to intertwine. This was the Daynight Punch that he had learned from the Daynight stone of inheritance. Although this move was nearly useless to him, it still showed his destiny since no one outside of the clan was allowed to learn the Daynight clan’s battle techniques.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Mister Mu remained indifferent. “There’s a powerful clan in the Innerverse known as the Daynight clan, and this battle technique should be from them since it displayed day and night intertwined and can harm someone’s spiritual force. Not bad. Learning it is a form of destiny, but it’s not moving enough, and it is far inferior to the Cosmic Art.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior understands. The Daynight Punch is lacking in power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, not lacking in power. Rather, you don’t know how to use it. Any battle technique can have a stark difference depending on the user. When this technique is extremely refined, it can cause the heavens to change colors.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was shocked. Apparently, he had always underestimated the Daynight Punch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mister Mu, with this junior’s destiny, might I become your disciple?” Lu Yin probed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mister Mu shook his head. “It’s not enough.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s brows lifted, and he suddenly remembered what he had seen at the Stargazing Deck—the ancient ships and the appearance of a claw imprint from the heavens. If the Skybeast Claw had appeared in such a scene, then it definitely was not as simple as Undying Yushan had made it out to be. After all, Undying Yushan was a descendant of the Seven Courts’ “Yu” ancient surname. Thus, Lu Yin decided to try the battle technique that Undying Yushan had imparted to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He faced the sky and raised a hand as his palm turned into a claw, and the 108 forms of the Skybeast Claw shook the void as a howl reverberated out. It seemed to be coming from the distant past, and it pierced through the void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mister Mu’s eyes finally seemed to stir again. “A lost battle technique that vanished into the long river of history, but you have learnt it. This can be considered a sort of destiny, but it’s still not enough to become my disciple.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin gritted his teeth. Did he really have to reveal the Stonewall Scriptures? Right, there was still more.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mister Mu, my eyes can see what normally cannot be seen,” Lu Yin said. This was definitely related to the ancient Rune Technology Civilization, and it also meant that his eyes held great combat potential. He only did not know if this person had already taken his mutated eyes into consideration. Since he had been able to climb this mountain, it proved that he had previously come into contact with the remnants of the Rune Technology Civilization, so Mister Mu might have already considered it! But no matter what, he still had to give it a try.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mister Mu looked at Lu Yin’s eyes. “I know. You can see rune lines.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s heart sank as he forced a smile onto his face. Of course, Mister Mu had already known it, and Lu Yin being able to ascend this mountain was quite possibly related to his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Next was his innate gift of the die, the Stonewall Scriptures, or the Yu Secret Art. Lu Yin was in a dilemma.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Which should he choose?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With your age, it’s difficult to receive such destinies. I will not make things difficult for you and will take you on as a nominal disciple for now. We’ll reconsider your status once you decide to reveal greater destinies, but for now, your memory can be preserved.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was ecstatic. “Thank you, Mister Mu. No, thank you, Master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mister Mu nodded and casually waved his hand, causing a very strange lump of what looked like quicksand to appear before Lu Yin. It gave off a hazy radiance as it floated in the void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is a sand that plays with life: Fatesand. This is your Master’s gift to you. This sand is absorbed into the body very much like a formcast model, and it will awaken different abilities in different people. It can make you much stronger or much weaker. It places a very heavy toll on one’s vigor and star energy, but you can choose to use it if you wish.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked at that lump of quicksand in amazement.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fatesand?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;He had never even heard of such a thing before, but he would definitely save it!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In truth, Lu Yin did not understand how rare Fatesand was. It could be said to be an peak precious treasure not only in the Innerverse and Outerverse, but also in the Cosmic Sea and the Neoverse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mister Mu watched as Lu Yin casually stored the Fatesand away, not minding the youth’s actions at all. “Everything that you displayed just now did not include speed.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin promptly replied, “Disciple’s speed technique is called the Flash Step. I’ll show it now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then he used Flash Step and vanished the next moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mister Mu said, “It’s merely alright. You can try to combine that technique with the one you use to conceal your aura. That would achieve the effect of concealing yourself within the void.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s mind seemed to flash, and he looked up in surprise. “Thank you for the advice, Master. Disciple understands.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He then used the Invisible Aura Technique together with the Flash Step. His speed did not change at all, but his presence became even more concealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a simple technique, but it was also very practical. He had not considered using his techniques in such a manner before since Flash used star energy as its foundation whereas the Invisible Aura Technique was used to restrain one’s star energy. These two techniques had opposing effects, but it was not impossible to combine them. Since his star energy control had reached a certain level, he could use some of his star energy to shift a certain distance with Flash Step and then hide the rest of his energy with the Invisible Aura Technique.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was simple in theory, but he had never thought of such a possibility before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mister Mu shook his head. “It’s too burdensome, but it’s enough for you at the moment.”</span></p>
