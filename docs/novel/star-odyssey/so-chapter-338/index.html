 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

A crack appeared in the void, causing the floor to split apart. Zhuo Daynight and the Explorer were both blown backwards at the same time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Explorer grit his teeth and then raised his blade again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight’s gaze turned cold as her sword qi surged, causing countless sharp sounds to echo throughout the spacecraft.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Limiteer who crossed realms to challenge an Explorer could not be considered to be a normal Realmbreaker. Unlike a Sentinel challenging a Melder or a Melder challenging a Limiteer, there was a qualitative difference between a Limiteer and an Explorer. Once one became an Explorer, they would be able to tear the void with every attack because the cycle of their star energy was fundamentally different from a Limiteer’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Zhuo Daynight had not improved from before, then even with her initial-stage domain and Alabaster Apparition Blade battle technique, she would definitely lose out to an Explorer whose power level was over 20,000. But now, she had completely comprehended her domain. Even if she couldn’t defeat an Explorer like this pirate captain, she could still hold her own against him for some time. If the battle was dragged out for lonce enough, since the Daynight clan’s battle technique could damage spiritual force, her possibility of winning would no longer be zero.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she had not encountered a normal Explorer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A pirate plundered many things, and that included battle techniques. This pirate crew had operated for a rather long time, and the captain had received many items as the leader of the crew, especially sword techniques. By slowly amassing and integrating them over a period of a hundred years, he had developed a unique technique that suited himself best. The technique was sharp, ferocious, and crafty as well. A short while later, Zhuo Daynight found it hard to defend herself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a white flash as the pirate captain’s blade overpowered her red sword. The blade’s edge streaked past and forced her sword into the wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The captain stared coldly at Zhuo Daynight. “Leave immediately. Out of respect for the Daynight clan, I won’t kill you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight stared at the Explorer captain, unsatisfied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The captain was apprehensive, as it had not been easy to deal with Zhuo Daynight, and there had even been a strange sense of suppression from start to finish. It almost felt as if his attacks had been completely seen through. The Daynight clan’s sword techniques were also very powerful, and he had only won due to the large disparity between their power levels. In fact, if his power level had just been lower by 5,000 units, he might not have even been this woman’s opponent. The elites from powerful clans were just too abnormal; he was an Explorer with a power level of over 20,000, but he was afraid of a Limiteer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight walked to the wall and grabbed her sword. She pulled it out and pointed it back towards the Explorer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He immediately grew furious upon seeing her actions. “I may fear the Daynight clan, but I won’t lie down and die! Don’t seek out that which is bad for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight continued to point her blade towards the captain without moving. She was currently considering how she should proceed; the disparity between the two was simply too great. There were very few Limiteers in the entire Daynight clan who were true Realmbreakers, and she was not yet one of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You obviously can’t beat him, but you still want to struggle. Do you want to end up severely injured again?” A third voice spoke out, and both Zhuo Daynight and the Explorer captain whirled around to see a beaming Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight was shocked. “It’s you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The captain stared blankly at Lu Yin, as he had forgotten about this person. This person was the greatest threat to him and far surpassed the Daynight woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Long time no see.” Lu Yin waved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, you know her? Hold on, she looks familiar... Wait, isn’t she the chick that Nightking Yanqing used to threaten you?” The Ghost Monkey tried to dig into his memories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight stared at Lu Yin in shock. “Why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin shrugged. “I was passing by, and I saw something familiar.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She knew that he was referring to the Aurora. “I’m sorry, but I can’t return it to you just yet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then buy it. How much are you willing to pay?” Lu Yin teased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her expression turned sour; she was actually broke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That Explorer’s face became even gloomier. From their interactions, he could tell that the two of them obviously knew each other. He saw that they wanted to continue chatting, so he decided to tear through the void in order to escape. To run away from Limiteers, especially Realmbreaking geniuses, the best way was to hide in outer space.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately for the captain, Lu Yin had been keeping an eye on him and would not let him escape so easily. The moment the Explorer tore through the void, Lu Yin took a step forward, and an intense vibration shattered countless metal plates on the pirates’ spacecraft. The ripples that he produced travelled through the void and forcibly knocked the Explorer back onto the ship. He was completely stunned. “Student Lu, we have no animosity towards each other.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m sorry, but you need to die.” Lu Yin’s eyes were cold. His body flashed as he appeared right in front of the captain. He raised his hand and unleashed a Twenty Stacks Fortyfold Shockwave Palm. This had been his strongest attack during the Tournament of the Strongest, but right now, it was just a warm up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s attack did not even fully emerge, but the void had already collapsed as if it had caved in. This was a staggering scene, and the Explorer’s face turned deathly pale. He could sense the terror of this palm, and he knew that he could only evade it since he did not dare to meet it head-on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Lu Yin’s palm could not be dodged that easily. Still, the Explorer captain managed to put his ring armor on at this crucial moment, and it was an Explorer-level armor at that. A defense that was equivalent to two Explorers stiffly resisted Lu Yin’s palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s palm was imprinted into the Explorer’s chest, and the ring armor instantly shattered. Then, a boundless force swept across the void that affected even the heavens as a tremendous gravitational pull came from outside the spacecraft and tried to drag everything out. The Explorer’s eyes went grey; Lu Yin’s palm had gone straight through his armor and crushed his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was obvious that the average person could not resist Lu Yin’s palm, but not even an Explorer at 20,000 power level could either. The power of the attack was too great.</span></p>

He had then forcibly fought against Zi Tie, who was an Explorer realm astral beast with a power level of around 40,000 at the border warfront. There was no need to even mention Lu Yin’s capabilities now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To Lu Yin, this normal Explorer was not even as threatening as a Limiteer genius.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Explorer was killed in body and soul before the Twenty Stacks even completed their explosions, and his body was pulled into outer space.</span></p>

This left Zhuo Daynight completely amazed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damn it!” Lu Yin cried, looking out of the spacecraft with an upset expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight was roused. “What?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I forgot to grab his cosmic ring! There must be quite a bit of money inside.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ghost Monkey could not help himself from interjecting. “Seventh Bro, could you not mention money right now? Damn! You just rescued a girl, and a Daynight girl at that!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle with the Explorer had caused great damage to the pirate spacecraft, and it could only barely continue floating through space. As more time passed, the risk of it crashing before the damaged areas were repaired would increase. However, this did not concern Lu Yin, and he immediately left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you for before.” Lu Yin turned around to speak to Zhuo Daynight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She looked out at the stars. “It was because you saved me, so it should have been done.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin laughed. “I saved you because I injured you. Whatever, what’s done is done. Now, what about my Aurora?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight threw a cosmic ring to him. “This contains my entire fortune.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin casually threw it back to her. “I don’t want it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight could not understand him. “Don’t you urgently need money?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, but I want others’. I don’t want yours,” Lu Yin’s reply was firm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight fell silent.</span></p>

But I’m curious about one thing—why do you specifically seek out and kill pirates?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A chilliness flashed into her eyes. “Because pirates are the most repulsive scum in the universe.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s face twisted. Although her answer was short, he saw a glimpse of the intense hatred in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was curious. “But you can’t overdo it. If I wasn’t here this time, then were you intending on fighting it out with that pirate to the very end?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She looked at him, and her pure face revealed a hint of bewilderment. “Do you think that I’m stupid?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin paused, then replied, “No, not stupid.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then that’s that. I’ll leave if I can’t win. But I have my trump cards as well, and there’s no harm in trying, since the pirates won’t dare to kill me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded. “As long as you know.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She looked at him seriously. “How did you find out the traces of the Third Nightking?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin knew that she would ask him this, as very few outside the Daynight clan would have even heard about the Third Nightking. Only some ancient existences would know about such matters. “I’ve already given Elder Yuanjing an answer to this question.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had a complex gaze. “You used that information to save me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He nodded, and then noticed that her gaze was very strange. It was not joyful, but instead, seemed to be a little remorseful. “What’s the matter?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She shook her head and turned away. “You can go, but don’t forget your promise from before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded. This woman had hidden her worries, but they did not concern him. She had willingly testified for him, which truly moved Lu Yin. In turn, he had done everything to repay her kindness, although it did not involve any romantic emotions. He didn’t have the emotional capacity to worry about this woman’s matters in addition to his own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then I’ll leave now. You should as well, quickly.” After saying that, he left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Lu Yin left, Zhuo Daynight looked up and closed her eyes in agony. “I never thought that I, Zhuo Daynight, would become a sinner of the Dayking bloodline. I’m sorry, Father, Mother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, what’s the matter with that woman? She doesn’t seem very happy that you rescued her.” The Ghost Monkey was seething.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s tone instantly turned cold. “None of your business.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Woah, I’m on your side! I realize that you always vent your anger at me, but I have my own dignity too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin could guess why Zhuo Daynight was unhappy, as the monkey had informed him that the Daynight clan was split into the Dayking and Nightking bloodlines. The Dayking bloodline was controlled by the Sealed Cage Technique and were essentially slaves to the Nightking bloodline. Now that he had revealed information on the whereabouts of the Third Nightking, the Dayking bloodline would never be able to escape from their predicament after the Third Nightking was freed. Blaming him was a very natural response.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Lu Yin could not tell her the truth that it was impossible for the Third Nightking to escape, since he did not know if Nightking Yuanjing had messed with her body or not. Ever since he had learned of the truth about the Daynight clan, Lu Yin had viewed the Nightking bloodline in an unfavorable light, and to some extent, he even detested them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was not delayed that long by the pirates, and he continued on his path through the universe. There were only six days left until the wedding, but he would be able to rush to East San Dios within five days if his current route didn’t change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But there were always infinitely many variables in the universe, and the route was changed yet again, pushing the arrival date back by yet another day.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was a little flustered and could only hope that he would be on time.</span></p>
