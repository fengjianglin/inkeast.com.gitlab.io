His strike pierced the void and scattered upon impact with the Ocean of Death, leaving no waves whatsoever.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kuang Wang looked at him, shocked. “Did you see an illusion?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin did not know how to explain it, as he had not seen an illusion exactly. Rather, he had sensed the gathering power right before an illusion manifested, and that was also what he had just destroyed. “I can sense the appearance of the illusions.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Impossible. No one has ever been able to sense the illusions before they appear.” Kuang Wang immediately denied Lu Yin’s claim. “Perhaps you saw what the illusion wanted you to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others agreed with Kuang Wang’s thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin could not explain himself. The Ocean of Death had a similar origin to the Sky Platform, and his eyes had changed after he climbed it. He had long since seen the rune lines that made up the Ocean of Death, and they were definitely not an illusion. However, he had no way of explaining all this to Kuang Wang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t have to bother about it. In any case, don’t be worried. I can take care of the illusions in advance, so just focus on sailing across the Ocean of Death.” Lu Yin was adamant in this statement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kuang Wang seemed to want to rebut, but he was interrupted by Xia Luo. “It doesn’t matter if Lu Yin is right or not. We can’t change anything. Let’s listen to him, and we’ll just act whenever we see an illusion.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kuang Wang nodded, as Xia Luo had laid out a sound plan. “Alright. Everyone, remember: attack as soon as you see an illusion.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zora was still panicking even while Coco was trying to comfort her. Kuang Wang and Feng Shang both had uneasy expressions as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Xia Luo remained calm, as he seemed to believe Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, this place is haunted,” the monkey said. He hadn’t spoken for a while and could no longer endure the silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked around and unleashed another attack, dispersing some more converging rune lines. This time, they had appeared beside Kuang Wang. For a second, he even believed that Lu Yin was attacking him and nearly retaliated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their side was alright for now, but Shamrock Enterprises and the spirit hunters’ boats had just entered the region with the illusions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin turned around and squinted. The spirit hunters’ boat was currently enveloped by the rune lines, to the extent where he could not even see the people inside, which indicated that a disaster had struck them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, the spirit hunters’s boat quickly capsized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, only the Shamrock Enterprises team remained behind Lu Yin’s team.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not much later, the Shamrock Enterprises’ students also vanished from the Ocean of Death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, only one boat remained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their boat sailed deeper into the Ocean of Death, and soon, two more days passed. Xia Luo eventually became unable to endure it any longer, and Kuang Wang replaced him. Compared to Feng Shang, Kuang Wang could not display as much of his strength in the Ocean of Death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At present, they had been sailing for around five days in total, and the speed of the star energy boat was neither slow nor fast. They had traversed quite an impressive distance during these five days, but the end was still not in sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The water grew more turbid, and looking into the ocean gave one a feeling of being engulfed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin maintained the star energy in his eyes as he vigilantly observed the surroundings, taking action from time to time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kuang Wang and Feng Shang were now certain that Lu Yin truly could sense the illusions as they formed. This puzzled Kuang Wang to no end, as not even Starsibyl could do this; Lu Yin’s success had toppled his understanding of the world. He nearly asked about it several times, but he managed to control himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Xia, you’re very tired. Do you want Coco to give you a jab?” Coco looked at Xia Luo with concern.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Luo shook his head with a smile. “There’s no need, Coco.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Xia Luo, who was always calm, did not dare to allow Coco to stab him with her syringe. Coco, who still had not managed to test out her method of treatment on anyone in the Astral Combat Academy, felt rather sullen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zora couldn’t stand it anymore. “Coco is from the Windrift Hall. Even though her syringe is rather large, it won’t pierce your body. It uses the meridians to treat injuries, which then allows the body to recover faster. It’s an innate gift that’s famous for its treatment in Windrift Hall.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Coco immediately nodded and then expectantly looked back at Xia Luo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Shang could not endure it either. “Actually, your explanation makes things even more horrifying.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zora had already made her best case for Coco.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cute little girl fell silent, as she had not been able to treat anyone in a long, long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Careful, there’s something abnormal up ahead,” Lu Yin suddenly spoke as he stared into the distance. It was the first time such an expression had appeared on his face since the group had started their venture across the Ocean of Death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Shang and the others looked in the direction that Lu Yin was staring in. They shockingly saw a figure walking atop the Ocean of Death, heading straight for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Coco screamed in fear as she stared at the distant figure in terror, while Zora’s face was also deathly white, as if she had seen a ghost. This was the Ocean of Death, but someone was actually walking on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stood up. “That should be a war spirit, but it’s not an ordinary one.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It might be an illusion,” Kuang Wang commented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin could not determine which one it was, because the figure had appeared in the distance and not materialized within his range of vision. It already had a solid figure when he first saw it, and since its rune lines had already appeared before he had noticed it, he could not tell its origins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How do you guys think the illusions are formed? The same way as a war spirit? Are they birthed from former students who came here before?” Xia Luo asked as he stared at the approaching figure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Maybe,” Kuang Wang replied uncertainly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If so, then doesn’t that mean that the illusion has the battle strength of someone who once visited the trial zones, along with a spiritual force attack?” Xia Luo continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His words caused the others to shudder, as they were currently already rather deep into the Ocean of Death. Those who could reach this point had practically all been academy leaders, which meant that their strength was at least that of a Realm Master. A Realm Master powerhouse with a spiritual force attack; they looked involuntarily at Lu Yin. That was basically describing Liu Shaoqiu’s Third Sword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had also thought of that possibility. “Everyone, be careful. From now on, no matter what we meet, whether it’s a war spirit or an illusion, treat it as if you were confronting the strength of Liu Shaoqiu’s Third Sword.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How can we even confront that? We might as well just die!” Kuang Wang was rendered speechless. Aside from Lu Yin, no one else could stand up to Liu Shaoqiu’s Third Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The figure slowly approached them, and they finally made out that it was a war spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It suddenly attacked and targeted the entire group. Its finger shook, and the void suddenly split open to form a sharp edge that sliced forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Shang felt numb. “An innate gift of space—be careful!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin waved a hand and tore the void apart, horizontally separating the space in front of him and clashing against the spatial crack of the war spirit’s attack. A cross-shaped spatial crack appeared above the boat formed from star energy as an enormous pressure descended upon the occupants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin shouted, “Take care of yourselves!” He leaped up using Flash to get close to the war spirit with startling speed. He then raised a hand and slammed it out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This war spirit actually had the rare innate gift of space. Although its exact nature was still unknown, any innate gift that involved space was bound to be annoying, like Darkvoid’s spatial explosions that had even defeated Michelle’s innate gift of the red lotus. Lu Yin had to hurry and destroy this war spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The war spirit had no thoughts, nor did it know what retreat was. As it watched Lu Yin attack, its hands waved again, and the many layers of the void in front of it ruptured to form a mountain range-like forcefield. Lu Yin twisted his body to evade it before appearing behind the war spirit with Flash. He then pressed down with an open palm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Lu Yin felt a sense of crisis overcome him, and he quickly used the Secret Sidestep to change his body’s trajectory. A long spear pierced through the void, striking at where he had just been. Another war spirit appeared close behind him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had unleashed his domain and Cosmic Art together. Now that he could enhance his vision, he no longer needed to use the Giant Emperor’s third eye to use the Secret Sidestep, which was extremely fortunate. Otherwise, he would have been struck by that spear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There are actually two war spirits- No</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">. Lu Yin’s gaze slid past the two war spirits, and he looked back at Feng Shang and the rest. War spirits had appeared inside the boat as well. Coco and Zora had already died, though there were no superficial injuries on their bodies. They had died similarly to those people back in the centipede's body. It was a death resulting from the extinguishing of one’s spiritual force. These figures were war spirits, but also illusions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin clenched his fists and used the Secret Sidestep to approach the two war spirits closest to him. The void before him peeled back again, layer by layer. The innate gift of space was difficult to deal with. However, it was not enough to stop Lu Yin when he used the Secret Sidestep. The spear tip stabbed out at him once again, but this time, Lu Yin did not dodge the attack. As long as he wasn’t caught off guard, these two war spirits were not enough to threaten him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin quickly took care of the two war spirits. After all, they were just Limiteers, and Limiteers could no longer be Lu Yin’s opponents.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Shang and Xia Luo each faced a war spirit, and Feng Shang was performing well. Although Xia Luo was evidently not as strong as the rest of them, he could still barely hold out. Meanwhile, Kuang Wang was trying his best to maintain control of the boat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Lu Yin dealt with the two war spirits in front of him, the battle on the boat no longer held any suspense. The other war spirits were similarly eliminated in short order by Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kuang Wang relaxed. “Four appeared in an instant, and they each had the strength of Realm Masters. That’s just too ruthless.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the boat, Zora and Coco’s bodies had already vanished. They would appear at the coast whenever they reentered the Dao of Heaven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s a pity. We shouldn’t be too far from the other side,” Xia Luo sighed regretfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The closer we get, the greater the danger. I believe that that won’t be the greatest crisis and that there will be more up ahead,” Kuang Wang replied.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin agreed. If the difficulty in crossing the ocean was just this degree, then it would not have been enough to prevent the various monsters of the Astral Combat Academy from crossing over the years. For the Ocean of Death to have become a legend, the danger could not be limited to just these current war spirits, there had to be stronger ones up ahead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side of the ocean, Wu Da hurriedly recorded what had transpired on the Ocean of Death—not only his own experience, but Lu Yin’s and the others as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before the advent of the Wu Da’s tabloid, anything that involved crossing the Ocean of Death had always been very mysterious, and news of it had only ever been shared through word of mouth between friends. But now, his tabloid would remove the veil covering the Ocean of Death’s secrets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not enough, it’s still not enough! We know nothing about what’s in the deeper regions. This info won’t be enough to attract the notice of the stronger students.” Wu Da was distressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While he was standing on the coast of the Ocean of Death, he suddenly noticed Coco and Zora. His eyes lit up, and he immediately ran over to them. “Hello, fellow students. I’m Wu Da.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two girls had endured the headaches caused by their deaths and forcibly reentered the Dao of Heaven. They had appeared at the coastline, just like Kuang Wang had said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Coco looked at Wu Da curiously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zora blocked him from approaching Coco. “You’re the founder of the tabloid, Wu Da. We’ve heard of you before. What do you want?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Da kneaded his hands in embarrassment. “That… How far did you two make it across the Ocean of Death before you died?” After he spoke, he saw Zora’s face sour, and Coco revealed an uneasy expression. He instantly knew that he had misspoken. He immediately changed his tune. “No, I wanted to ask the two of you how far you reached and what you saw. Please rest assured, I won’t take your information for free. If you need anything in the future, you can always come look for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zora calmly replied, “I’m sorry, but we were taken along by our academy’s student leader. Unless he agrees, we cannot divulge anything that happened there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Da licked his lips. “You’re talking about Lu Yin, right? I’m very familiar with him. Rest assured, he definitely won’t have any objections towards you talking to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zora did not believe him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Da continued, saying, “Lu Yin’s the strongest student in the Astral Combat Academy, and he can ruin my life if I lie to you. Tell me, and in future, the two of you will be Wu Da’s younger sisters—No, elder sisters!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zora frowned; this person was really thick-skinned.</span></p>
