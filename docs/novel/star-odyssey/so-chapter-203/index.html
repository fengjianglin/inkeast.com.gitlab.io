 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-7f9e30e6-7fff-58cb-c115-cf63424e7019"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Great Yu Empire, Huo Qingshan and Jue Lang exchanged glances at each other. This Xia Luo was also from the Yu Empire, and he had a similar background to Silver’s. When had the empire become so powerful? Astral-10’s representatives so far, for Three Academies Guarding the Gate, Knocking on the Dragon’s Door, and now Tribute to the Ancestors, had all come from the Great Yu Empire. Even Astral-10’s seeded student was Lu Yin. This was just too strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Neither of them could stop themselves from gazing towards the palace when they thought about this. The crown prince, Dorren Yushan, had tried to investigate Xia Luo’s background when he first passed Astral-10’s entrance exam, but he had been informed that he did not have the authority to do so. Perhaps His Majesty was the only one who could look into Xia Luo’s history.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Undying Yushan was looking up Xia Luo’s background on his gadget, but the display only showed two words: “top secret.” He also had no authority to probe, because Xia Luo’s identity was kept confidential from the entire Outerverse. Undying Yushan sighed as he rubbed his temples. “It looks like quite a few outstanding people came out of the empire over these last few years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Lifeseek Realm, while the various academy leaders sat up atop the tallest peak, the next stage, Tribute to the Ancestors, officially began.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ten selected students each raised a foot and started approaching the ancient incense sticks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The power and effects of these ancient incense sticks was no secret. Descriptions of the incense sticks’ suppressive field that was scarily similar to a domain were widely spread, but even so, it was still shocking for the audience and the students who were experiencing it for the first time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tang’s gaze grew cold when he stepped within the incense sticks’ range. He saw an endless amount of sword qi that tore through the heavens. This was the remnant aura of the ancient elders’ bloodlust. Each sliver of sword qi sliced through the void as they headed towards Liu Tang. Despite this infernal world before him, he steadily moved forward step by step, unwavering and majestic in his bearing as he seemingly walked towards his death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the Astral Combat Academy students approached the ancient incense sticks, each of them felt the pressure on them mounting with every step. By this point, the differences between the students were clear for the audience to see. Of the ten students, the girl from Astral-1, Liu Tang from Astral-2, the Daynight clan members from Astral-3 and Astral-4, Xia Ye from Astral-5, and Xia Luo from Astral-10 were the only ones who were able to steadily take multiple steps forward while everyone else had paused in their march.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Luo’s performance astounded many, as moving forward this smoothly without any breaks as a Melder was really not easy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Silver leisurely stepped out from the valley and stared at the screen in the air. The smile of his lip curved up even wider. “So you cannot resist it either. Some people are born to be powerless while others are destined to be outstanding. Are you the same as me? Let me see it clearly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ancient incense sticks were only a thousand meters away from the students, but they felt as distant as the sky. When Xia Luo and the rest reached the hundred meter mark, they all stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bloodlust emanating from the incense sticks was like a raging torrent, and the remnant auras from the ancient elders meant that the students saw something different from the spectators. At this moment, even the girl from Astral-1 had paused to look at the sky in shock, awed by the scene before her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, the Nalan family spacecraft finally docked at Astral-10’s space station. Lu Yin took the lead to exit as soon as the cabin door opened, followed right behind by Liu Xiaoyun. Only they two were allowed to enter the academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Auntie, I’ll be leaving first,” Liu Xiaoyun said as she waved goodbye to Madam Nalan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin also thanked Madam Nalan again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She smiled, looked at Lu Yin, and said, “I don’t know why, but I have a feeling that you’ll surprise me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I hope so,” Lu Yin replied with a smile of his own. He saw Liu Xiaoyun look back at him, clearly anxious to leave. He immediately walked out towards the teleportation device.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, the two arrived at the trial zone entrance, where they saw the Trialmaster. He didn’t say much and quickly allowed them to quickly enter the trial zone mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Xiaoyun did not say another word as she directly flew to the highest point on the trial zone mountain. She was Astral-7’s Realm Master, and as such, deserved to sit at the highest point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin laughed.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Are all powerhouses this proud?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;His gaze burned as he wondered what expression she would have if he stomped that pride to bits. He was anticipating seeing this Realm Master’s strength for himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, in the Lifeseek Realm, the girl from Astral-1 took the lead and continued approaching her ancient incense stick. Liu Tang was close behind her while the rest successively reached the hundred meters point. None of them stopped for long before steadily continuing on towards the sticks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bloodlust did not cause substantial harm to their body as it only affected the students’ state of mind; however, it tested both their strength of body and of mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a disparity between the personal combat strength of the students that the ten academies had sent out for this stage, but the difference was not huge. The one who had lagged behind the most was Xia Luo, who had stayed outside the hundred meters mark for the longest, but he had still caught up to the other students and was now advancing step by step with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, Lu Yin appeared in a forest within the Lifeseek Realm and looked at his surroundings. He saw some figures streaking towards the east, so he instantly moved in front of one of them, startling him badly. “Student, may I ask where the location for the Astral Combat Tournament is?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a student who had been eliminated during the Knocking on the Dragon’s Door stage and had forcefully endured the mental fatigue from dying to reenter the Lifeseek Realm. He was in a very bad mood and instinctively wanted to scold this person for blocking his path, but then he thought of how this person had strangely appeared before him and realized that the person in front of him might be a powerhouse. “It’s straight east.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thanks,” Lu Yin said with a curt nod before immediately vanishing, leaving behind a thin crack that extended deep into the void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That student was dumbfounded.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What kind of freak is this person? He was so fast that just his speed tore the void apart! He can’t be an Area Master since he’s just a Melder. When did the ten academies have such a freak? Or is he one of the ancient powerhouses who emerged from a frozen slumber?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The student was glad that he had held back and not offended Lu Yin, as he would not be able to return to the Lifeseek Realm if he died a second time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Xiaoyun’s luck was much better than Lu Yin’s, and when she appeared in the Lifeseek Realm, she was not far from the tournament. When she appeared at the highest peak where the other academy seeds were sitting and walked to the seventh seat, the first incense stick had already been lit, and it was emitting a green smoke that rose to the sky. “Astral-1’s entire student body pays their eternal tribute to the forebearers.”</span></p>

He had originally planned to light it as soon as he arrived, but then he paused and looked into the distance. At the same time, many spectators saw a black dot appear in the distance, moving towards the tournament site at a normal speed. It was Lu Yin, who had intentionally slowed down when he neared the tournament site. He directly walked onto the highest peak.</span></p>

Lu Yin pays his respects to my seniors.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kuang Wang was stunned. “You are Astral-10’s leader?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When all ten lines of green smoke billowed into the air, the crowd seemed to hear a bloodlust-filled snarl echo out, as if countless ancient elders were expressing their intent.</span></p>

Well, along with Silver, that is. Astral-10 definitely has more gems to uncover. What a great place!</span></p>

Many focused their gaze on Lu Yin, who had sat down in the tenth seat, as they mocked him. “Astral-10 is really treating everyone as a fool with their play of exhorting a weakling as their leader. The truly strong ones from Astral-10 are Big Pao, Little Pao, Silver, Lulu Mavis, and Xia Luo. Though it must be said, Astral-10 truly isn’t weak.”</span></p>

This child had actually risen to the point where he could now stand face to face with the other academy leaders. Undying Yushan hoped that Lu Yin would be able to handle the pressure, but it was simply too difficult. It was an impossible dream for Lu Yin to compare to the other academies’ leaders after just a year of cultivation at the academy.</span></p>

Without a doubt, that was Lu Yin who was sitting in the tenth seat. This was the difference of just a single year, but he had actually climbed to the peak of the universe’s greatest institution and was representing Earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not many on Earth personally knew Lu Yin, but almost everyone had heard of him. Because of him, the countless cultivators of Earth had been spared from the bleak fate of being sent to a frontier battlefield and were able to continue living on Earth. Lu Yin’s reputation had long since surpassed the Seven Sages, but today, many of Earth’s cultivators finally realized the terror of the universe’s powerhouses for the first time. And on top of that, Yin was now one of those same powerhouses!</span></p>

After the participating students from Astral-3, Astral-7, and Astral-10 joined, that number had grown to a total of 598. After Knocking on the Dragon’s Door eliminated another hundred-some people, there were 434 left. The Astral Combat Tournament’s final stage of drawing lots would take place with these 434 people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The giant incense sticks had burned away as green smoke and vanished, leaving everyone’s gazes to turn to the south, which was right below the high peak where the ten academy leaders were seated. There was a giant field there, and a gale suddenly swept across it, carving the plain into 217 arenas without countless air blades. Each arena was surrounded by an invisible barrier of wind that prevented any attacks from spilling out. The stage of drawing lots would be held here, not far from the highest peak. That peak represented the students’ goal: the ten academy leaders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ten of them represented the Realm Masters of the trial zones, and they also represented the Council of Astral Academy. Even more importantly, they represented the Ten Arbiters Council, as they were the only students who were qualified to directly discuss issues with the Ten Arbiters Council.</span></p>
