Then, it raised its rotten arms and ruthlessly clawed at Lu Yin. However, Lu Yin merely shoved it aside with a casual motion before taking a good look around. This place appeared to be some kind of lab, and there was a massive hole above his head. He had forcefully entered this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were quite a few blue crystals piled up around the lab, which were energy crystals that could assist cultivators in using water-type battle techniques. Some Corpse Kings would eat these to obtain innate gifts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Previously, when he had been on Earth, Lu Yin had encountered one such Corpse King outside of Jinlin. These special Corpse Kings were what the Neohuman Alliance needed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This planet was indeed one of the Neohuman Alliance’s bases.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ground trembled as more ash fell down from above. Lu Yin looked up and saw a considerable amount of rune lines converging. That peak Hunter from Darkstar Gorge had gotten tangled up with the Neohuman Alliance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Any Neohuman Alliance base would not be a simple place, and each one would have at least a Hunter overseeing it. It would not be easy for this Hunter from Darkstar Gorge to wipe out this stronghold.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Corpse King roared again before it snarled at Lu Yin and dashed towards him. Lu Yin frowned and exerted a bit of his strength with one hand to instantly kill the Corpse King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Neohuman Alliance could help Lu Yin deal with the powerhouse from Darkstar Gorge, the Neohuman Alliance itself was one of the human race’s greatest enemies. Any Corpse King that one met had to be taken care of.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin burst out of the lab and looked out. There were more than ten laboratories in a row. He walked past each one, destroying the Corpse Kings within as he went by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he reached the last lab, he looked up. The rune lines had somewhat diminished. This base wasn’t an overly strong one, and even the Hunter protecting it was not a peak Hunter, let alone a Transformed Corpse King. This was evident by the fact that the guardian of this base could not fight off the Hunter from Darkstar Gorge. Thus, Lu Yin decided that he would lend them a hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was only able to take a few steps forward when he suddenly felt his scalp go numb. His domain mysteriously crumbled apart, and an indescribable chill enveloped him, making him shudder uncontrollably. He reflexively filled his eyes with star energy as checked around him before looking down below. He saw an incredible, boundless amount of rune lines. The number even surpassed what Lu Yin had seen from <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Karthika</span>, Lei Long, and Elder Wu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There’s an Enlighter here!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Lu Yin’s pupils shrank.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Damn, there’s even this kind of powerhouse here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin raised a hand to blast through the ceiling up above him, and he hurriedly charged out of the Neohuman Alliance base.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The planet that he was on was very special. At this moment, the magma was being pushed away from the core of the planet, and this phenomenon was not artificially induced by the Neohuman Alliance. When they had first found this planet, it had already been in this state. The main reason why they had chosen this planet as one of their strongholds was because, at the planet’s core, there was something worthy of their study: a dried mummy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This desiccated corpse had existed for countless years and emitted an aura that was able to push the magma back, which had drastically reduced the longevity of the planet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mummy was located at the core of the planet, and Lu Yin was standing a mere hundred meters away from it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the core, the originally immobile mummy suddenly opened its eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ancient bloodline discovered. Mission target confirmed. Kill.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin dashed upwards, away from the lab and towards the upper levels of the base, frantically trying to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, the Hunter from Darkstar Gorge was struggling against the Corpse King Hunter when he saw Lu Yin. He angrily barked, “You can’t escape!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He instantly chased after Lu Yin with his top speed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin turned his head around. He wasn’t trying to look at the Darkstar Gorge Hunter, but rather, further underground. The rune lines had increased yet again. A chill ran down his spine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lu Yin! I want you to shed blood in memory of my father’s brave spirit!” The powerhouse from Darkstar Gorge shouted at Lu Yin. The man had a sinister expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked behind him and gritted his teeth. “Don’t chase me! There’s someone even more powerful behind us. Get rid of him and then we can talk.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Darkstar Gorge expert involuntarily looked down, and his pupils shrank. At the same time, Lu Yin looked back again, and his pupils shrank as well. The monkey shrieked, “RUN, SEVENTH BRO!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin saw as the Hunter realm Corpse King continued to struggle with the man from Darkstar Gorge. Suddenly, the Corpse King’s head was crushed by a mummy-looking thing that had reached out with its hand. The desiccated corpse shook the headless body in its hand away. In the darkness of this underground place, it looked terrifying, as if it were the devil itself. The eyes of the mummified figure were completely colorless, but Lu Yin felt as if they were staring straight at him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s face turned a deathly pale white; this monster was definitely staring at him with the intent to kill him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What’s going on? A freak just appeared out of nowhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expert from Darkstar Gorge went pale as well. He could feel a terrifying aura that surpassed even his father’s. This was a fearsome powerhouse with a power level that exceeded 200,000! His only guess was that this was some freak that the Neohuman Alliance had been studying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin and the Darkstar Gorge man had no time to bicker with each other any more. They turned tail and fled to the surface, crushing the ground in their wake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mummy dropped the Corpse King and then slowly turned around. Its neck gave off creaking sounds, perhaps due to it having remained motionless for so long. Then, its four limbs moved at once; its knees bent down, and with a bang, its entire body shattered the ground it chased after the fleeing figures with an unstoppable energy.&nbsp;</span></p>

He pulled out Progenitor Wushang's hide and shouted, “Hey!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man instinctively looked over and saw the Progenitor Wushang's hide, jolting his brain. He had taken all sorts of precautions up to this moment, but he had been too careless at this crucial junction, falling victim to Lu Yin’s schemes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin did not plan on killing the man, as he just wanted to outrun him.</span></p>

He couldn’t see Lu Yin anymore, and his expression turned livid. He tore the void and stepped through. After all, he was a Hunter who could move through the void.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, right as his other leg was about to enter the void, his back went tight, and an intense pain suddenly filled his body. The next instant, he was able to see his own back,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eh? How can I see my own back? Behind me is that mummy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Darkstar Gorge powerhouse’s neck had been snapped in two and his head tossed away. The mummy hadn’t even stopped for more than a moment before it continuing its mad dash towards the surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A peak Hunter had not even been able to resist, but he was at least fortunate enough not to have suffered in his death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Based on the number of rune lines that the mummy had, Lu Yin knew that the Hunter wouldn’t be able to delay the thing in the slightest. As soon as he arrived on the planet’s surface, he immediately threw out the chest with the sourcebox. After moving some distance away, he tapped out and opened the chest. The sourcebox’s formless danger appeared, and Lu Yin released his domain to search for the Hunter’s Aurora.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, that monster’s here!” the monkey screamed in terror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin gritted his teeth. “Get us into space.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monkey morphed into a shadow and towed Lu Yin off the planet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mummy emerged from underground and into the danger zone of the sourcebox, where it was forced to stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked back behind him and saw that the mummy had been restricted by the sourcebox’s formless attacks. He relaxed slightly as the monkey moved with the greatest speed he had ever achieved to escape.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mummy looked up with eyes that could swallow all light. It focused on the sourcebox inside the open chest. Its eyes moved about before it suddenly leaped up. Lu Yin’s eyes went wide as he stared blankly as the rune lines of the sourcebox’s formless danger inundated the mummy. However, the expected scene of the mummified figure being injured did not occur. The invisible danger that had made Elder Wu and <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> so nervous was not able to harm the mummy in any way.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin went numb. Next, he shot his gun at the mummy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bullets from the gun were not very fast, and any Hunter could evade them if they were prepared. However, the mummy did not bother dodging at all, and the bullet burrowed right into its chest. However, even that turned out to be completely ineffective. The mummy’s body only paused for a moment before it continued its charge towards Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hurry!” Lu Yin felt his hair stand on end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ghost Monkey cried out, “Why are you blaming me now? This is all your fault! You just had to provoke that monster. I’ve even used up all the strength that was meant for my reincarnation, but I can’t outrun this monster.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mummy didn’t move very quickly, but every step that it took transcended space. This was different from tearing through the void, and it was also different from how Tian Hou could merge itself with the void. This was as if the mummy was stepping on top of space itself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he watched the mummy close in on him, Lu Yin had no other choice. He took out the monkey’s small piece of Progenitor Wushang's hide and aimed it at the mummy. When the mummy’s dark eyes saw the piece of skin, its body suddenly stopped, and Lu Yin realized that the hide was effective. He gritted his teeth and tossed the bit of hide onto the mummy’s head, and it just so happened to cover the mummy’s eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Progenitor Wushang's hide could only cause an Enlighter to be stunned for a second or two, and simply shifting one’s gaze was enough to avoid the hide’s effect, and it should be the same for the mummy. The thing only needed to avert its gaze, but fortunately, it was not human, and it didn’t seem to be intelligent. The thing only continued to stare stupidly at the hide. A human would immediately know to move Progenitor Wushang’s hide to the side, but this mummy didn’t.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin could only take this gamble since he had no other choice and this mummy was too strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monkey did not even have time to feel sorry about the loss as he desperately dragged Lu Yin onto a battleship that was still above the planet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Through this manner, the mummy was confined in place with its eyes being covered by Progenitor Wushang’s hide.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battleships ahead of Lu Yin and the monkey fired light beams at them. The monkey bellowed, “Who dares to attack me? This monkey will fight you with everything I have!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of the beast’s potential seemed to surge forth, and he forcibly avoided all of the light beams before charging into one of the battleships and leaving a large hole in the hull.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside the spacecraft, all of the cultivators from Darkstar Gorge charged forward to attack Lu Yin. However, Lu Yin had already donned his universal armor, and he struck out with Thirty Stacks and split the vessel open. One Explorer sliced at Lu Yin with his blade, but Lu Yin easily caught the blade and wrapped his other hand around the Explorer’s neck before throwing him beneath the spacecraft. The man was already beyond dead.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had no time to waste on these people, and his domain expanded as he searched for a personal spacecraft on the ruined battleship. He continuously broke through the walls as he searched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In outer space, outside the battleships, the mummy was still trapped there, motionless. Its eyes were wide open, and it continued to stare at Progenitor Wushang's hide in the same manner as before. Anyone looking at the skin would be stunned, but the mummy didn’t know how to close its eyes nor that it should remove the hide. Thus, it had been trapped in this vicious cycle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin soon found a personal spacecraft. Although it was not an Aurora, its speed was not far behind a radiant-grade Aurora’s. It’s only inferiority was that this vessel could not be upgraded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He sat in the spacecraft and dashed into space, once again setting off towards the agreed upon coordinates to meet with Wendy Yushan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were quite a few battleships in space, but none of them could block his path. Once Lu Yin was struck onto the planet, their encirclement had already been broken.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the people on the battleships watched on blankly, Lu Yin departed in his new spacecraft, and quite a few Explorers appeared around the vessels. They were supposed to protect the battleships, but now that Lu Yin had escaped, they could not report back. They had to find the Hunter who had chased Lu Yin down to the planet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In space, the mummy with Progenitor Wushang’s hide covering its head attracted quite some attention.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few Explorers flew beside the mummy, and their brains felt dizzy when they looked at Progenitor Wushang's hide. They then all fell onto the planet, and in the next moment, a battleship fired its weapons on the mummy. The people aboard the spacecraft had assumed that the mummy had attacked the Explorers and had opened fire in retaliation.</span></p>
