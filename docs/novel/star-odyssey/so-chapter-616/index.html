 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Highness, this is the current draft of the alliance contract that summarizes how the alliance will be created. We have already sent some people out to begin working on the first step and have privately contacted several people. Everything is going smoothly at this moment,” En Ya reported.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin read the contract and summary that En Ya had passed to him. “I’m not very good at this, so you can make the decisions. Shenwu Continent has already joined the Great Eastern Alliance, so please remember to send someone over to them with the contract, and don’t delay.” He was eager for Ming Yan to come to the Great Yu Empire as soon as possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, Your Highness,” En Ya replied.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since Undying Yushan’s death, the Great Yu Empire’s morning meetings had instead been held by the Imperial Cabinet. These meetings were also referred to as “forums,” and the formal meetings were only held when Lu Yin was also present.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, most of the key issues regarding the Great Yu Empire had already been handled; the collaboration with the Nalan family, the creation of the Great Eastern Alliance, the recruitment of more soldiers, and all the other tasks were all progressing smoothly. Hence, Lu Yin didn’t have to worry too much about the empire at the moment. He was busy scanning through his cosmic ring when he suddenly noticed something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the final battle in Ironblood Weave, at Seasons Fort, which was also the first fight that Lu Yin had participated in after becoming an Explorer, he had used his die to learn the Yu Secret Art so that he could contribute more to stopping the astral beasts’ invasion. He had also received a yellow prayer mat when rolling the die at that time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, he had heard some faint chanting, and his body had been instinctively drawn towards the prayer mat. He was sure that it wasn’t an ordinary prayer mat, but he had had no time to investigate it and slowly forgot about it afterwards. This was actually the perfect time for him to take a look at the mysterious item.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took the prayer mat out, and he immediately heard the chanting again. It wasn’t just one person’s voice either, but was rather numerous people chanting altogether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This thing’s a prayer mat, right?” the monkey hesitantly asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin wasn’t sure either. “I think so.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then take a seat. Prayer mats are meant to be sat on,” the monkey suggested. He had also heard the chanting and was very curious about the object.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin sat down upon the prayer mat. Suddenly, a dull, golden light appeared and swirled around him. The chanting kept increasing in volume until space itself distorted. Lu Yin suddenly disappeared along with the prayer mat, though not a single other thing changed in the King Zishan palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin experienced the same sensation that he had felt when entering the Time Stop Space or the mysterious space whenever he rolled Possession, where he would select an orb of light. Thus, he had built up a certain amount of resistance towards these sudden changes. Despite that, he was still stunned when he took a closer look at his new surroundings. What was this place?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It resembled a massive arena, and the weather in this place was amazing as there were clear skies for miles. However, Lu Yin had appeared within ruins where even the ground had cracked in multiple places. Multiple bloodstains had colored the ground a muddy red, and there were even a few bones here and there, giving the entire area an extremely desolate appearance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin used his domain to survey the area and quickly observed that the scenery was the same everywhere. The entire place was cracked and covered with bloodstain, piles of bones, and even some ancient weapons.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is probably an ancient land much like the insides of that ancient centipede’s body,</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Lu Yin surmised.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stood up, turned around, and looked at the futon that was still glowing. Lu Yin hesitated, but he then stored the prayer mat away before starting to walk forward across the cracked ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took a step, but his foot caused the ground to crack further, even shattering a nearby skeleton.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, where are you right now?” the Ghost Monkey yelped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know,” Lu Yin answered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, why do you always appear in all kinds of weird places?” the monkey complained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin bent down and examined the sword that lay next to the shattered skeleton. There were some ancient characters etched upon the blade. “Monkey, take a look at these words.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monkey took a look and curiously commented, “I don’t recognize them, but they still look rather familiar. The style of the writing seems rather similar to the words in the centipede’s body.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So they’re from the same time period?” Lu Yin asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not sure. It would depend on the development of this place’s culture, as written language can evolve quickly or slowly depending on the circumstances.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There wasn’t a single living person within the scope of Lu Yin’s domain, and he couldn’t even find any animals nearby. His eyes looked around with star energy, but he still couldn’t see anything. This was the first time that this had happened ever since his eyes had transformed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin could only start walking towards the towering peaks that he saw off in the distance. Those peaks were a landmark, and if anyone was alive in this place, then they would probably head in that direction as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, let’s head back,” the monkey suggested.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s take a look around first,” Lu Yin replied. He had arrived by using the prayer mat, so he could probably only go back by using the prayer mat as well. It was very strange that a prayer mat could transport him to this place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a while, Lu Yin arrived at the foot of the mountain. There, he saw two huge stone pillars with a sign hung between the pillars. Upon it was carved some words:</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘This is a door, the mountain door.’&nbsp;</span></p>

This place also resembled the arena where he had first appeared; many areas had been destroyed, and there were also random bones here and there.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monkey immediately went silent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After ten more minutes, Lu Yin suddenly halted. He had heard a weird noise that sounded like metal rubbing against metal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin turned to his right and saw that an enormous shadow had suddenly appeared right next to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Is this a metal automaton?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Lu Yin was shocked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thing in front of him had a humanoid shape and appeared to be an automaton constructed entirely from metal. It was nearly three meters tall and had human features, but there were no pupils in its eyes, and its metallic body glinted brightly in the sunshine.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a swoosh, the metal automaton swung its arm at Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin dodged, but even the aftershock of the swing was enough to surprise him. The metal automaton was extremely strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The metal automaton was huge, but it reacted very quickly. It swung at Lu Yin once again, and this time, Lu Yin dodged before kicking at the metal automaton’s abdomen. However, his kick was blocked by the metal automaton’s other arm. There was a loud bang as Lu Yin was forced a few steps backward by the impact. He looked up at the thing in shock; this metal automaton was extremely sturdy, and it was incredibly strong as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, you were pushed back?” The monkey was astonished, as he knew perfectly well how freakishly strong Lu Yin was. On top of that, this metal automaton didn’t even have the aura of a Hunter. At best, it’s strength felt comparable to an Explorer’s. Thus, it was unbelievable that it was physically stronger than Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin clenched his fists, and his expression turned serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The metal automaton didn’t give Lu Yin any time to prepare himself, and it immediately swung its arm down at him yet again, blocking the sun from his eyes. Lu Yin nimbly dodged aside, and he was about to retaliate when he realized that this metal automaton had increased its speed. It was now moving multiple times faster than it had before. Another attack descended from above, and Lu Yin dodged it again. Filling his eyes with star energy was useless in this place, and he needed the aid of a lockbreaking tool to use the Secret Sidestep Technique. However, he hadn’t reached the point where he needed to rely on the technique as he was still able to respond to the automaton’s movements with just his natural agility.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin didn’t retaliate as he wanted to test out the strength and speed of the metal automaton first.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He soon realized that the metal automaton was extremely strong and powerful, and it also moved very quickly. Moreover, it could extrapolate Lu Yin’s weak spots based on his evasive movements. Although it didn’t seem like the metal automaton had any intelligence, it did demonstrate a strong sense of instinct.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a bang, Lu Yin punched the metal automaton’s head in between its attacks. He used the strongest attack that he was capable of without unsealing his grains of Fatesand, and this blow was only barely able to dent the head of the metal automaton.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stared at the metal automaton in shock. His intention had been to send the head flying clean off since this was one of his strongest attacks. Ever since he had become an Explorer, he hadn’t met anyone within the same realm as him who could withstand this attack, and it was easily powerful enough to defeat the person ranked fiftieth in the Top 100 Rankings. And yet, despite that, it hadn’t been enough to defeat this automaton.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The automaton adjusted its head. It soon returned to its original position, after which it attacked Lu Yin again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin frowned and leaped up, suddenly appearing in front of the automaton’s head. “Fiftyfold Shockwave Palm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The metal automaton’s head finally flew away from its body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The metal automaton collapsed to the ground with a loud clunk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin moved forward and touched the metal casing. It was very hard, and he couldn't even dent it with his current strength. He looked up and wondered what sect had created these automatons. This should be the mountain entrance of the sect; could it be that these automatons were used as a test for those who wished to join the sect?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If that was the case, then it would be insane since no cultivator below the Explorer realm could defeat these metal automatons. Even if Mu Rong faced off against one of these metal automatons while in the Limiteer realm, he would have a hard time defeating one. What sect could this be, to use this kind of automaton to test out potential disciples?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A loud noise indicated the arrival of more metal automatons from the surrounding forest. However, there were three of them approaching Lu Yin this time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin immediately ran away as he didn’t have the energy to fight against these metal automatons, not to mention that he didn’t even know how many of them there were.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the metal automatons were fast, they weren’t able to catch up with Lu Yin, and he soon lost them in the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">***</span></p>

Even though he had arrived just a little later than her, that slight delay had become a huge distance between them, and he hadn’t been able to find her anywhere. He had even been surrounded by five First Divine Gate Guardians, and he had almost died there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fine, surround me!

However, when he glanced around him, he saw that there were another two guardians patrolling about a hundred meters away. He wanted to vomit blood and started wondering why there were so many guardians in this area. He had heard that these things had been almost completely destroyed after the war. Could he have run into all of the remaining guardians?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His family had finally managed to use their past contributions to obtain a futon. He couldn’t die here, and he had to marry Xiaojing. &nbsp;</span></p>

The metal automaton had created a huge crater, and he suddenly felt an ominous sensation coming from behind himself. He reflexively bent over as a huge arm swept past his head; just the aftershock itself almost tore his pants apart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang San picked up his pants and rushed towards the base of the mountain. He soon encountered the two First Divine Gate Guardians that had been a ways off from him, and he was still being chased by the five others behind him.&nbsp;</span></p>

He was just an Explorer, and he had never even killed anyone before. Why were they all targeting him?</span></p>
