I already told Arbiter Wen about this matter before, and he asked me not to spread the news. He’s already confirmed that Darkstar Gorge is colluding with the Neohuman Alliance.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Puyu shouted, “This is slander! It’s my own fault that I didn’t realize that Vulture was from the Neohuman Alliance, but this is in no way related to Darkstar Gorge! If Arbiter Wen had truly discovered any evidence that Darkstar Gorge was colluding with the Neohuman Alliance, he would have already taken action.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why do you think Arbiter Wen didn’t take action himself? He was seeking out more secrets related to Darkstar Gorge. Puyu, stop trying to defend yourself,” Lu Yin coldly reprimanded. It didn’t matter whether or not Wen Sansi had managed to uncover any evidence of Darkstar Gorge colluding with the Neohuman Alliance since the Outerverse was still cut off from the Innerverse. Nobody would be able to prove whether or not Lu Yin’s words were true, and furthermore, Vulture had already been proven to be a Corpse King, and this fact alone was sufficient to verify everything that Lu Yin was claiming.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Puyu grew furious. “Lu Yin, don’t try to deal with Darkstar Gorge by pinning the crime of colluding with the Neohuman Alliance onto us!” His battle force burst forth, and it even started turning into a reddish-purple color. Under everyone’s surprised gaze, it stabilized, showing that Puyu had achieved eight lined battle force at this moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After achieving eight lined battle force, Puyu suddenly appeared in front of Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!” He punched at Lu Yin, and his attack was enough to cause space itself to distort, as this was an attack with eight lined battle force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes flashed, and he dodged the attack with the Secret Sidestep Technique. Before anything else could happen, the sky split apart, and a middle aged man walked out. He seized Puyu’s arm, and his terrifying amount of star energy caused Puyu to collapse and even his battle force disintegrated. This person was an Enlighter realm powerhouse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nobody had expected an Enlighter to suddenly appear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Lu Yin had known that this person was coming, as he was the expert who the Hall of Honor had sent over as a witness. Elder Lohar had told Lu Yin that he would send someone over, and he had arrived during Lu Yin’s fight against Puyu. There was no way to hide this man’s rune lines when they were this many.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Enlighter easily defeated and restrained Puyu, leaving the youth unable to retaliate in any way. This was due to the difference between their realms, and this was also the reason why Lu Yin’s record was so impressive, as he had actually killed an Enlighter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Enlighters were cultivators who could influence the entire Outerverse. Even the top ten in the Top 100 Rankings weren’t able to defeat an Enlighter, let alone someone like Puyu. Out of the entire younger generation, it was likely that only the Ten Arbiters were capable of defeating an Enlighter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s reputation had been built by his victories over Enlighters, and this was precisely why he was despised by so many Enlighters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the Enlighter captured Puyu, Lu Yin casually waved his hand and caused the eight lined battle force attack that Puyu had unleashed against Lu Yin to disappear and land on the incapacitated councilor instead. He was being restrained by the Enlighter, and his battle force had dissipated, and so his body was completely unable to withstand his own attack. His organs shattered, and he spat out a mouthful of blood along with some of his innards. His body went limp except for a sporadic convulsion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the Enlighter powerhouse wasn’t able to respond to Lu Yin’s sudden attack against Puyu due to the secret technique that Lu Yin had used.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was difficult for even Enlighter powerhouses to dodge attacks that were employed through secret techniques, and this was how Lu Yin had remained certain that he could threaten an Enlighter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle aged man released his hand, and Puyu continued convulsing even after crumpling to the floor. Even Lu Yin wouldn’t want to try defending against an attack with eight lined battle force without any support, let alone a person with a weaker physique such as Puyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After watching Puyu suffer for a moment, the middle aged Enlighter slowly turned around to look at Lu Yin. “He had already been restrained. There was no need for you to attack him.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin respectfully answered, “That was my fault. His attack threatened my life, and so, I retaliated reflexively. I’m sorry, Senior.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle aged man looked closely at Lu Yin. If Puyu died, he would become an accomplice as well. Puyu wouldn’t have been forced into his current state and would have been able to defend against the attack if the Enlighter hadn’t dispersed his eight lined battle force. “You are truly aggressive and ruthless, just like the rumors.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin could detect the man’s dissatisfaction and helplessly said, “Senior, when I was still a <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sentinel</span>, this person humiliated me and even encouraged someone to steal my fiancée away from me. If I hadn’t taken prompt action, my reputation would have been destroyed back then. This person has moved against me countless times. You can verify that to be true, Senior.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After listening to Lu Yin’s words, the middle aged man was shocked. “No wonder.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His gaze then softened. “In that case, don’t worry about it and leave him be. He’s nothing more than a traitor who’s worked with the Neohuman Alliance. You’ve done a good job, as anyone who cooperates with the Neohuman Alliance must be removed.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I understand. Don’t worry, Senior, I will definitely help with the investigation of Darkstar Gorge,” Lu Yin said respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle aged man’s gaze suddenly turned cold. “Investigation? There’s no need for you to do such a thing. The Hall of Honor has its own methods.” And with that, he disappeared into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin heaved a sigh of relief. Darkstar Gorge was doomed now. Previously, when Elder Lohar had learned that the people from the Shenwu Empire had been working with the Neohuman Alliance, his initial reaction had been to destroy the entire Shenwu Continent. Lu Yin knew quite clearly how the Hall of Honor would act and that Darkstar Gorge wouldn't be given a chance to defend themselves, which was precisely why he wasn’t worried.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin walked over to Puyu and bent down to look at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Puyu’s eyes were filled with blood, and he was convulsing on the ground. There was blood flowing out from the corner of his mouth, and everything about him looked pitiful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bazeer humiliated me on your order back at Zenyu Star. I’ve already dealt with him, so now, it’s your turn,” Lu Yin coldly told him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Puyu spat out a mouthful of blood and looked at Lu Yin with a vengeful expression. “Yo- you- you already knew that he was a Corpse King! You’ve slandered me! You’ll die a horrible death! You’ll die a horrible death!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Back then, you were so much more powerful than me that all it took was a single order from you to cause Bazeer to humiliate me and make my life miserable. Why didn’t you think about what would eventually happen to you back then? It’s your own fault that you ended up like this.” Lu Yin then continued, saying, “Besides, Darkstar Gorge doesn’t have to exist anymore since they wanted to oppose me. They want to stop the formation of the Great Eastern Alliance? What a joke.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Puyu screamed desperately. He then spat out a mouthful of black blood and died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stood up, and his expression became complicated. Puyu had been one of his greatest enemies throughout his cultivation journey. When Bazeer had shown up on Zenyu Star, it had already been set in stone that only one of them could survive in the end. Six years had passed since then, but the matter was finally over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, Puyu wasn’t even Lu Yin’s greatest enemy. His true greatest enemy was one of the Ten Arbiters, or possibly even a few of them. His enemy was the person who had given the order that had led to the loss of seventy two lives just because of their surname. Beyond that, Lu Yin also had also Nightking Qingyu, who had triggered the apocalypse on Earth and caused the planet to fall into a dire situation. There was also Old Gu De who had delayed their passage when they had tried to cross the Astral River. Then there was the Xun family from the Innerverse and many more. Lu Yin would collect his debts from every single person who had ever wronged him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Puyu’s death meant that East San Dios now had a huge problem as there were only two councilors left in this half of the Outerverse Youth Council: namely, Liu Shaoge and Wendy Yushan. Since Wendy Yushan stayed at the Great Yu Empire most of the time, Liu Shaoge was essentially the only person left in a position of authority.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Barley approached Lu Yin and respectfully said, “Representative Lu, Bazeer has committed suicide.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded his head, but he didn’t ask any questions. “What has Liu Shaoge been up to lately?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nothing special. San Dios doesn’t have much influence over the Outerverse powers anymore, so he really hasn’t been doing much of anything,” Barley answered in a respectful tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin glanced at the tower and locked eyes with Liu Shaoge. Lu Yin’s body then flashed as he disappeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Xianzi and the others stared at Puyu’s corpse, which was still on the ground. He had been ranked thirteenth on the Top 100 Rankings, but he had still died such a tragic death. Lu Yin was a truly scary person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside the tower, Liu Shaoge retrieved a bottle of wine from his cosmic ring and poured out two glasses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin soon appeared in front of him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Lu, congratulations on eliminating your enemy.” Liu Shaoge passed one of the glasses of wine to Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin took the offered glass. “I’ve tried this once before on Earth. It’s quite good.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’re both from Earth, so we should help each other out, no?” Liu Shaoge took a sip with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin laughed. “We are on two different paths. I don’t care about where you come from—I only care about who my enemy is.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Lu, do you believe that I’m your enemy or your friend?” Liu Shaoge set his glass down as he questioned Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin set his glass down as well. “What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It feels as though Brother Lu is unfriendly towards me,” Liu Shaoge replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin glanced at Liu Shaoge. “You’re a smart person, so do you have any last words? I can help you deliver your words to Earth. Oh, right. I can also make sure that you’re buried on Earth.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoge laughed and stared off into the distance. He then raised a hand with his palm facing downwards, moving as if his hand could grasp the entire world. “Do you remember that I once asked you a question when you first arrived at San Dios? I want to ask you that same question once again: what do you see, Brother Lu?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin frowned. “I don’t have time for this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoge sighed. “It would seem that Brother Lu’s heart is still not big enough to forgive people.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well, it depends on the person. There’s no point in forgiving someone who betrayed Earth as well as his own people,” Lu Yin retorted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What if I can help you with more matters? For example, the Daynight clan.” Liu Shaoge turned to look at Lu Yin with a heated gaze.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was intrigued by this offer. “What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoge smirked. “Brother Lu, don’t you think that it would be good if you had a spy inside of the Daynight clan? The Innerverse and Outerverse will not remain separated for long, and what you have done in the Outerverse definitely won’t be accepted by the Innerverse’s major forces. You have already interfered with their profits, especially with the formation of the Great Eastern Alliance. You’re trying to help the Outerverse overcome the suppression of the Innerverse, but you’re playing a dangerous game.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I just want to unite the Outerverse so that it can defend itself against enemies.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your enemy is the Innerverse.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, it’s the Astral Beast Domain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoge smiled. “For now, maybe. But what about in the future? A united Outerverse is not something that the Innerverse will tolerate. Brother Lu, you will inevitably end up opposing the Innerverse, and as long as I am the representative of the Daynight clan within the Outerverse Youth Council, Arbiter Zhenwu will trust me. Don’t you think that I can help you with many different matters?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“For example?” Lu Yin looked at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoge didn’t answer and merely smiled. He was too careful and would never say certain things aloud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stared at Liu Shaoge. “It’s possible that you’ll be able to help me in the future, but it’s also certain that you’ll cause me a great deal of trouble. You’re like a venomous snake, capable of hurting both me and my enemies.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Lu, you could try to tame me,” Liu Shaoge replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin shook his head. “What you’ve said so far has already proven that you’re not confident in being able to escape. Now that the Outerverse is cut off from the Innerverse, you no longer have Arbiter Zhenwu’s support, which means that you’re nothing more than an ant to me. I can just send you back to Earth, where I’ll find a good place to bury you.”</span></p>
