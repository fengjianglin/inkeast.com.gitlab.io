 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

Do not look at her, speak to her, and watch the surrounding people at all times…” Butler Seven gave Lu Yin a lot of instructions. Before long, Lu Yin went outside and saw Tang Si standing silently in front with a serene expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin lowered his head and quietly moved to stand behind Tang Si. A few other coachmen followed his lead and stood beside Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long after, the princess walked out with a veil covering face and a maid following after her. She glanced at her surroundings curiously, as she hardly ever was allowed to step out of the house. If not for the king sensing her poor mood, he would not have let her out this time either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Yan cherished this opportunity to see the world. Even though Fan City was not big and could not compare to Shanhai City, it was still very exciting to her, and she was delighted with whatever she saw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Si closely followed behind Ming Yan and did not dare to move even half a step away from her. Lu Yin and the other coachmen followed closely behind, and all the items that the princess bought were given to them to carry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was only five meters away from Ming Yan, but Tang Si stood in between the two. Lu Yin dared not approach them for fear that Tang Si would sense something off. Although Lu Yin’s Invisible Aura Technique was effective, he did not want to test its limits since he was not familiar with martial power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Ming Yan was happily strolling about the town, there was a hubbub of activity ahead of them, and Ming Yan was immediately drawn towards it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin and the rest hurriedly dispersed the people in her path and then looked inside the crowd. Lu Yin’s pupils shrank.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What is this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were several burly men in front of them, and they had surrounded a woman and were loudly scolding her and even occasionally punching her. The people around them were all pointing at them, but no one dared to step forward and intervene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Yan pitied the woman and looked at her maid, who then went forward to stop them. Soon enough, the group of people was dispersed, and the bullied girl was brought to Ming Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your humble servant Yue’er thanks Young Miss for her kindness in saving me,” the girl gratefully said as she kowtowed and expressed her thanks through tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Yan could not bear the pitiful sight and immediately helped the girl up. “What’s the matter? Why was that group bullying you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This servant came to Fan City to look for her relatives, but they were long gone when she arrived. This servant was even poisoned mid-journey and lost all of her cultivation. They even wanted to sell this servant to a brothel! If not for Young Miss, then this servant would have been done for.” Yue’er expressed her gratitude and then kneeled down again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From behind Ming Yan, Tang Si suddenly grabbed Yue’er’s arm with a cold look. Ming Yan was angry. “Brother Tang Si, what are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue’er looked at Tang Si in alarm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Si stared at Yue’er and then placed his thumb on her wrist. He palpated her pulse for a moment before releasing her hand. He then respectfully said, “Miss, this girl’s cultivation was not weak, but she was indeed poisoned, and her martial power has dissipated.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She already said that. Look at you, hurting others.” Ming Yan was obviously upset with Tang Si’s actions, and she then turned and looked at Yue’er apologetically. “Yue’er, I’m sorry, but that’s just how he is. He does not realize how forceful he is being sometimes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue’er replied, “Dangers lurk behind every corner. Could Young Miss not blame her brother? He was just trying to protect Young Miss.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Yan nodded and looked at Tang Si. “Can Yue’er’s poison be neutralized?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a deep voice, Tang Si replied, “Yes, but the antidote will need to be verified by the king before she can use it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then let’s go. I’ll look for my father, His Highness,” Ming Yan had no further thoughts of shopping and immediately took Yue’er away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue’er immediately spoke up, “Young Miss, did you just say, ‘His Highness?’ Are you the princess?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Yan stuck out her tongue and smiled. “Yes! I forgot to tell you that. Let’s go and see my father.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue’er was starting to panic, but she was still dragged away by Ming Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Yan was elated. She had heard many storytellers talking about this sort of matter, but she had never thought she would actually be able to personally save a girl from prostitution. This was too fun! The princess grew happier the more she thought about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Si and the rest hurried along behind Ming Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked at Yue’er and felt like cursing.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Damn it! Isn’t she just Yue Xianzi?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;She had slightly altered her appearance, but it wasn’t enough to prevent Lu Yin from recognizing her. This woman had come to Mingdu and directly charged towards the Reverent King's palace, but what were her intentions? She could not possibly think that this silly ploy would be enough to deceive the king.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the facts revealed were beyond Lu Yin’s wildest expectations. Everything that Yue Xianzi had said was proven to be true, and even her relatives who were supposed to provide her with shelter were found to be in Lin City! There were no problems with her story.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was left speechless, and his eyes flickered with a thoughtful light. It appeared that these great powers had settled down in the capital and taken root here long ago, possibly even several hundred years ago, just to make their future trialtakers’ cover stories more believable. Yue Xianzi had the Frostmoon Sect behind her, and they had people who had stepped onto the Shenwu Continent so long ago that they now even had some semblance of a lineage. It was always good for one to have some supporting power behind themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Xianzi’s story caused Ming Yan to express her sympathy. “My father has found your relatives. Do you still want to go to them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Xianzi bitterly shook her head, “They’re only concerned with themselves. It’s no use for me even if I look for them.” She then bowed towards Ming Yan. “Thank you, princess, for your kindness in saving me. Yue’er is unable to return the favor, so my next life will be used to repay your kindness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Yan then looked at Ming Zhaoshu. “Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Zhaoshu looked at Yue Xianzi. “Where did you cultivate your strength?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Xianzi replied, “I was tutored at home by Pingshan Shuiguai.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Zhaoshu was shocked. “The same Pingshan Shuiguai who challenged a Martial Emperor while still at the Martial King realm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where is he now?” His interest was piqued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Xianzi revealed a pained expression. “He died over a year ago and was buried at Pingshan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Zhaoshu nodded and sighed. “What a pity. Your master was a rare breed for him to be able to cross realms. Although he lost that battle, it was still an honorable defeat. His death may be related to that battle back then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, Ming Zhaoshu looked at Yue Xianzi. “You’re Yue’er, right? Are you willing to stay in the Reverent King’s household?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Xianzi was stumped for a moment, but then she looked at Ming Yan. She bowed her head in gratitude. “Yue’er’s willing to use her remaining life to repay her gratitude to the princess.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s great, Yue’er! From now on, you’ll follow me,” Ming Yan was delighted and she looked at Yue Xianzi with gleaming eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Xianzi smiled back at the princess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Zhaoshu watched the two girls leave and then ordered, “Go and investigate Pingshan—not just Pingshan Shuiguai. Include this Yue’er’s family history and search back for a thousand years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is Your Highness afraid that she’s an alien?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Zhaoshu snorted disdainfully. “These aliens have rooted themselves so deeply in the Shenwu Continent that forging a simple identity is no longer difficult for them. I’m still not sure if she’s an alien, so let’s just investigate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If that’s the case, then why is Your Highness allowing her to stay with the princess?” Tang Si could not understand Ming Zhaoshu’s reasoning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Zhaoshu did not reply, and Tang Si left, not daring to speak any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin and the rest set down Ming Yan’s purchases and left as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After they all departed, Yue Xianzi suddenly looked over towards Lu Yin. That person seemed to have intentionally avoided her, and his aura also felt rather familiar. However, she could not recall if she knew this person.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Is he also a trialtaker?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had not altered his appearance too much, so he was afraid that Yue Xianzi might recognize him. He had subtly avoided her, but the woman’s intuition was just too sharp. Lu Yin’s small actions might have escaped the detection of experts, but they could not escape from this woman’s eyes. Although she had not recognized him, she had noticed his irregularity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Island was the central island of the Shenwu Empire as well as the central region of the entire Shenwu Continent. Ming Island was also entirely encircled by a giant river called the Ming River.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Ming River encircles Ming Island and countless tributaries extend from it. After Fan City, it will take us about two days before we reach the Ming River. After we cross that, we’ll be within the boundaries of Ming Island,” Butler Seven explained in a puffed-up manner. He was rather proud that he had visited Ming Island before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter where it was, discrimination would always exist. The people from Ming Island looked down upon those from the other thirty five islands, just like how the people of the Shenwu Empire looked down upon the other regions of the Shenwu Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every island in the Shenwu Empire was massive, and many had never even ventured beyond the boundaries of their island throughout the entire course of their life. Butler Seven was no martial expert, but he had entered Ming Island and was rightfully proud of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin immediately flattered him, causing Butler Seven to become extremely happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, Butler Seven, since the princess is one of the empire’s twin beauties, has no one proposed marriage to her?” Lu Yin asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Butler Seven rolled his eyes. “Of course there have been some, but not many have done so ever since His Highness’s relationship with Crown Prince Ming Hao soured.” Butler Seven then carefully moved closer to Lu Yin’s ear and softly whispered, “Think about it. No matter how pretty the princess is, it won’t matter if you’re dead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you saying that Crown Prince Ming Hao will attack His Highness?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shh! Don’t spout nonsense. I don’t know either,” Butler Seven’s face paled and he stopped speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, Butler Seven was called away by someone, and Lu Yin continued to drive the cart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not much later, a fragrance blew by, and Lu Yin’s expression changed, though he continued to drive the cart. A girl rode up beside him on her horse. It was Yue’er, or rather, Yue Xianzi. “Haven’t we met before?” she inquired as she stared at Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin gave a humble smile. “I’m just a coachman, so how could I have had the honor of meeting miss before?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Xianzi sized him and still felt that he gave a familiar vibe. She was relying on her woman’s intuition, and felt that he was purposefully avoiding her gaze. “Raise your head.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin slowly looked up as he had no choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that point, Butler Seven arrived. “Little Seven, a coachman behind us is sick and can’t move. Go and take his place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A burden lifted from Lu Yin’s heart as he bowed to Yue Xianzi and then immediately left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Miss Yue’er, I hope that Little Seven was not rude to you,” Butler Seven tried to probe into what had just happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Xianzi gave a faint smile. “Of course not. Butler Seven is being too harsh. I just felt that he seemed familiar.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, then I’ll rest assured. After all, Little Seven’s a rural person who doesn’t know the customs of us city folk.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Butler Seven, has Little Seven always been in the Reverent King's household?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He joined us just a few days ago. I accepted him since he seemed to have some skill in taming horses.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Xianzi nodded, smiled at Butler Seven, and then left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Butler Seven took a deep breath, seemingly infatuated. “She’s too fragrant. It’s a pity that she wasn’t sold, or else I would have played with her even if I had to sell everything I own. Such a pity...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Xianzi was very pretty, and many cultivators had become infatuated with her back at Blackwater Lake. Even if she had altered her appearance, she was still a top-tier beauty and was naturally extremely attractive to people like Butler Seven.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Joined just a few days ago?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Yue Xianzi looked at Lu Yin who was eagerly driving a different cart. Her eyes sparkled.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Is he another trialtaker?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;If so, then why did he seem to have no cultivation? Had he hidden it? It would be terrifying if he could truly conceal his cultivation so well. She tried her best to match him to all the experts that she had met, but she ended up drawing a blank. After all, she was the young mistress of Frostmoon Sect and had met far too many young elites. She naturally could not recall all of them.</span></p>
