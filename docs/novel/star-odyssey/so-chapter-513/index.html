He had not had a good time on Planet Pyrolyte this entire time. Before Lu Yin arrived, he had come face to face with death many, many times. After Lu Yin’s arrival, he had been ridiculed by Hai Qiqi so often that he had started questioning life, and he had also been left with no choice but to escape and face dangerous enemies. Finally, ever since Lu Yin had started standing guard over the mountain range, Northgate Gang had turned into a miner. A month had passed since he had last stepped out of the mining tunnel, and it was all because he was afraid of running into Hai Qiqi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His big brother had finally arrived.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Lie looked at Northgate Gang and his bloodshot eyes. As the Explorer looked at his pitiful brother and the mining tools in his hands, he nodded silently. His little brother was finally growing up and starting to work for the sake of the family. He had even started mining on his own accord, despite the difficulties. The saying that adversity forced one to grow up faster was really true. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had guessed that Northgate Lie would come, as <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Kayze</span>’s star essence skin had actually been used for him. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Lu, many thanks.” Northgate Lie spoke respectfully to Lu Yin. Not too long ago, they had been enemies. At that time, Northgate Lie had been fully confident in being able to dominate this Limiteer, but after the battles during the Sea King’s son-in-law selection, he had realized how foolish and overconfident he had been. Lu Yin had long since surpassed him. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin absent mindedly uttered a few pleasantries in reply. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Lie pulled out 2,000 star essence from his cosmic ring. “Brother Lu, I know that this is not enough to pay for this star essence skin, but this is all I have at this time. I owe you a debt, and I’ll pay it off next time, you have my word.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was shocked. “1,000 star essence is fine. Didn’t I say that I would accept just 1000 star essence?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Lie replied solemnly. “This star essence skin is worth much more than 1000 star essence. 3,000 star essence is a more accurate price. Northline Flowzone doesn’t wish to shortchange you, Brother Lu. You saved my brother’s life, and Northline Flowzone owes you a great deal.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since there was someone willing to pay extra, Lu Yin would not stand on ceremony. He accepted the 2,000 star essence and stored them away in his cosmic ring. He had now accumulated 4,000 star essence.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perfect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was excited to discover if the Money Bomb and the universal armor in his possession could fetch such high prices as well. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Lie’s arrival stirred up excitement among many organizations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Outerverse, far out in space, many spacecraft arrived from the Innerverse, carrying huge amounts of star essence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Above Planet Pyrolyte, the many powers were busy working. They weren’t only manufacturing star essence skins, as they also needed to refine pyrolyte ore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Refining pyrolyte ore was harder to accomplish than many had initially anticipated. Since pyrolyte was found in extremely high concentrations as well as explosive and destructive, exceptional care had to be taken while handling it so as not to ignite it. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The level of effort required to refine the ore had been grossly underestimated by the various powers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the present moment, the biggest extractor of pyrolyte ore was the Sword Sect. They had control of Pyrolyte Mountain and had also started mining much earlier than the other great powers. In addition, their robust facilities had already refined around 300 grams of pyrolyte. 300 grams of refined pyrolyte, in terms of destructive power, was the equivalent of an attack with a power level of three million. If it was all ignited at once, it would be strong enough to reduce a planet to a black hole. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The greatest use of pyrolyte was not in battle, as powerhouses could easily divert and lessen the force from a pyrolyte explosion. Pyrolyte was refined for war, as its destructive prowess was something that could strike fear into anyone’s heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Chou Shu’s initial idea had been to take the refined pyrolyte back to the Sword Sect, but he had changed his mind since he was not confident in being able to protect it. He had quickly changed plans to extract all of the pyrolyte here and then request someone more powerful from the sect to come and escort the pyrolyte back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the present moment, Pyrolyte Mountain still had about two thirds of its original pyrolyte ore remaining. After extracting and refining all of the ore, the Sword Sect expected to end up with around 1,000 grams of refined pyrolyte. That, combined with the pyrolyte that the Sword Sect had already gathered from elsewhere in the Astral Wilderness, meant that the Sword Sect would end up with about 1.1 kilograms. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This would become a weapon that the Sword Sect would be able to hold over others. If a large scale war were to break out, this pyrolyte would be enough for the Sword Sect to gain an upper hand in battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a good thing that there was a barrier between the Innerverse and the Neoverse in the form of the Cosmic Sea, as this prevented the Neoverse powers from receiving any timely reports about what was going on. If they had up to date information, then it wouldn’t just be the Innerverse organizations fighting against each other, as those terrifying large behemoths from the Neoverse would be involved as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few days after Northgate Lie descended onto Planet Pyrolyte, a huge beast roared and charged down onto the planet from space, shattering a spacecraft that was taking off along the way. It snatched the pyrolyte from the destroyed ship and then leaped over the mountain range and sped off to the northwest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene shocked many of the gathered powers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that Ze Lin? The individual ranked sixty seventh on the Top 100 Rankings? He’s a powerful expert from the Divine Grade Hall!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, that was Ze Lin, and that was his Oolong Horse. It’s very famous.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Divine Grade Hall must have played a part in this. They’ve always been wealthy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To think that Ze Lin would join the fight on Planet Pyrolyte… Lu Yin’s in big trouble now. Will he be able to fight against the person ranked sixty seventh? It is rumored that Ze Lin’s innate gift allows him to merge with his beasts. He’s a gifted Beast Tamer, and the Divine Grade Hall had to fight against the other powers to recruit him. This man’s abilities cannot be understated.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ze Lin leaped over the top of the mountain range over there.

This man had stepped over his head on purpose. Was he trying to make a point?&nbsp;</span></p>

Ze Lin is extremely powerful. His <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Oolong</span> Horse possesses immense power and is capable of devouring planets. Besides, Ze Lin’s innate gift lets him fuse with his <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Oolong</span> Horse, which makes the horse even stronger. This means that Ze Lin’s weakness as a Beast Tamer, which is their physical defenses, is also minimized. Don’t do anything rash.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin replied without much thought, “He’ll look for me even if I don’t look for him.”</span></p>

The Divine Grade Hall definitely would not let go of this mountain range, so Ze Lin was someone that they would inevitably need to confront.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll go with you,” Northgate Lie solemnly said to Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>

Take care of the mountain range.” And with that, he took to the sky and headed northwest.&nbsp;</span></p>

Lu Yin was curious to find out if this man could force him to reveal his full strength, or perhaps even force him to use his Fatesand. He had many other trump cards with him as well, such as his universal armor, the Money Bomb, and more. While other powers had immense wealth, none of them had his die that could endlessly Enhance his abilities. As such, they had nothing that could assist them with defeating very powerful enemies, while on the other hand, Lu Yin had many such things.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi excitedly followed behind Lu Yin, a wide smile plastered across her face. &nbsp;</span></p>

Before Ze Lin went down to Planet Pyrolyte, <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Karthika</span> had ordered him not to provoke Lu Yin. It was not that <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Karthika</span> was worried about Ze Lin being defeated, but rather that there was simply no need to do so. <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Karthika</span> was planning on letting powerful figures from the other forces deal with Lu Yin, since by now, there were many other powerful individuals on their way. &nbsp;</span></p>

And yet, this rascal had refused to obey and had still chosen the route of provocation.&nbsp;</span></p>

He would never have imagined that Lu Yin would be provoked just from him merely crossing over the mountain range. He had thought that Lu Yin would try to avoid fighting with him at all costs. He would never have expected Lu Yin to have the guts to challenge him, as he was ranked sixty-seventh on the Top 100 Rankings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Alas, there was no longer any meaning to thinking about this.</span></p>

Lu Yin’s face showed that he was dead set on fighting, which made Ze Lin uncomfortable, but he could not reveal his feelings either. He had only recently arrived on Planet Pyrolyte, and so, he did not know about the recent events that had transpired.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Second Grade Hall controlled a pyrolyte mine that was not too far away from the Daynight clan’s mine. They had plundered quite a lot of pyrolyte mines from other organizations, and they had set up their own mining operations not too long ago. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Outside the mining tunnel, Kuang Wang looked up at the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>

This stunned both of them. &nbsp;</span></p>

It was an astral beast that was capable of devouring planets and highly intelligent. And yet, a miserable girl was standing in front of it and daring to say that she wanted to tame it. The beast was livid and wanted to swallow the young girl whole.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ze Lin hurriedly tried to calm his <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Oolong</span> Horse before looking at Lu Yin. “Who the hell are you to challenge me?”&nbsp;</span></p>

However, that was only if Lu Yin partially unsealed his physical strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
