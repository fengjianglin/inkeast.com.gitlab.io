It required even more resources than the one <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Kayze</span> received. He should at least rival the top thirty in the Top 100 Rankings.”</span></p>

His power level may rival the top thirty, but if his opponent is unprepared and he manages to take the initiative, then even that Nightking expert would not be his opponent.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Long and Huo Houye were astonished. “What exactly is his technique?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Dream Sutra,” Scholar Newmoon calmly replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Houye and Lei Long were lost, as they had not heard of such a technique before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Scholar Newmoon did not explain any further, and he merely continued to stare at the screen. He had only seen this technique being mentioned in ancient writings, and even he was not very clear on the details of the technique, but if it was truly that ancient technique, then <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Sleeping Prince</span>’s power definitely was not as simple as it seemed to be. Even if it wasn’t, since that person’s true power could rival the top thirty, then why did he always occupy the hundredth position? Was it truly as was rumored? Did he really like the number hundred that much?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On Planet Pyrolyte, Long Yun saw that Nightking Gu had left, and he took his leave as well since he couldn’t even beat Wendy Yushan by himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stored his gun away and released an exhausted sigh. The most difficult hurdle had just been overcome, and it would take the organizations at least half a month to manufacture another star essence skin. By that time, the pyrolyte ore beneath the mountain range would be almost completely depleted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he looked towards the south, Lu Yin was still afraid that Mira might try to seize this opportunity to act, but it seemed that she had restrained herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He also stored his universal armor away and began returning to the mountain range. Suddenly, he felt tired and beaten. Was this exhaustion? His eyelids drooped, and his body swayed. He almost fell asleep when he suddenly felt that something was amiss, and his scalp tingled. He then saw a huge number of rune lines converging to his left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He turned around and saw <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Sleeping Prince</span>. At this time, <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Sleeping Prince</span>’s eyes had finally opened, and he was lazily looking at Lu Yin. There was a smile in his eyes, but an invisible attack with an indescribable killing intent moved through the void and enveloped Lu Yin. This strange killing intent was very similar to what Lu Yin felt during his lockbreaking attempts, and though Lu Yin wanted to use Secret Sidestep technique to avoid this attack, he was too sleepy. His body could not respond as his mind wished. It was difficult for him to even move slightly, and he really wanted to do nothing more than sleep.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed like the sky had gone dark, and even though Lu Yin could not see where the danger was coming from, he could see a countless number of rune lines approaching him, and the danger that he felt from them was more than enough to destroy him. This was <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Sleeping Prince</span>’s attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, no one was able to save Lu Yin because nobody knew that he would be attacked out of the blue. Lu Yin did not have the strength to resist this attack, and he didn’t even have a chance to don his universal armor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless rune lines approached him. Lu Yin had given up just as they were about to descend upon him, but at that moment, he heard Wendy Yushan’s voice. “Yu Secret Art: Void Transfer.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Off in the distance, the ground was covered by an invisible attack that did not seem destructive, but all of the creatures underground had instantly died.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Still in his same position, Lu Yin had not been harmed at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Sleeping Prince</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">’s expression changed abruptly, and he turned to the west to see Wendy Yushan staring at him with cold eyes. He thought that he had heard an outstanding attack.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Secret Art? Void Transfer? Is that a secret technique?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only was <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Sleeping Prince</span> startled, but in the emptiness of space above the planet, Elder Ren was also shocked as he stared at Wendy Yushan. “That’s a secret technique! That little girl just used a secret technique.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Dashao was astonished. “Secret technique? Why would she have one?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyu was blown away yet again; she had been stunned too many times this day. However, even all of the previous shocks combined did not add up to what she was currently feeling after personally seeing <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Sleeping Prince</span>’s attack be transferred to another place. Only a secret technique could achieve such a feat, and this girl had actually comprehended one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span>, Wen Qichen, Lei Long, Scholar Newmoon, Huo Houye, and the other Enlighters all appeared outside of their spacecraft one after another as they solemnly stared at Wendy Yushan. A secret technique was much more precious than Fatesand, to the point where it was not even on the same level. Fatesand could be obtained through destined opportunities while a secret technique was different.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Each and every secret technique had been created by a Progenitor, so they were all passed down almost singly through a given bloodline. Even so, the majority of them would disappear since these secret techniques were too difficult to cultivate. Even within the Innerverse’s various great powers, only a select few possessed secret techniques, and there was even a possibility that there were no secret techniques at all. After all, not one of the great powers had ever revealed such a thing before. But now, they had all just seen an Outerverse girl wield a secret technique. She was somehow linked to a Progenitor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Each Enlighter’s expression changed, as the appearance of a secret technique made even the pyrolyte pale in comparison. Each of them was contemplating how they could get their hands on this girl.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Myriad Swords Peak had also sent people to Planet Pyrolyte, but they hadn’t sent any Enlighters. At this moment, the top expert from Myriad Swords Peak was actually heading towards the Northcastle Weave in order to use the network to contact the sect. It had just been revealed that their female senior disciple actually possessed a secret technique. This news was too startling, and their sect’s super powerhouse had to be brought over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Myriad Swords Peak expert couldn’t even leave the Astral Wilderness before they were obstructed. The various great powers would not let Wendy Yushan off, so they naturally could not allow the Myriad Swords Peak to intervene.</span></p>

However, that was not enough to block the sword qi, and his arm still ended up being cut. Across from him, the blast of air streaked past Wendy Yushan, and just by passing by her, it caused her to sway and almost fell asleep, as the strength that it carried was too peculiar.&nbsp;</span></p>

Lu Yin, do you think that we can safely escape?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin knew what she meant, as she had become the main focus of all the gathered organizations after revealing the secret technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ll try,” Lu Yin responded seriously. By this point, many powerhouses were focused on them above the planet, and there were at least ten Enlighters here. Escape? They did not know if the Sea King’s forces would help them, but even if they did not, Lu Yin could invite Mister Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you regret it?” Lu Yin could not help himself form asking.</span></p>

However, they rapidly moved closer to Planet Pyrolyte, as they were thinking of methods to grab Wendy Yushan right then and there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Elder Ren appeared, and a terrifying shockwave representing his power level of several hundred thousands rippled out, making the other Enlighters feel frightened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, the Sea King’s Dome has promised to protect Frostwave Weave, and this girl belongs to that place as well. I hope that everyone will show some respect to the Sea King and not touch her,” Elder Ren said as his aged eyes swept across everyone gathered.&nbsp;</span></p>

Before long, all of the Enlighters had moved back without anyone saying anything.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Ren nodded. “That’s true, but it won’t be that easy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the old man finished speaking, a layer of ripples spread out from beneath him. It spread out further and further until the entire region around Planet Pyrolyte had been sealed off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He would not allow the various major forces’ powerhouses to leave, at least not for the time being.</span></p>

They were currently racking their brains for a way to leave and report to their respective powers, as Wendy Yushan’s value now surpassed the value of all of the pyrolyte ore on the planet. Elder Ren could stop them for now, but he would no longer be able to once the pyrolyte ore had been completely harvested. At that time, he would no longer be able to obstruct them. As for whether or not they could get a hold of Wendy Yushan, that all depended on the baseline strength of the various powers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan had displayed a secret technique, and Lu Yin had shown that he had the strength to severely injure Nightking Gu as well as repel Long Yun. When the two youths worked together, as long as Avery was held back by Hai Dashao, the curtains would close on the contest for pyrolyte ore on this planet. No one would be able to seize control of the mountain range from those two.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many smaller powers had finished their activities on Planet Pyrolyte a long time ago. They wanted to leave, but all of them were restrained by Elder Ren.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a full month went by, the last of the pyrolyte ore beneath the mountain range was finally mined out, and the leaders of the various organizations relaxed and looked at Elder Ren.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Ren had already told them in no uncertain terms that all of them would have to wait for Northline Flowzone to finish mining the pyrolyte ore, and that only then would he remove the seal around Planet Pyrolyte. At that moment, Lu Yin, Wendy Yushan, and Hai Qiqi would be the first to leave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was all being done to protect Lu Yin and the others. It would prevent them from being ambushed by a powerhouse along their journey, but it would only work for a short while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s face turned solemn when he looked at his cosmic ring. He surveyed the region, but he knew that not even the Sea King himself would be able to protect Wendy Yushan. Lu Yin could only invite Mister Mu to help. Though he couldn’t do that here; it would have to wait until they were back on Zenyu Star. That would allow Mister Mu to become a legend on Zenyu Star, which would make the other great powers a bit apprehensive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most important thing to do right now was to return to Zenyu Star.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all of the pyrolyte ore was mined out, the star essence skins became useless. Also, the various powerhouses were finally able to make a move against Planet Pyrolyte. They eliminated the atmosphere of the planet and exposed the entire planet to the vacuum of space, completely changing the environment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The collapse of Planet Pyrolyte then began.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin retrieved his collapsible spacecraft, which just so happened to be able to hold three people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beneath him, the ground began to rupture. The Limiteers who had been fighting against each other on Planet Pyrolyte all either moved to return to their spacecraft or donned a universal armor. They were no longer protected by the atmosphere of Planet Pyrolyte, so their entire bodies were essentially about to be exposed to the emptiness of outer space.</span></p>
