 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why?” The fatty was aware of his own strength, so he wasn’t offended, but he was still vigilant towards Mr. Bai.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai shrugged and reluctantly answered, “Do you believe that you will be able to obtain something once you enter the house? Some things cannot be gained alone, and have you not realized that most people here walk around in groups? You have a reduced chance of obtaining something if you remain alone.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang San hesitated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you do not believe me, then you can take your leave, and I can search for someone else,” Mr. Bai said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin didn’t even hesitate to immediately walk forward. He wasn’t scared of Mr. Bai, and if this person dared to deceive him, then Lu Yin would simply make him understand the consequences of his actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty quickly followed as soon as he saw that Lu Yin had made a decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai smiled and walked into the house.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right when the three of them entered the house, Mr. Bai suddenly attacked. However, a small, pale hand appeared from just outside the house and countered his attack. The shockwave forced the fatty forwards, and he looked back in shock.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait a second! Don’t attack!” A clear voice rang out from outside the house, and a cute girl suddenly moved in front of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Miss, it is not very polite to follow people,” Mr. Bai said with a smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin wasn’t surprised, as he had noticed that this girl had been following them ever since they had entered the city, and she was also quite powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl pouted, but she still apologized, “I’m sorry. I unintentionally came to this city and saw the three of you, so I thought that I would come over and take a look.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai asked, “Was that attack just now something from the Progenitor of Combat Territory?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl nodded. “I’m from the Sage Martial Realm. You can call me Miss Qing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Sage Martial Realm!” the fatty exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai was shocked as well. “The Progenitor of Combat Territory consists of the Sage Martial Realm, the Grand Martial Realm, and the War Martial Realm. The Immortal Martial Realm is the homeland of the Progenitor of Combat and has produced many geniuses. I did not expect you to be someone from the Sage Martial Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Miss Qing laughed. “Every place has both strong and weak people, and I’m just an average person. From your attack just now, I can already tell that you are very powerful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai smiled. “You are too humble. It must be fate that brought us together, so shall we explore this city together as well?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Miss Qing nodded happily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai pointed at the fatty and said, “Let me introduce you to Huang San from the Bloodburn Realm’s Huang family.” He then pointed to Lu Yin. “This brother is also exploring with us, but he is both deaf and mute, so we cannot really communicate with him. However, he is very powerful.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Miss Qing nodded at the fatty but then glanced at Lu Yin in surprise. “Deaf and mute? There are deaf and mute cultivators here?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai answered, “Nothing is impossible, as there are some who were born with such a condition whereas others have chosen to seal their senses.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have heard about that before. One of the Daosource Three Skies, Wu Taibai, supposedly chose to seal off his senses,” Miss Qing mentioned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai replied, “Wu Taibai is out of our league, so we should not discuss him. He might even have been born with those defects.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Miss Qing nodded and stopped probing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin calmly listened to their conversation. They didn’t know that he truly had sealed himself, though it just wasn’t his senses. Instead, he had sealed off his physical strength. Back when he had still been a Limiteer, his physical strength had been overly powerful, and he hadn’t been able to control it. Thus, he had used Fatesand to seal it away. However, now that he had become an Explorer, he could control that same degree of strength quite easily, and thus, he didn’t need to seal his physical strength any longer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite that, having his strength sealed by Fatesand was very beneficial to Lu Yin since it allowed him to continuously improve his physical strength, which was why he had not yet removed the seal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back in that strange isolated space with the golden sea, he had met the war spirit of someone who had sealed his senses off. Lu Yin would never forget that war spirit with sealed eyes, or the crushing feeling of the spirit’s domain as soon as those eyes had opened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most people who chose to seal themselves were extremely powerful. From the current conversation, Lu Yin quickly understood that Wu Taibai was one of the Daosource Three Skies and had somehow sealed himself. Were the Daosource Three Skies some sort of title?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai took the lead with Lu Yin and the other two following him as they all &nbsp;approached the house.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Miss Qing looked at Lu Yin curiously while fatty stared at her in turn. The Immortal Martial Realm was a special place. Although it was also under the Progenitor of Combat like the Grand Martial Realm and the War Martial Realm, the Sage Martial Realm had produced an impressive number of powerhouses. Many of the Grand Martial Realm and the War Martial Realm’s top experts had tried and failed to join the Sage Martial Realm. It was very rare to meet an expert from the Sage Martial Realm in the outside world, as most of them remained within their own realm. He didn’t expect to meet someone from the Sage Martial Realm while exploring the Daosource Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The house wasn’t very large, and they soon encountered a formless danger after taking just a few steps.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Retreat. It’s a formless danger from a sourcebox, which means that there is a sourcebox inside this house,” Mr. Bai cautioned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They took a few steps back as the formless danger was activated with a loud bang. It caused most of the items inside the house to shatter, and a few transparent spheres and an oddly shaped stone also fell out. This stone was a sourcebox while the transparent spheres contained traces of blood. There were faint roaring sounds coming from the spheres.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty grew excited. “Those are bloodlines!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai smiled. “So there truly are some bloodlines here, but they are protected by that sourcebox’s formless danger. Let me make an attempt.” He walked forward to evaluate the formless danger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin watched Mr. Bai intently as he easily evaded the formless danger and continuously approached the transparent spheres and sourcebox. Suddenly, space was torn apart, and Mr. Bai’s silhouette blurred. He hurriedly retreated and sighed. “The formless danger is very powerful, and it seems that the energy barrier that we broke through outside was not something left behind from the ancient war. Rather, it should have been created by this sourcebox. We will have to unlock it. Otherwise, we will not be able to obtain those bloodlines.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang San anxiously asked, “Mr. Bai, can you successfully unlock it?” The people from the Progenitor of Combat Territory didn’t use bloodlines, but the fatty was someone from the Progenitor of Bloodlines Territory, and bloodlines were the easiest way for him to improve his strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai considered it for a moment. “I should be able to, but it will take me a very long time. I will not be able to finish unlocking it before my futon’s time is up, so I will need someone to help me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can help. I want to know what bloodlines those are. If there are any invincible bloodlines among them, then they’ll be very valuable,” Miss Qing volunteered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai smiled. “There seems to be a high chance, as common items would not have been stored in the Daosource Sect.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty was getting anxious, as he didn’t have any talent for lockbreaking. Thus, if the two of them were successful, then he wouldn’t have any right to those bloodlines. He looked at Lu Yin in desperation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stepped forward. He wasn’t trying to help the fatty, as he also wanted to get his own hands on the bloodlines. He wanted to take them home with him so that he could study them. He agreed with what Mr. Bai had said—any bloodline that could be found in the Daosource Sect had to be special, and he didn’t want to waste his trip here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai and Miss Qing weren’t surprised to discover that Lu Yin was a Lockbreaker, as such a thing wasn’t enough to surprise them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them started lockbreaking. Mr. Bai was the fastest, and Miss Qing’s technique was both elegant and gentle. Lu Yin worked very cautiously since he neither had any lockbreaking tools with him, nor was he able to see any rune lines in this place. As such, he was forced to rely solely on his domain and Cosmic Art to lockbreak. Furthermore, he didn’t have a great deal of lockbreaking experience, so he clearly couldn’t compare to the other two.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He also didn’t want to reveal the full strength of his domain to these people, though that prevented him from more clearly perceiving the sourcebox and its formless danger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every sourcebox was different, which meant that there was no fixed lockbreaking method. The formless danger within the house wasn’t very dangerous to the four youths, but it could easily destroy the bloodlines, which was why all three of them had started lockbreaking simultaneously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite their teamwork, they couldn’t predict what reactions the sourcebox’s formless danger would take once they started lockbreaking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A transparent sphere cracked apart, and the bloodline that had been stored within it evaporated quickly, disappearing within a handful of seconds. They could vaguely hear a deafening roar as the blood evaporated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They lamented the loss, but there really was nothing that they could have done about it as their current abilities weren’t enough to perfectly control the formless danger. However, the three of them didn’t have any strong desires for the bloodlines, and they all cared more about the sourcebox.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty’s heart was dripping blood. Nobody else could understand the meaning that a bloodline held for the cultivators of the Progenitor of Bloodlines Territory; it was basically their life!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lockbreaking was a lengthy process, but it only took the three of them half a day since they were working purely to neutralize the formless danger. The irregularly shaped stone was enveloped by a complex layer of energy, and Mr. Bai estimated that they would need two more days to finish unlocking the sourcebox itself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty fervently stared at the three remaining spheres. They contained three bloodlines within them, and now that the formless danger from the sourcebox was gone, he could take them at any time. Despite that, he didn’t dare to take anything and didn’t even try. There were three spheres, and they would clearly be evenly distributed among the three lockbreakers, which caused the fatty to worry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A day later, the energy layers above the stone had thinned noticeably as the three youths continued lockbreaking from three different directions, slowly dissipating the complex energies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another day later, the energy layers had become incredibly thin. Lu Yin and Miss Qing finally paused and just watched on as Mr. Bai continued lockbreaking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai carefully dissolved the energy when a ray of light suddenly appeared, illuminating the youths’ faces. An ear shattering cry was heard, followed by burning flames.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai quickly pulled back, and the others retreated as well. The flames licked at the structure of the house and even the three transparent spheres started to crack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The flames then disappeared as quickly as it had come. They sputtered out after reducing the house to nothing but ashes, and the four people could see that the sourcebox had vanished completely.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was sad that there had been nothing inside the sourcebox.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh no, the bloodlines are gone!” the fatty shouted as he regretfully looked at the cracked spheres.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai pushed the fatty towards the spheres. “You are the only one among us who is from the Progenitor of Bloodlines Territory, so you should go and absorb a bloodline. Otherwise, they will all be wasted.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty was ecstatic. “Can I?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hurry up. Don’t waste any time!” Miss Qing urged him forward as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang San barrelled over towards the three spheres. His gaze swept across the three bloodlines that were just five seconds away from fully evaporating. He quickly chose the one on the right and bit his index finger to draw blood. He then pressed his wounded finger up against the bloodline with great excitement, and it almost instantly melted into the fatty’s body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty’s expression changed, and he looked up at the sky as he released a deafening sound: the squeal of a pig.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What an aggressive squeal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai and Miss Qing were clearly dazed as well, and they looked at the fatty in confusion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang San’s entire body turned red as the bloodline continued traveling around his body until it completely integrated with it. Once it disappeared, the fatty let out another squeal. However, this second squeal made Mr. Bai and the rest tremble, and even the sky shook slightly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Skygobbling Pig bloodline.” Mr. Bai grew serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Miss Qing looked at fatty with clear envy. “He’s so lucky to have gotten an invincible bloodline. The other spheres probably contained invincible bloodlines too. It’s a shame that he actually picked the one with the Skygobbling Pig bloodline.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was confused by her words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai laughed. “Fatty is a very lucky person. He originally had the Pompom Pig bloodline, and thus, the Skygobbling Pig bloodline will be greatly beneficial to him.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Miss Qing was stunned. “What? This fatty had the Pompom Pig bloodline?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai nodded.</span></p>
