 <p dir="ltr"><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Karthika</span> <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">spun around. He had no interest in what Huo Qingshan had to say since it was what he had expected. This was, of course, under the presumption that no one with an even stronger background than <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Karthika</span>’s was willing to stand up for Lu Yin. Otherwise, things would definitely stay under his control. For now, he was more interested in the person in front of him. “For cultivators from the Outerverse, reaching the level of Hunter is no easy feat. I can recommend you for a position in the Second Grade Hall. Are you interested?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Qingshan politely declined the offer, “My apologies, but I do not have any wish to leave my homeland.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Karthika</span> <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">was unsatisfied with such an answer. “While trapped in an insignificant place like Frostwave Weave, it was nothing more than a stroke of luck for you to cultivate to the level of Hunter.” Once he was done speaking, he stepped forward and completely vanished. He could actually leave now if he wished since Zenyu Star was not going anywhere. Lu Yin would not dare to renege on his agreement, since the price he would have to pay for doing so would be more than what he could bear. However, <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Karthika</span> also wanted to stay around to check out Lu Yin. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There had been many unparalleled individuals in his generation as well, and those individuals who were unsurpassed within their respective realms had left a rather deep impression on him. Lu Yin was similarly unsurpassed within his own realm, which was why <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Karthika</span> wanted to meet him and see if there were any similarities between Lu Yin and&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">that&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">person from his generation. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was also another issue to be addressed. The commotion at Planet Pyrolyte would only grow more intense as time went on. Since he had the option to stay in the background, he would naturally choose to not come out on his own. Instead, he would let Nightqueen Qiuyu do all the dirty work. The Daynight clan was known for being tyrannical, and the more enemies the clan made, the more relaxed others would feel, and it was the same even for <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Karthika</span>. At this moment in time, the Daynight clan indeed seemed to be the Second Grade Hall’s best partner, but who knew what the future held.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zenyu Star had a beautiful scenery.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Astral Wilderness, there was a huge battleship blazing with flames. It was not being destroyed, rather was on fire of its own accord. This was a spacecraft from the Blaze Realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Blaze Realm’s battleship, there was a figure silently looking down at Planet Pyrolyte. The surroundings’ high temperatures were enough to even distort the void. This figure seemed to be blazing like a star, but strangely enough, he did not damage any of the objects around him. This man was Master Huo Houye, a powerful Enlighter from the Blaze Realm. He was an almighty cultivator with a power level of 240,000. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not too far away from where Huo Houye was standing, the void distorted as a strong but ugly looking man stepped out. He faced Huo Houye and spoke with a dull voice. “I am Lei Long of the Dire Barbarian Clan.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Houye turned around and stared at the middle-aged man, focusing on the man’s face. His eyes flickered; those from the Dire Barbarian Clan all had peculiar appearances, and ugly was not quite enough to describe their appearances. Sinister was a better word. These people were the complete opposite of those from the Souldream Tribe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Souldream Tribe were known for producing beautiful women, whereas it would be a stretch to find even a decent looking person within the Dire Barbarian Clan. Perhaps this was why the Souldream Tribe and Dire Barbarian Clan had been enemies for so long. The Dire Barbarian Clan wanted to make use of the Souldream Tribe to improve their future generations’ genes and allow their descendants to be more attractive. However, the Souldream Tribe carried a natural hatred for the Dire Barbarian Clan, as they especially loathed the way they handled things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regardless, at this time, it was easy to recognize someone from the Dire Barbarian Clan just by their appearance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those of the Dire Barbarian Clan had become used to this, which was why Lei Long did not mind Master Huo Houye scrutinizing his appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Lei, what is the purpose of this visit?” Huo Houye asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Long solemnly replied, “To form an alliance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Houye pondered over this information.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Long continued, saying, “Recently, many powers have formed alliances, so pillaging pyrolyte ore using just one’s own strength is now impossible. As far as I am aware, even the Second Grade Hall has now formed an alliance with the Daynight clan. Brother Huo, you should be well aware that the strongest power on Planet Pyrolyte is currently the Second Grade Hall.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Houye looked at Lei Long. “We are open to entering an alliance, but how would we split the pyrolyte ore?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This goes without saying. We would each take half,” Lei Long replied.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Houye broke out in laughter. “Brother Lei, you must be dreaming! In terms of distance, my Blaze Realm is the closest to this place, so I can deploy skilled warriors at any moment. On the other hand, your Dire Barbarian Clan is located very far away. Besides, you don’t even have any powerful Limiteers who would be of any use on the planet’s surface. Brother Lei, do you really believe that you deserve half a share?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Long knitted his brows. “What you said is not entirely accurate as we have many Limiteer cultivators within the Dire Barbarian Clan. Also, there are many powers researching a way to let Explorers enter Planet Pyrolyte. The Dire Barbarian Clan has Explorers who are worthy of stepping on to the Top 100 Rankings as well.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Houye was not bothered about such claims; the Blaze Realm had everything the Dire Barbarian Clan possessed. Everyone had their own hidden trump cards, but there was a singular someone in the Dire Barbarian Clan whom he actually paid attention to: Avery. Avery was a powerful individual who was ranked fourth within the Top 100 Rankings. If Cruisers were allowed to enter Planet Pyrolyte, then that man would be of great use. It would be as good as having a decisive player on their team. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, dividing the pyrolyte ore equally on the grounds of an unknown possibility was too big of a risk to take, and it was also a risk that Master Huo Houye was unwilling to take. However, he did not immediately reject the proposal. “I’ll tell you what, Brother Lei. Why won’t we decide how to split the pyrolyte ore after we get ahold of it. Is that alright with you?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Long squinted his eyes and pondered for a moment before agreeing. Even though the Blaze Realm was strong, his Dire Barbarian Clan was not lacking in any way. If the Blaze Realm dared to go back on its word, then Lei Long felt certain that he would be able to make them pay dearly for such transgressions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The premise for forming an alliance was that both parties had similar levels of strength. Those in the Eight Great Flowzones would only seek out alliances from others within the Eight Great Flowzones. As for the smaller flowzones, such as Northline Flowzone, they could only seek out the smaller flowzones for assistance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northline Flowzone was really down on its luck. Northgate Gang, Ah Fan, and the others had been matched against Jared from the Blaze Realm. Just one battle alone was enough to leave Northline Flowzone with heavy casualties and ten people dead. To add insult to injury, even the pyrolyte ore that Northline Flowzone’s team had extracted was snatched away. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Planet Pyrolyte was huge, everyone had a pyrolyte ore detector, so there was a high chance of finding it. In short, the team from Northline Flowzone was simply unlucky to have run into powerful experts from the Eight Great Flowzones. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, on Planet Pyrolyte, less than a third of the cultivators were from the Eight Great Flowzones, and the majority of the others were Limiteers from the smaller flowzones. Alas, numbers did not mean everything; in the end, the only ones who could act brazenly and steal pyrolyte were those from the Eight Great Flowzones. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bitter defeat of Northgate Gang and the others caused those from Northline Flowzone to become extremely anxious. Lily Anne wanted to contact Lu Yin several times, and Granny Chan was even willing to add more onto their offer. However, any action on Lu Yin’s part would put the Great Yu Empire at great risk, and Lily Anne felt that there was nothing she could do to move Lu Yin unless Granny Chan promised to oversee and protect the Great Yu Empire. That was one of the few things that could ensure the safety of the Great Yu Empire. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, that was an impossible condition. Granny Chan’s departure would mean a loss of prestige for the Lily Clan. Granny Chan was more important to the clan than pyrolyte.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another three days passed. When Lu Yin looked at the projected route, the calculated arrival time was in another ten days.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On this day, there was a violent change above Planet Pyrolyte; the Limiteer cultivators from the Sword Sect had arrived.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The various powers were all stunned by their arrival, and the newcomers all headed to a personal spacecraft before descending into Planet Pyrolyte’s atmosphere. Everyone sensed that the power structure of Planet Pyrolyte was about to shift. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most worried parties were definitely the Second Grade Hall and the Daynight clan. Currently, Planet Pyrolyte was almost entirely controlled by the Second Grade Hall and the Daynight clan. They had more than a hundred Limiteer cultivators guarding Planet Pyrolyte, and most of them were from the Second Grade Hall while a minority were from the Daynight clan. The striking features of the black and white hair was impossible to miss, and it also provided a good reminder for the other powers that the two had formed an alliance. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The minute the Sword Sect’s spacecraft rushed over to Planet Pyrolyte, Nightqueen Qiuyu’s brows bunched up. She stepped forward, tearing through the void even faster than the Sword Sect’s battleship. It was a spacecraft shaped like a sword, and it looked rather strange. It did however, have an extremely sharp tip that caused the void around it to become unstable. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Liu Sanjian, come out!” Nightqueen Qiuyu yelled. As far as her eyes could see, all of the Sword Sect’s disciples had been overwhelmed with shock by her cry, and they didn’t even dare to raise their heads. A curtain of rain sprinkled down from the sky, creating an amazing sight. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A middle aged man stepped out from the sword-shaped battleship with a resolute look on his face. As he towered high in the sky, he directly faced Nightqueen Qiuyu. This man was Liu Sanjian. It was rumored that, from the moment he began cultivating, he had only ever used three strikes in all his battles, regardless of the final result. He was a powerful Hunter who boasted a power level of 190,000.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Qiuyu, is something the matter?” Liu Sanjian asked in a calm manner as he looked at Nightqueen Qiuyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyu pointed towards Planet Pyrolyte and icily replied, “The Sword Sect has entered Planet Pyrolyte in the direction of Pyrolyte Mountain. What is the meaning of this? The universe is so vast, and yet you chose this place to land. Are you trying to challenge the Daynight clan?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Sanjian indifferently replied, “Planet Pyrolyte has not been claimed by anyone, and neither has Pyrolyte Mountain. It does not belong to the Daynight clan, and so, it is open for all to contest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyu’s gaze turned icy. “Planet Pyrolyte is vast, and Pyrolyte Mountain is not the only place where pyrolyte ore can be mined. Go find another place. I can guarantee you that the Daynight clan will not bother you in any fashion.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I cannot do that.” Liu Sanjian’s words were curt. He held absolutely no regard for the Nightqueen, even though he was merely a Hunter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his younger days, he had been the cream of the crop in the Sword Sect and feared no one. It seemed like his former courage was still present at this time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyu’s anger soon condensed into a dry, sarcastic laughter. “Very well then, a worthless individual dares to challenge me. It seems like my years spent hiding on Nightking Planet has caused the outside world to forget about the might of Nightqueen Qiuyu! I will force all of you to remember my power today!” As soon as she finished speaking, she prepared to strike. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Sanjian’s gaze became increasingly piercing as he grabbed the hilt of his sword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, the space between the two distorted, and a figure stepped out. Sighing deeply, the figure said, “Qiuyu, you are still as tyrannical as ever.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she heard this voice, Nightqueen Qiuyu’s body shook. She stared in astonishment at the old person in front of her, and her voice quivered. “Vile- big brother <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span>?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Sanjian looked at the old man and bowed respectfully. “Elder <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span>.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This old man’s name was Elder <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span>, and he was an elder from the Sword Sect. He was also the person in charge of the Sword Sect’s pyrolyte gathering expedition. He was an Enlighter with a power level of 270,000.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Brother Chou, I never expected that the Sword Sect would send you here,” Nightqueen Qiuyu commented, bewildered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Elder Viletree <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">looked at Nightqueen Qiuyu and musingly replied, “It has been a thousand years since we last met, and now, we’re both old. It is about time for us to keep our tempers in check.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rain in the sky was now pouring down even heavier than before, and Nightqueen Qiuyu turned to face Planet Pyrolyte. “This is the first time in a thousand years I have come out on a mission, so I do not wish to fail.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">revealed a bitter smile. “It was this terrible temper of yours that made him leave back then. Do you still not see that?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyu’s gaze abruptly snapped back to <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span>. “My temper? How laughable! It was the clan’s rules that drove that coward away. I was willing to turn my back on the clan to leave with him, but he still ran away. Big brother Chou, can I really be blamed for that?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Elder <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">sighed deeply. “It happened such a long time ago, but you are still unable to accept it. Forget it, let’s not bring up the past.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyu’s emotions became increasingly unstable, causing the rainfall’s intensity to fluctuate as a moment of silence passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Sanjian took advantage of the pause to leave.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyu’s body trembled once more as she turned around to leave. “Big brother <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span>, our personal relationships aside, this battle on Planet Pyrolyte is something where I will show absolutely no mercy.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he looked at the empty sky, <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span> sighed once more. He never would have dreamed that he would meet this old friend of his in such a place. Besides, this was an old friend whom he both wished to see and wished to avoid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom boom boom!</span></p>

These sounds were of a large spacecraft landing directly atop Pyrolyte Mountain. The newcomers had obviously come here to take control of Pyrolyte Mountain. For a faction to make such a brazen landing at this time meant that it was highly likely for the vessels to belong to the Sword Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
