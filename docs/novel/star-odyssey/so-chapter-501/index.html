 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-fdab89f1-7fff-05ab-5f4b-6cb3fb70b33a"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was the most concerned about the major powers like the Daynight clan and the Sword Sect. They each had countless Explorers who were extremely powerful in their own right, and once this group of people arrived on Planet Pyrolyte, he would have to be cautious of them as well. Besides, a high enough quantity of Explorers might be enough to close the gap in the power difference, as even Ling Que had been nearly defeated by the Daynight clan’s joint attack. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did anyone mention how much progress has been made on sending Explorers to Planet Pyrolyte?” Lu Yin asked. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Gang solemnly replied, “No, but with Northline Flowzone’s current research speed, it’s almost impossible for us to accomplish such a thing. However, I’m not sure about what methods the other major forces might be employing, especially for technologically advanced organizations such as the Ross Empire. They might be able to come up with some creative methods.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin raised his head. Even if the major forces were able to force Explorers to lower their cultivation and return to the Limiteer realm, he still wasn’t worried since such people wouldn’t be able to do anything against him. He was invincible within this realm, and he doubted that the major powers would sacrifice their elite Explorers on the Top 100 Rankings just to participate in this contest for pyrolyte.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, if Explorers were able to descend onto Planet Pyrolyte in their normal condition, that would be an entirely different situation. Elites from the Top 100 Rankings would then start to appear, and that would completely change the battlefield. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It looked like Lu Yin needed to hurry up to find Zhanlong Daynight if he wanted to ask him what had happened on Shenwu Continent. Once that was settled, Lu Yin planned to immediately leave since he had no interest in fighting over pyrolyte ore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Above the planet, the various powers suddenly realized a strange coincidence: Pyrolyte Mountain, Pyrolyte Lake, and the recently discovered Pyrolyte Plain actually formed a perfect equilateral triangle. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This discovery surprised everyone, but they didn’t bother thinking about the matter any further since they all assumed that it was just a coincidence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Ross Empire’s spacecraft, dozens of researchers excitedly looked at a screen. They were geologists from the empire. After they had come to Planet Pyrolyte, they had spent all of their time scanning the planet, trying to simulate the atmosphere on the surface of Planet Pyrolyte in order to determine where the majority of the pyrolyte ore lay. After continuously plugging in an enormous amount of data, they were finally about to obtain some results. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Multiple images of the pyrolyte ore’s distribution appeared on the screen, and they changed as the simulation transitioned from ten thousand years ago, to a thousand years ago, to the current time. Finally, on the screen, only one bright spot remained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone stared at the screen with bated breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bright spot was superimposed on the current map of Planet Pyrolyte, and a location was marked out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How can it be there?” someone exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone attentively studied the map, as the location that it predicted to hold the greatest reserve of pyrolyte ore was in a mountain range that was surrounded by Pyrolyte Mountain, Pyrolyte Lake, and Pyrolyte Plain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The screen shifted again, and a map clearly showing the distribution of pyrolyte ore appeared. The most interesting thing on this image was an inverted triangular pyramid formed by Pyrolyte Mountain, Pyrolyte Lake and Pyrolyte Plain that showed a detailed image of vast amounts of pyrolyte ore buried deep underground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, Pyrolyte Mountain, Pyrolyte Lake and Pyrolyte Plain were all formed on the surface when that core vein of pyrolyte ore shifted about. However, the true location of the pyrolyte ore is still under that mountain range, where it has remained this whole time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s no wonder why we couldn't find it. That location is very close to the core of the planet, and most detectors wouldn’t be able to sense it at all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ve finally found the location of the primary vein of pyrolyte ore! We have to keep this to ourselves. Nobody can reveal this information!” someone ordered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, there was a beeping sound from a corner. A man with a pale face removed his gadget as blood dripped down from the corner of his mouth. He had committed suicide, and the people around him anxiously retrieved his gadget. “It’s too late! Details of this information have already been sent out! Who brought this person in?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An elder suddenly appeared. “No one is allowed to leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After those terse words, he left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in the room was stunned. They had all recognized the elder; he was Scholar Newmoon, an extremely knowledgeable elder who was well known within the Ross Empire. He was also one of the Ross Empire’s few Enlighters. Most of the people in the room hadn’t even known that he had come to Planet Pyrolyte.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most important thing at this moment was for the Ross Empire to act fast. The details of the information that they had gained had already been leaked, so there was absolutely no possibility of them monopolizing the large vein of pyrolyte ore that they had just discovered. Since that was already given, Scholar Newmoon made the decision to appear within the Blaze Realm’s spacecraft after sending down a huge batch of Limiteers to the planet. At the same time, he also sent a message to Lei Long of the Dire Barbarian Clan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The biggest problem before them was that they had no idea who the information had been sent to. It wouldn’t be a big issue if the recipient was a minor flowzone, but the probability of that being the case was extremely low. The most probable answer was that the information had been received by one of the Eight Great Flowzones, and Scholar Newmoon could only hope that it hadn’t been the Sword Sect or the Daynight clan. If it was either of those two, then they wouldn’t be able to even fight for the ore.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On Planet Pyrolyte, Lu Yin was just about to leave with Hai Qiqi when hundreds of spacecraft appeared in the sky, all of them heading towards the mountain range.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Gang and the others were astonished. Why were there suddenly so many people who wanted to fight for this mountain range?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin couldn’t leave now, as Northgate Gang and the others definitely wouldn’t be able to defend the mountain range without him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang bang bang…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fleet of spacecraft landed across the mountain range, and some of the vessels even landed near Northgate Gang and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Gang and the other cultivators immediately attacked the people in the ships, and the sounds of exploding vessels rang out along the mountain range. Countless Limiteers exited the spacecraft and started fighting back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beams of light pierced through the ground, showing that some of the attackers carried technological weapons with them.</span></p>

Out of all of the various powers, only the Ross Empire was able to create such androids.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It appeared that the Ross Empire was determined to gain control of the mountain range.</span></p>

However, the Ross Empire was recklessly using such weapons, which thoroughly confused the other organizations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ross Empire gave a very simple reason: a noble’s son had been killing at this mountain range, and they wanted revenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the other forces weren’t entirely convinced, they didn’t pay much attention to the matter as there was very little pyrolyte in the mountain range’s vicinity, so there wasn’t much value in fighting for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the Blaze Realm’s spacecraft, Scholar Newmoon, Huo Houye, and Lei Long of the Dire Barbarian Clan closely watched the screen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t even know who sent that person! What if he was from the Sword Sect or one of the other major powers? If that ends up being the case, then we won’t be able to take control of the mountain range even if we all join forces together,” &nbsp;Huo Houye spoke seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Scholar Newmoon helplessly answered, “We’re already investigating his background. Who would have thought that someone would infiltrate the geology department.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no point in dwelling on this. Newmoon, you’re a scholar. How can we still keep this matter a secret if you’ve already launched such a massive attack?” Lei Long asked unhappily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Newmoon</span> <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">sighed, replying, “The secret has already been leaked, so there’s no point in complaining anymore. The highest priority we have at this moment is to gain control of this mountain range, or to join forces with the strongest outside force.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Houye’s eyes gleamed. “The strongest outside force? What do you mean by that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“An unparalleled Limiteer can be the strongest outside force,” <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Newmoon</span> stated confidently.</span></p>

There were four unparalleled Limiteers, and the strongest one wasn’t at Planet Pyrolyte. Thus, <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Newmoon</span> was clearly referring to Mu Rong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You want to join forces with the Sword Sect?” Lei Long asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Newmoon</span> <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">shook his head, “Not me alone. Rather, all three of us will join forces with the Sword Sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Houye narrowed his eyes; <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Newmoon</span> was truly a scheming person. If the Ross Empire had joined forces with the Sword Sect by themselves, then they would have definitely suffered a huge loss when dividing the profits. However, if their three organizations joined together, then the situation would be different. No matter how overbearing the Sword Sect was, it couldn’t defeat all three of them once they joined forces. That was the true reason why the old man had first come looking for the two of them instead of going straight to the Sword Sect. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, Scholar Newmoon was even more worried about being killed by the Sword Sect. That was the primary motivation for him to join forces with the other two Enlighters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although the information has been leaked, it probably won’t be revealed too quickly. We need to take control of that mountain range immediately so that we can use our detailed information as well as the mountain range to join forces with the Sword Sect. This will help ensure that we can obtain the greatest profits,” <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Newmoon</span> slowly explained.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Houye and Lei Long didn’t object as this was truly the only feasible solution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they had initially expected to take control of the mountain range with the hundreds of androids that the Ross Empire had sent out, half a day later, the three Enlighters were surprised by the outcome. The androids had been soundly defeated by a single girl.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the mountain range on Planet Pyrolyte, Hai Qiqi had used her forcefield to envelop the entire mountain range. The androids had then been defeated one by one, all of them collapsing to the ground while emitting smoke. She didn’t destroy any of the androids, but she did ensure that none of them would be able to attack anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Gang stared at her in awe. He hadn’t expected Hai Qiqi to be so powerful, and the power of her forcefield was particularly surprising to everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin wasn’t shocked since he had already known that Hai Qiqi’s domain was much stronger than his and that she might have even comprehended a forcefield. She was definitely one of the top three strongest people on Planet Pyrolyte, as she only seemed to be weaker than Mu Rong. Defeating the androids from the Ross Empire had been an easy task for her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi was delighted. She had held herself back from fighting for quite a few days, so even though the androids were rather useless, they had still managed to satisfy her craving for battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How was it? I’m powerful right?” Hai Qiqi proudly asked Northgate Gang, and she even sneaked a glance at Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Gang immediately started praising her, but even after that, he was still bombarded by Hai Qiqi’s ruthless sarcasm. Her words were truly as powerful as her forcefield.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle at the mountain range didn’t attract too much attention. Although the Ross Empire was acting strangely, most forces focused on their own cultivators.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Scholar Newmoon and the rest were unhappy that Northline Flowzone had actually managed to defeat the Ross Empire’s forces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Blaze Realm and the Dire Barbarian Clan should move to help us now,” <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Newmoon</span> spoke calmly while glaring at Hai Qiqi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Houye frowned. “That’s not a wise move. If all three of us move to attack, we will definitely draw unwanted attention upon ourselves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That little girl is very powerful. The Ross Empire won’t be able to defeat her alone,” <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Newmoon</span> said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Houye kept staring at Hai Qiqi as he thought she looked quite familiar. After a while, his eyes went wide when he finally recognized her. “I remember now! This girl was with that young man who killed Jared.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other two looked at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Houye asked coldly, “Do you remember the person who stopped the Que's Mighty Slash with just two fingers at Pyrolyte Lake?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That had been an amazing scene, so of course they both remembered it.</span></p>

This girl was together with that young man at that time, so he must be in the mountain range, too,” Huo Houye explained.</span></p>
