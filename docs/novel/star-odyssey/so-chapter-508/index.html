People would occasionally stare at Lu Yin with shock or fanaticism etched on their faces. Not a single one of them had imagined that this person would prove to be this powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Gang looked at Lu Yin while feeling slightly ridiculous. A peerless Limiteer was a legend, and he was standing so close to this legend.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi looked at Zhanlong Daynight with curiosity, especially at the injuries on his body which were recovering at a discernible rate.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How Interesting.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before long, Zhanlong Daynight let out a breath, sat up, and leaned against the dark red stone wall. He then looked at Lu Yin. “Do you think that I’m afraid of death?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked down on him from above. “Do you belong to the Dayking bloodline, the Nightking clan, or perhaps just the simple Daynight clan?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight’s eyes flashed, and his brows creased. “You know quite a bit.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know more than you can imagine. Your Daynight clan has degenerated greatly. Since you’ve managed to leave Shenwu Continent, there must be something that you want to do. Are you willing to die so easily? Don’t think for a moment that I’d hesitate to kill you now that I have the Sea King’s Dome behind me. The Daynight clan won’t raise any fuss with the Sea King for someone like you who’s not even a Nightking.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight sighed, and then he bitterly smiled. “Well said. Alright, I’ll tell you. Not because you scare me, but because even if I don’t, someone else will just spill the beans. That’s because I’m not the only one who made it out of Shenwu Continent. All of the outsiders who were captured by the Reverent King were released.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin shivered. “What does that mean?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight shrugged. “Martial Emperor Ming Zhaotian was heavily injured by the Scholar Arbiter, and Reverent King Ming Zhaoshu betrayed the Shenwu Empire. He proclaimed himself as the emperor and then started cooperating with the outsiders. Shenwu Continent has completely changed, as the outsiders are no longer hated. Instead, they cooperate with Ming Zhaoshu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was surprised. “Ming Zhaoshu was able to defend himself against attacks from the Shenwu Empire’s Martial Sovereigns?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight sneered, “You underestimate Ming Zhaoshu. His silent endurance is the most impressive out of everyone I’ve ever seen. He grasped the opportunity when Ming Zhaotian was injured to seize the inheritance of the dead Ming Taizhong. With that, he broke through to become a Martial Sovereign, which is the equivalent to the Cruiser realm. He’s now evenly matched with Ming Zhaotian. Besides that, he’s also comprehended a domain, and even a forcefield.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was astounded, as he had already known how formidable Ming Zhaoshu’s mental fortitude was, but he still hadn’t known that it had reached such an extent. A forcefield was an extraordinary power that only a handful of the top geniuses at his age had grasped. And yet, Ming Zhaoshu had done so without even letting anyone finding out until he chose to reveal it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin replayed the various scenes from Shenwu Continent in his mind. The grudge between the crown prince and the Reverent King, the Demon Hunters Society, the Ming Constables, the five sealing planets, and the most memorable: Reverent King Ming Zhaoshu and Lu Yin’s own beloved, Ming Yan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Zhaoshu had once told Lu Yin that he would wait for ten years before forming an alliance with the outsiders to help Shenwu Continent escape from its current predicament. At that time, not only had Ming Zhaoshu exhibited his patient endurance on himself, but he had also used it on Lu Yin. He had decided to use Lu Yin due to his accomplishments during the Astral Combat Tournament. Ming Zhaoshu had also been willing to use Ming Yan as bait, and he had even told Lu Yin about the Tower of Resonating Light’s secret. The Reverent King’s vision and finesse were very impressive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If not for Ming Zhaotian’s sudden injuries, then Ming Zhaoshu definitely would not have rebelled at this time, as not doing so meant losing the opportunity to obtain the inheritance from the Tower of Resonating Light. In the end, Zhanlong Daynight and the rest would not have been able to leave the continent either. They all owed their thanks to Wen Sansi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ming Zhaoshu would not let you off without some kind of good reason. Does he want to cooperate with the Daynight clan?” Lu Yin asked. Even if Ming Zhaoshu had once said that he did not like to cooperate with people who could decide his fate, that had been back then. To obtain Ming Taizhong’s inheritance, Ming Zhaoshu had committed betrayal quicker than expected, and as soon as the pressure became more than he could handle, it was very likely that he would start borrowing the strength of powerful clans from the universe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight replied, “For now, no. But he had me take a message back to my clan. Shenwu Continent is not as simple as it appears to be, and those five sealing planets are not in Ming Taizhong’s style.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was surprised at this news, though it seemed that obtaining Ming Taizhong’s inheritance had given Ming Zhaoshu a deeper level of understanding of Shenwu Continent. He had probably learned a secret that gave him the confidence to release Zhanlong Daynight and bring a message back to the Daynight clan. This indicated that this secret could allow the Daynight clan to help him at any moment so long as a price was paid, though the Reverent King would definitely always make sure that he was in a sure-win situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Anything else aside from this bit of news?” Lu Yin asked, as he was most concerned about Ming Yan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight frowned. “What else do you want to know? I’ve told you everything that’s important.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why did you attack Ming Zhaoshu’s daughter back then?” Lu Yin asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You haven’t figured it out yet? It was to aggravate the conflict between Ming Zhaoshu and Crown Prince Ming Hao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So what happened afterwards? When Ming Zhaoshu’s back was turned, did Crown Prince Ming Hao really not send someone to attack Ming Yan?” Lu Yin asked, as he stared closely into Zhanlong Daynight’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man shook his head. “I don’t know about that. Shenwu Continent has undergone tremendous changes, and no one cares if one girl lives or dies. Still, since she’s Ming Zhaoshu’s daughter, she’ll be fine.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin relaxed, as it seemed like Ming Zhaoshu did not intend to create any fuss about Ming Yan. Lu Yin didn’t dare to ask any further questions out of fear that Zhanlong Daynight would learn about his relationship with Ming Yan. That would expose one more of his weaknesses, and Lu Yin actually had no intention of killing Zhanlong Daynight right now. Even if the Frostwave Weave was now under the Sea King’s Dome, Lu Yin would not follow the Sea King, so he could not risk further ruining his relationship with the Daynight clan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Zhanlong Daynight was a member of the Daynight clan and wasn’t a Nightking, he had still comprehended the Daynight Restoration Technique and thus enjoyed an important status in the Daynight clan. Killing this person would not be much better than killing Nightqueen Yanqing.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight’s brows rose up. “You’re letting me go?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are no grudges between us, and killing you wouldn’t bring me any benefits,” Lu Yin commented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight spat out a mouthful of blood, as his injuries had almost entirely healed by now. He gave Lu Yin a serious look. “I owe you one life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He then jumped up and raced towards Pyrolyte Plain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he watched Zhanlong Daynight rush into the distance, Lu Yin withdrew his gaze. It seemed like he would not be able to wait for much longer. Even though he had used Darkstar Gorge to divert the threat away from Shenwu Continent, its interior would only become more unstable with time. Ming Zhaoshu was a Cruiser, and he was evenly matched against a severely injured Ming Zhaotian, but when the emperor recovered, Ming Zhaoshu would be in trouble. At this moment, he was definitely racking his brain and trying to ensure that Ming Zhaotian wouldn't recover, but how long could that continue on for?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Yan was not very safe in the currently chaotic Shenwu Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the events on Planet Pyrolyte ended, should Lu Yin head to Shenwu Continent? With his current strength, what could he even do there now? He was caught in a dilemma.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That person’s injuries healed amazingly fast. Did he take some kind of medication?” Hai Qiqi asked curiously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin remained silent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi stared at Lu Yin for a bit before deflating. “I’ve already told you that I truly didn’t know. Don’t you trust me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin glanced at her and then commented, “That was Zhanlong Daynight. He’s cultivated the Daynight Restoration Technique, so his recovery speed is more than ten times faster than normal.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi was astonished. “There’s actually such a powerful technique? The Daynight Restoration Technique... Just hearing its name is enough to know that it’s very formidable. So he’s a professional punching bag!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin turned around, as anything could gain new meanings when Hai Qiqi described it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that no Enlighters were appearing to threaten Lu Yin, Northgate Gang and the rest were finally able to relax after a Northline Flowzone cultivator came to inform them of the current situation. The mountain range was absolutely theirs. No, it was more accurate to say that it was Lu Yin’s. No, that was still incorrect; it belonged to the Sea King’s Dome.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one present was a fool; what possible use could Lu Yin have for pyrolyte ore? Even if he obtained it, he wouldn’t be able to use it. Now that Frostwave Weave had become a subsidiary of the Sea King’s Dome, it was no longer able to participate in the conflicts of the Innerverse and Outerverse. The group that would actually obtain the pyrolyte ore was the Sea King’s Dome.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northline Flowzone was distressed about whether or not it would be able to get a share of the portion taken by the Sea King’s Dome. Granny Chan even considered whether or not she should invite Northgate Taisui to have a chat with Elder Ren.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Planet Pyrolyte fell quiet for a period of time. With Elder Ren overseeing things, no one dared to threaten Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A video of the battle at the mountain range was quickly leaked onto the network, and it caused an overwhelming number of people to be astonished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Frostwave Weave, Huo Qingshan, Huo Xiaoling, and the others watched the video, and a sense of pride accompanied their astonishment. This was their Royal Regent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Yu Academy, Schutz, Gerbach, and the other students were all flabbergasted. Behind them, Geraldine, Jeraldine, Veron, Parlie, Eddy, and the other students who had been trial takers on Earth were all dumbfounded as well. This strength was just too terrifying; was this the strength of an unrivaled Limiteer? Lu Yin’s power had surpassed everyone’s understanding, as from their assumptions, even an Explorer could not be this powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those from Earth who had joined the Yu Academy, such as Fu Xiaoshu, Zhen Tong, Song Shi, Zhao Yu, Huan Sha, and Qin Xuan, also saw the video. Most of them watched it fervently, as this video proved that Earthlings were not any weaker than the other students, and they could also have invincible powerhouses hail from their home.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Auna family manor, Jenny Auna passed time in a dim room. She calmly watched the video.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You’ve become much stronger, even much more than back at San Dios. Much, much stronger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In prison, Sigmund Mathers grew emotional when he watched the video with Ruky Mathers beside him. Before, during Astral-10’s entrance exam, Ruky had broken his arm, but he had still managed to obtain a battle technique and become famous throughout Frostwave Weave. Not only had he joined the Yu Academy, but he had even surpassed Gerbach and the others. It had reached the point where he was now the only one who could battle against Schutz.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Ordnance Mercenaries, Dana was intoxicated, and her eyes were hazy. She held onto Ian as she looked at her screen. “Isn’t this the Royal Regent? And you fought him once before, hahahaha!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ian smiled. “Yes, that’s my proudest memory.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he had first lost to Lu Yin, Ian had been ridiculed before he finally joined the Ordnance Mercenaries. Now, the memory of that defeat had transformed, as not everyone could boast of having the experience of battling a legend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the video spread even further, it gradually reached Vastdearth Weave and the Vastdearth Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This person is Young Master’s classmate, Lu Yin!
