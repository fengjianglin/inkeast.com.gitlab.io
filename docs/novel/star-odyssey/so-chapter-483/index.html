Besides her Nightking’s Body, she had also released her four-lined battle force to go against the boundless sword qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight lifted her red sword and struck at the sky.</span></p>

It was way too large, and it would only end up as target practice if he let it out, which would mean that he would have to receive this attack on his own.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hui Chuan’s monster snake was killed in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whether it was the members of the Daynight clan or the Second Grade Hall, everybody was forced to receive Liu Shaoqiu’s attack. With just one move, he’d already taken out most of the powerful opponents on Pyrolyte Mountain. This was Liu Shaoqiu. This was the Thirteen Swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pyrolyte Mountain now held a lot more corpses.</span></p>

Right now, the only people who had survived his attack were either incredibly lucky ones or powerful in their own right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Far in the distance, away from Pyrolyte Mountain, Northgate Gang, Ah Fan, and the others were completely stunned by the fact that somebody was actually attempting to take over Pyrolyte Mountain by themselves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu, a person who’d nearly been forgotten, had just stunned everyone with one move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the Astral Combat Tournament, Liu Shaoqiu had been one of the few participants who had been favored to become the champion. He’d managed to defeat Realm Master Kuang Wang with one move. And whenever he attacked, Starsibyl, Han Chong, Nightqueen Yanqing, and all the other Realm Masters had been forced to become serious. However, he’d lost to Lu Yin. Many believed that his defeat was due to Lu Yin’s luck since Liu Shaoqiu’s sword had broken at a critical moment, causing him to hesitate. That pause had given Lu Yin a chance. Otherwise, nobody would have known who the victor would have been.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, Liu Shaoqiu’s name had spread across the universe. Even though he’d lost, that battle had been likened to the finals of past Astral Combat Tournaments. Liu Shaoqiu wasn’t believed to actually be any weaker than Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, during the Tournament of the Strongest, Liu Shaoqiu had lost to Yun, that woman from the Technocracy, which had caused his popularity to die down. A lot of people had gradually forgotten about him while Lu Yin, Mu Rong, Ling Que, and Ye Xingchen became the four unrivalled Limiteers. Throughout the starry universe, nobody remembered Liu Shaoqiu anymore, the genius from the Sword Sect who had once made a deal with Lu Yin to challenge the Top 100 Rankings together.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Liu Shaoqiu had once again demonstrated just how capable he was. Other than those select others, who else could take out the entirety of Pyrolyte Mountain’s defenses alone? Only Liu Shaoqiu could.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the base of the mountain, Kuang Wang panted hard and glanced at his arm as blood flowed down off of it, dripping from his fingers. He could only smile wryly. The difference between him and Liu Shaoqiu was just too vast. He’d thought that the difference in power between them had decreased, but on the contrary, it had only grown larger. He even found it difficult to defend against two blows from Liu Shaoqiu now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hui Chuan had nearly died. Although he was still technically alive, he had been grievously injured. He wouldn’t be able to fight for a while.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing’s face was pale. She had also defended against quite a few attacks and had nearly succumbed to them. Liu Shaoqiu was much stronger than the past, and his sword was even sharper than before. She had believed that, after training at the Mirror of Clarity within the Lifeseek Realm, she had become much stronger, but evidently, Liu Shaoqiu had made even further strides in his cultivation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight’s red sword was cracked, and she tightly clenched onto the hilt as blood from her right leg stained her pants and dripped down into the ground. She swayed a few times before, finally unable to take it anymore, collapsing. She forced herself to take three Shamrock Enterprises pills as she stared up at the sky. This was the Thirteen Swords, and it was incredibly powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, there was only one person on the mountain who had received Liu Shaoqiu’s Second Sword without taking damage: Zhanlong Daynight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">High in the sky, Liu Shaoqiu’s gaze was fixed on just that one person. Zhanlong Daynight was clearly very powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight grinned. “Nice! I expected nothing less from the Thirteen Swords. You’ve won, so you can take over the mountain.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing was enraged. “Don’t make such decisions on your own, Zhanlong Daynight!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight didn’t even give her a second look. He leaped away from Nightqueen Yanqing with tightly clenched fists as he punched out. Liu Shaoqiu looked incredibly stern, and the area around Zhanlong Daynight distorted as the spatial crack spread out even further. He quickly unsheathed his sword, and upon seeing that Zhanlong Daynight’s fist was closing in on him, he aimed his weapon down. This was the First Sword of the Thirteen Swords. The sword qi in it surpassed what he had released in the Second Sword, and this attack represented all the comprehension he had gathered over the course of his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Each of the Thirteen Swords had something unique about them. It wasn’t that the Second Sword would always be more powerful than the First, as the largest difference between the First and Second Sword was the area that the attacks covered. In order to truly display one’s strength, the First Sword was a better choice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sword clashed against a fist, and everyone saw the void tremble slightly in the sky above them. It almost looked like a small winding stream. The initially small ripple soon transformed into a violent wind that contained a terrifyingly powerful pressure that crushed down upon Pyrolyte Mountain and the surrounding area.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Gang and the others were shocked. Wa- was this still a battle between Limiteers? Impossible! Even a fight between Cruisers wouldn’t be this scary!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After coming to such a conclusion, Ah Fan shouted, “Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rest of the group were also in a rush to escape. A strong wind blew across the ground, and even the ground was torn asunder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Things were even worse at the bottom of Pyrolyte Mountain. Those from the Daynight clan and the Second Grade Hall who had been lucky enough to survive the previous attack were now sent flying along with Zhuo Daynight, Hui Chuan, and the others. Only Kuang Wang and Nightqueen Yanqing were able to remain standing in place despite the strong wind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a giant boom, another gigantic spatial crack spread across the sky, and a cultivator from the Second Grade Hall had the bad luck to be swallowed by it. About a third of his body vanished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A portion of Pyrolyte Mountain collapsed, and the entire geological formation was forced down slightly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thankfully, Pyrolyte Mountain itself acted as a dampening device. Otherwise, this vigorous battle very well could have caused all the pyrolyte ore within it to explode. If that happened, then the survival of everyone in the general area would be left up to fate alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu and Zhanlong Daynight retreated at the same time. They were completely on par with each other.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight looked excited but relieved at the same time. He had believed himself to be all-powerful, but these incredible geniuses kept popping out one after another. Thankfully, his time while being incarcerated in the Reverent King’s estate on the Shenwu Continent had given him the opportunity to break through in the Daynight Restoration Technique, or else he’d have fallen behind these geniuses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had been planning on going after Lu Yin and having another duel with him, but to his surprise, Lu Yin had defeated Mu Rong and been crowned as the most powerful Limiteer. While Zhanlong Daynight was confident in himself, he was still likely a bit weaker than Lu Yin. Hence, he had obeyed the orders from his clan and headed to Planet Pyrolyte. He was planning on defeating various powerhouses in this contest for pyrolyte ore, experiencing another breakthrough in the Daynight Restoration Technique, and then challenging Lu Yin again after that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight was going to claim the title of the strongest Limiteer for himself before becoming an Explorer. Then, he would take his place on the Top 100 Rankings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was like a huge mountain pressing down upon everyone else within the same realm, making it hard for them to breathe. It wasn’t just Zhanlong Daynight; Liu Shaoqiu, Nightqueen Yanqing, Han Chong, Ling Que, Mu Rong, and everyone else was currently stuck beneath him. Every Limiteer wanted to defeat Lu Yin. They were currently on another battlefield, but the winner would still just be someone who was weaker than Lu Yin. The moment that person was decided, they would have to challenge Lu Yin while carrying the weight of everybody’s expectations on their shoulders.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although nobody had actually said this, it was something that everybody instinctively knew. Only the final person to remain standing on this battlefield would have the right to challenge the strongest Limiteer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Lu Yin hadn’t appeared on Planet Pyrolyte, his existence alone was a part of the reason why these people were fighting. For young people like them, the value of pyrolyte ore wasn’t nearly as motivating as the chance to challenge Lu Yin. They were from different generations, and the way they thought was obviously different.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For people like Nightqueen Qiuyu, the pyrolyte ore was the most important thing on this planet. But for the youths fighting on the frontlines, the allure of being crowned as the strongest Limiteer was something beyond imagination.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sky became the main battlefield, and rampant shockwaves ruthlessly swept across the region. Spatial cracks fell down like little raindrops.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The void on Planet Pyrolyte was quite stable, and it was much stronger than most other places in the universe. But even so, for Zhanlong Daynight and Liu Shaoqiu, this wasn’t much different than a battle in the trial zones. Their battle was incredibly alarming, and it came as quite a surprise to the large organizations hovering above Planet Pyrolyte. This was basically a battle between two of the strongest Limiteers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a duel between the strongest youths from the Sword Sect and the Daynight clan, and it represented a battle that would decide who would gain control of Pyrolyte Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Daynight clan could not lose. If they did, their reputation would suffer enormously. Liu Shaoqiu had challenged the entirety of the Daynight clan’s Limiteers on his own, which was &nbsp;already humiliating. Nightqueen Qiuyu was watching the battle on Planet Pyrolyte very closely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sword Sect could not lose either. As the one in control of First Flowzone, they had been waiting for a chance to undermine the Daynight clan, and this was their moment to strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a coincidence that both sides had people among the Ten Arbiters. Right now, this was a battle that would decide who had the stronger Limiteer. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A huge explosion caused Northgate Gang and the others to retreat even further as they stared into the distance, terrified. They were afraid that the battle would cause the buried pyrolyte ore to explode, which would be a true disaster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The duel lasted for more than a dozen exchanges, and Zhanlong Daynight had a delighted expression. Veins popped out from his body, and at some point, he’d received a huge cut from his back to his chest. He’d been injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Liu Shaoqiu looked glum. He’d taken one attack from Zhanlong Daynight, and the drip of blood on the corner of his lips was incredibly eye-catching.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two were evenly matched. Liu Shaoqiu’s skills were unrivaled and could hurt Zhanlong Daynight, but the latter’s Restoration Technique allowed Zhanlong Daynight to recover at an abnormal rate. It didn’t take long for the horrible slash on his body to heal and disappear entirely.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu looked astonished when he saw that; this was his first time fighting such a monster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight licked his lips. “The Thirteen Swords. Let’s keep going.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu sighed. He raised his sword and closed his eyes. At this moment, the sky changed, and everything fell silent. Right after that, sword qi wildly surged forth and covered the entire sky. It was a forcefield. Liu Shaoqiu had unleashed the Fourth Sword. Against a true powerhouse from the Daynight clan, the experience from countless years had taught the Sword Sect that the Third Sword was useless; only the Fourth Sword would be effective.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight grew serious. A domain, when powerful enough, would condense into a forcefield that could alter the very environment. This particular forcefield had turned the surrounding area into a world of swords. This was the Fourth Sword, and it lived up to its status as one of the Thirteen Swords. This attack gave Zhanlong Daynight a sense of danger, but that only made him more excited.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Daynight Restoration Technique blazed to life at full power on Zhanlong Daynight’s body, causing strange ripples to form on his skin, making it seem as if his body was literally pulsing with life. His insane regeneration rate could almost be seen as his muscles bulged and a strong aura forced the sword qi away from his body. The ground within a thousand meters of him started cracking before being reduced to powder.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everybody anxiously watched the battle. This should be the final exchange. The two had skipped past the testing phase of the battle and directly entered the actual fight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Far in the distance, Ah Fan had a grim expression. Although he had already run quite far away, it still didn’t feel like he was far enough. A battle between two Limiteer powerhouses could affect a huge region, and if given enough time, they could destroy an entire planet. Even if he ran so far away that he could no longer see these two, he still wouldn’t feel safe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Gang felt the same, and he kept cursing to himself. The fight between these two bastards was even more ridiculous than the one with Northgate Lie. Northgate Lie was an expert on the Top 100 Rankings and was even an Explorer. However, he wasn’t nearly as powerful as these two Limiteers. They were absolute freaks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t just the two of them. Even further away, there were quite a few people who could also tell that they were still in danger. Powder continuously fell from the sky as a gigantic fissure snaked across the ground. Far below, it was possible to see boiling hot magma, the heat was intense enough to warp the void. Just the sight alone was frightening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a bang, and two figures crashed into each other like colliding meteorites, sending out the most powerful shockwave yet. It peeled away multiple layers of the ground underneath them. Fortunately, the two were fighting above Pyrolyte Mountain, so the force was spread out and did not directly strike the mountain. Otherwise, the force definitely would have caused the pyrolyte ore within the mountain to explode, resulting in a huge disaster.</span></p>
