 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

This opponent was a peak Sentinel, but that meant nothing; nearly everyone capable of participating in the Astral Combat Academy assessment was at this point; the numbers weren’t all that important. Not too far away, he saw a male with reddish skin charging over, arms sparking to form a flaming spear as they brushed against each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fireforge scum!” Ayker screamed and engaged in battle, but it took less than half a minute for him to be struck by the spear. His abdomen was charred by the flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the price that the Great Yu Empire has to pay for humiliating Young Master Feng,” the man snickered, pulling the spear out and dropping a lifeless body to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene repeated in quite a few places. The people from the Fireforge Planet seemed to know exactly &nbsp;when the Great Yu Empire landed, and anyone that descended during this period of time was considered an enemy. The young person who’d been leading the group looked at the body that was gradually getting colder and spat at him, “Yan Zheng will exact vengeance for his older brother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another crash rang out and sent heat waves his way. Yan Zheng glanced westward and smirked cruelly, flying off in that direction. A pod had formed a conical pit in the ground only moments earlier, and a youth opened the hatch and disembarked. Yan Zheng saw this new target and rubbed his hands together without second thought, thrusting a flaming spear at the young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person in question looked up, his eyes glinting. “Desolate Palm!” His palm turned an earthen color and smashed into the spear, sending shockwaves in all directions as the spear cracked inch by inch. Yan Zheng was shocked and his pupils shrank as he felt a sharp pain in his chest; the youth had sent him flying with one move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The opponent didn’t even look at the result as he flew off, leaving Yan Zheng to spit out a second mouthful of blood as he crashed into a cliff. He nearly died from that one attack, barely able to speak amid all the coughing, “Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re not dead yet?” The youth was surprised, but didn’t stop his departure. “My name is Meng Yue. If you’ve got the skills, you can come look for your vengeance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Zheng knelt down in pain. Fortunately, it wasn’t long before two of his subordinates came over. They were astounded, “Young Master, who managed to wound you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did not answer, simply drinking a healing potion. Soon enough, two more arrived and surrounded him. Some time later, he opened his eyes and panted. That attack hadn’t just destroyed his battle technique, but also left him seriously injured. It felt like his life had been sucked out of him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Desolate Palm? Why did that sound familiar?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Check that pod and see if there’s anything special on it,” he said frailly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of his subordinates flew over and returned in an instant, “The word Vastdearth was on its back, Young Master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Zheng’s expression quickly changed. The Vastdearth Sect was an immense organization that possessed land quite the distance from the Frostwave Weave.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Desolate Palm that had been able to injure him in one blow, a youth named Men Yue… Right, that was the young lord of the Vastdearth Sect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only now that Yan Zheng knew who he’d been dealing with—the genius of the Vastdearth Sect, a lunatic who had remained a Sentinel for a long time for the sake of fully exploring the realm’s capabilities. That man had once been invited to join the Outerverse Youth Council, but had rejected the position. He was a Sentinel capable of defeating Melders with innate gifts; a pure monster.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No wonder he was so powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Zheng sighed. Revenge was impossible when it came to people like this. If he saw Meng Yue again, he was better off avoiding him. He turned to his subordinates, “Where are the other two?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of them hesitated and looked grim, “They’re dead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How?!” Yan Zheng was furious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“One of them was killed by a mutant beast here, and the other died at the hands of a cultivator from the Empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Zheng clenched his fists, “Who was it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know. I’ve never seen him before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was nothing Yan Zheng could do in this situation. He’d been too narrow-minded. This was the trial for Astral-10 that had gathered countless geniuses. The Fireforge Planet could do as it liked on the Frostwave Weave, but that did not extend to their neighbors. “Let’s rest a little; we’ll avenge them after we enter the Academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These people heaved a sigh of relief and could not help but celebrate inside. They were afraid of the young master’s quick temper and the trouble that would bring. There were far too many monsters here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elsewhere, Lu Yin met up with Lulu who’d landed nearby.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s compete to see who’ll get there first!” Lulu was eager to give this a go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin glanced at his gadget. “Sure. I’m waiting for someone though, so give me a moment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was confused, “Is there someone else coming with us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m planning on sending him away,” he said with an icy look in his eyes. Lulu didn’t understand at all, but instead of explaining, he just grinned, “He’s here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not too far away, Ghostfire flew along leisurely. His innate gift was very suited to this environment. All of a sudden, he paused and looked ahead. “It’s you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin moved forward, “I’ve been waiting for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ghostfire snickered, “Sorry, I just killed a piece of trash that said he was from the Fireforge Planet and was agonizing over where I could find you. I can’t believe you have the guts to appear before me. Are you trying to die?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin clenched his fists, “I’ll settle the score with Bazeer later, but I’ll be collecting some interest from you first.” His figure blinked towards his target in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s nothing here that can stop me, you ant! I’ll show you how powerful my flames are!” Ghostfire scorned, black flames burning his body into void. This innate gift shocked Lulu; It was something that could help avoid all physical attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin snorted and punched out, day and night intersecting with his blow. The Daynight Clan was one of the most powerful existences in the universe and had passed down powerful battle techniques over generations. Those techniques could crush countless unique innate gifts, and these flames were no different. The Daynight Punch contained both a physical and spiritual component, and it was only facing Ghostfire that Lu Yin understood why. These techniques were conceited beyond belief, with no weaknesses at all. They could be weak, but they would at least be effective.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ghostfire’s disdain was quickly followed by confusion. He felt his body being torn apart, darkness and light flickering before his eyes like time was passing in an instant. He knew that this was a deception, but was unable to do anything about it. Extreme fatigue ended his flames in a moment, and his body became opaque once more. Lu Yin pressed his palm into the deathly-pale youth’s abdomen, “This is exactly what will happen to Bazeer in the future. Three Stacks Threefold Shockwave Palm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shockwaves rippled through the air as Ghostfire crashed into the ground, forming a huge pit. He coughed out blood, but things weren’t over just yet. A second and third explosion rang out as the pit grew larger, knocking him out instantly. Floating in the skies, Lu Yin gradually reined in the chill in his eyes as he looked down upon the pitiful youth. This really was just interest; Bazeer would end up a hundred times worse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Lulu had seen everything from start to finish. It had begun and ended very quickly. She’d first been astonished by Ghostfire’s innate gift, and then shocked by Lu Yin’s Three Stacks Threefold Shockwave Palm, “You’ve improved again. That’s an amazing attack!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin chuckled, “Let’s go. We’ll see who reaches first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sure,” she sped up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Yue appeared in the vicinity after the two of them had left, landing to check Ghostfire’s pitiful state. He was astounded, “Three Stacks and the Shockwave Palm? Interesting.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, on a spacecraft belonging to the Great Yu Empire, Dorren Yushan and the others on board received news about the status of the students taking part in the exam. The Melders’ exam had only just begun, while that for the Sentinels had basically ended, because only a small number of people were left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A student has sent word that they’re being pursued by people from the Fireforge Planet,” somebody reported.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dorren looked grim, “The Fireforge Planet? Seems like they’re planning on waging war on our Great Yu Empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rocky Auna said, “It shouldn’t come to that. Yan Gang paved the way so that Yan Feng could pursue Princess Wendy; it wouldn’t make sense for them to attack us at such a time. There’s only one possibility, which is that the person attacking doesn’t know the situation and thinks we’ve humiliated Yan Feng by ending the arrangement.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yan Feng has a younger brother called Yan Zheng, who’s a Sentinel. He’s probably the one responsible for this,” the Crown Prince said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shall we talk to the people of the &nbsp;Fireforge Planet?” someone asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dorren answered, “It’s fine, the Fireforge Planet isn’t that powerful. If we can’t get past them, it’ll be impossible for us to enter the Astral Combat Academy.”</span></p>
