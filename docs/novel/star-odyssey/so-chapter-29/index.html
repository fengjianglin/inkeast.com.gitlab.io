 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For some strange reason, Borise’s heart clenched and her back turned cold. She whirled around, startled to discover a cold stare from a beautiful woman that she hadn’t discovered in however long. She passed it off as a side-effect of her injury, focusing on the appearance of this beauty in red boots and a snow white skirt, waist-length blue hair a stark contrast from the dark red earth, “Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The stunning woman seemed devoid of all emotion as she asked a question of her own in response, “Are you the one who summoned the beast wave?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Borise stared intensely at the woman, growing more and more jealous of her peerless beauty. Of all the women she had ever seen in her life, only Starsibyl could compare.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How did such a pure and untouched beauty exist in this universe?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll ask once more; did you start this beast wave?” the gorgeous woman asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who are you?” Borise repeated herself, wariness growing in her gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bai Xue,” the woman replied calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bai Xue the Water Sage?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Xue’s frosty gaze passed beyond Borise, landing on the bloody battlefield, “What was your goal with unleashing these beasts?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph. A mere native has no right to speak to me. Watch me tear your face apart!” Borise grabbed forward, a bestial roar sounding from her palm that could send a chill down anyone’s spine. Layers of ice appeared in front of Bai Xue as she retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did you think you can stop me with some dumb plant’s ice?” Borise charged right through, “You natives are so stupid.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Xue came to a stop and raised her palm towards the alien, causing the ground to freeze and the winds in the forest to change directions. Borise was unphased by the attack and raised her own palm, “You’re asking to die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though she hadn’t yet recovered from her injuries, Borise felt nothing but contempt for Bai Xue. She let out a low growl and the ice exploded, the impact ripping open the sleeve of Bai Xue’s blouse and spilling a few stalks of icy grass. This was the exact same plant that powered Zhao Yu’s Frost Palm, working in a similar way to fire crystals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Anticipating a look of desperation, Borise stared down at Bai Xue with a gaze steeped with pride, “I told you that some plant ice would be useless!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, a frozen wind suddenly buffeted her from all sides, freezing the ground solid. A layer of frost solidified in the air, causing the blood to drain from Borise’s face, “No… That can’t be. This is the innate gift of Frost; you have an innate gift?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Xue’s gaze remained unchanged as an endless sequence of gusts rushed towards Borise, freezing her arms in a moment. The girl squealed and tried to escape, but it was already too late. Her entire body froze solid in a mere two seconds and she toppled to the ground, shattering into a million pieces. The top student of Blue Mountain Academy had died just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Borise’s death immediately returned self-control to the mutant beasts on the battlefield, prompting many of them to start retreating. Bai Xue let loose a sigh of fatigue; the girl had actually been quite powerful. If not for the previous injury, there was a chance that she could have struggled free. Even with the advantage of being underestimated, she herself had been forced to use her innate gift of Frost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back in the city, Veron and Parlie had already searched Zhang Dingtian’s residence as well as the office of the deceased Primary without finding anything. Lu Yin had reached the capital as well, entering the city with Jeraldine in tow. The two encountered a sober atmosphere, but one that lacked the chaos he’d expect from a city under attack. Even when terrified, the survivors of the capital remained confident in the Chinese troops.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter how prosperous China’s cities had been during peacetime, they had all been ruined to the same extent by the Apocalypse. Bridges were broken, houses had collapsed, and most buildings were too ruined to live in. Just a place to sleep was now a luxury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Yin found a map of the capital and led Jeraldine straight to Zhang Dingtian’s residence, his reasoning being the same as Veron and the others who believed Zhang Dingtian was most likely to know the whereabouts of the corpse. Said man was currently atop the steel walls, focused on a distant white fog that he knew was produced by Bai Xue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bladesage, look there!” someone exclaimed, drawing the gazes of everyone nearby. A sea of white froze the ground in the middle of the battlefield between the mutant beasts and zombies, a gorgeous woman walking out of the fog and freezing every creature she passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Water Sage! Water Sage Bai Xue!” someone else shouted in excitement, prompting a chorus of cheers. The Seven Sages of China were upheld as the guardian angels after the Apocalypse, and Bai Xue was placed on a distinct pedestal as the only woman among their number. Her mere appearance renewed the vigor of the soldiers here, convincing them to give it their all in battle. Beauty could be considered its own form of strength; it could stir the potential in some individuals, causing them to ignore their struggles and pain. All of Beijing seemed to roar out in delight at Bai Xue’s arrival, striking fear into the mutants that were still on the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Xue headed towards Zhang Dingtian who was still staring at the battlefield, “I took care of the one who triggered the beast wave. It was a student from outer space.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you,” he said mechanically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She continued coldly, “You’re too soft. Even if you don’t kill them, you should at least capture them. These people don’t even see us as human beings.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Dingtian growled lowly, “I killed five. These last few proved to be quite difficult.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Xue was taken aback, “Difficult? Enough that you couldn’t kill them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Dingtian looked at Bai Xue, “Even we Sages are divided into the three High Sages and the four Sages. The students from outer space should also have their own divisions. The person you killed a bit ago was no pushover either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Xue remained silent. Borise had indeed forced her to use her innate gift, something even the four Sages could not accomplish. At her peak, that girl would likely have strength equivalent to a High Sage. Her attention was suddenly pulled to something about the Bladesage’s statements, “You said last few. What happened to the rest?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Dingtian suddenly narrowed his eyes, “I don’t know.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Xue took out the personal gadget that she had plundered, tapping it a few times to activate the scanner. The screen quickly started beeping and she gasped, “Eight. There are eight experts in the Realm of Sky here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Bladesage’s eyes went wide with towering rage;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">eight cultivators at that level were enough to destroy the entire capital!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;“They’re looking to die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Across the city, as Lu Yin and Jeraldine were closing in on Zhang Dingtian’s residence, the latter suddenly froze up in shock. Lu Yin followed her gaze to two men, one tall and one short, that were dressed far better than most survivors. More importantly, the shorter man looked truly unique at only a little more than a meter tall with quite a stocky build. This was a body that would be noticed anywhere. These two were Veron and Parlie, who had just emerged empty-handed from Zhang Dingtian’s residence. About to head somewhere else, they had coincidentally bumped into Lu Yin and Jeraldine.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Veron and Parlie were quite distinct, and so were Lu Yin and Jeraldine. The girl was exceptionally eye-catching; women’s rights had been trampled after the Apocalypse, so a woman as attractive as Jeraldine would definitely stand out in the crowd. Veron immediately recognized her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Veron!” she gasped, instinctively moving towards Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Veron?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Yin focused his gaze. He had heard the name of the First Military School’s strongest student a number of times but hadn’t expected to encounter him so quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Veron was also surprised to see Jeraldine. The capital was the obvious investigation spot if one wished to actually work on the trial’s mission, but he couldn’t help but laugh at the idea of her trying to do so. He quickly moved his gaze to Lu Yin, but feeling the weak star energy of a new Sentinel, he believed this other youth was just trash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you know each other?” Parlie asked quietly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’re from the same academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bring them along, we need manpower,” Parlie grunted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Veron nodded and turned to the two, “Follow us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A hint of fear flashed across Jeraldine’s eyes and she looked at Lu Yin. Although the trials were open to everyone, anyone who wasn’t a friend or relative could be considered an enemy even if they were from the same school. As far as she was concerned, although Lu Yin controlled her, he didn’t make her fear for her life like Veron did; fellow students were far more ruthless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I told you to get over here! Are you deaf?” Veron shouted loudly, drawing several gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Parlie frowned, “Lower your voice.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Veron gave Jeraldine an icy glare, but Lu Yin took a few steps forward and looked at him indifferently, “Who do you think you’re talking to? Pipe down.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Veron was a little startled by this; he had never expected a new Sentinel to have the guts to speak out like this. He sneered in response, “I don’t know which school you’re from, but they’ll have to remove your name from their records today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He pushed his palm downwards, ripples spreading in all directions and affecting many nearby survivors. Lu Yin raised an eyebrow at the Spacerender Palm, copying the enemy’s movements and synchronizing a forward thrust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two identical attacks clashed in the sky, and all everyone in the area heard was a loud bang as gusts of winds blasted the walls apart and even collapsed the bridge nearby. The sky cracked where the attacks collided, forming a vacuum that sucked in air from all directions.</span></p>

 <p>Hey guys, long time no see! Felt kinda weird being quiet the past six months, but boy is it refreshing. Maybe transitioning from <a href="https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Warlock of the Magus World</u></strong></a> to <a href="https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/city-of-sin" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>City of Sin</u></strong></a> so quickly wasn't the best idea? Well, spilled milk; it's not like we haven't been translating just because we didn't post. You guys have been so kind as to love our last two books, so I guess the pressure was pretty high to follow up with the third? It was for me, anyway; I didn't just want another perspective on a D&amp;D-inspired book, I believe...</p>
