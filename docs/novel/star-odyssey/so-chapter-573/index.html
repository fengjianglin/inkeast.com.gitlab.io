He had once used his entire strength to force the <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Oolong</span> Horse back. Although it had just been an Explorer, it was famous for its strength, and it was even stronger than the Cruiser realm astral beast before him. Lu Yin had not been afraid of contesting that horse’s strength, let alone the astral beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had no idea how badly he had just shocked Charon, but the young Explorer was currently doubting whether or not his own path of cultivation was the right one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The astral beasts surged towards them from all directions, and all of these creatures were all at least at the Limiteer realm. Lu Yin didn’t even understand how the Astral Beast Domain had produced so many formidable beasts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ghost Monkey explained that all astral beasts would reach a certain level of strength upon maturing and that such creatures had no need to cultivate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Astral beasts boasted powerful innate gifts while humans were better at creation.</span></p>

Charon panted heavily, and his hand holding the Unveiled Sword was a bit shaky. Fresh blood dripped down from his shoulder onto the back of his hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had been ambushed by a Cruiser realm beast, and he would have likely died if not for Lu Yin’s support.&nbsp;</span></p>

After that, they had surrounded him with a huge group of Limiteer realm beasts in an attempt to stifle him to death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the battle began, Aden had used his thunder shield to firmly push a Hunter beast towards the mainland where Lu Yin was stationed. Once he saw that Lu Yin was safe, he continued to push that Hunter back away. It almost looked as if they were on a tour.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Qingshan took similar actions to check on Lu Yin.</span></p>

A creature composed of blue crystals roared at the sky as its body grew larger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s an Amethyst Beast! How strange. Why would one of those appear here?” the monkey shrieked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stared at the crumbling mainland, as that was where the reinforcements from the Great Yu Empire had been stationed. They had only arrived two days before, but their future seemed inauspicious at this moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro! Seventh Bro, I’m talking to you!” the monkey shouted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin endured his sorrow. “Speak.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He then turned back around and struck out with his fists to carve out a path through the surrounding beasts. Even just the aftershocks from his attacks were enough to almost injure Charon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s an Amethyst Beast! There aren’t even twenty of those in the entire Astral Beast Domain! They all live in the Celestial Beast Empire, but one of them actually appeared here today! Something isn’t right. Your stronghold is in terrible danger! Hurry up and call Aden!” The Ghost Monkey was becoming more and more anxious with each passing moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do you mean?” Lu Yin had a bad premonition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Amethyst Beasts are a strange existence—much like the Cosmic Hous<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>nobody even knows how the first one was born. Since ancient times, they’ve been rare. Even during their most prolific era, there were only ever thirty of them. Each one of them is very precious, but one of them is here right now, which means that the astral beasts are absolutely confident in their ability to take over this stronghold. If that wasn’t the case, then there’s no way the Celestial Beast Empire would let an Amethyst Beast come here,” the monkey solemnly explained.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin wondered whether or not he should immediately contact Aden and Huo Qingshan to have them head over towards him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The intense snarl shook space itself. To the massive Seasons Fort, such an effect wasn’t anything much, but to the continent that Lu Yin was on, it was enough to make it crumble. Blue crystals appeared, reflecting the cold starlight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a Cruiser realm Amethyst Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s just a Cruiser. I can handle this,” Lu Yin said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monkey hurriedly stopped him. “Seventh Bro, this freak can morph. Don’t take the risk.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Give me some details.” Lu Yin was impatient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“An Amethyst Beast has three forms. The first is its normal form, which isn’t too eye-catching. The second is a blue crystal form that increases its power by an entire level. The third is the amethyst form, which increases its power by yet another level. As soon as this monster reaches a certain level, it will become unequaled within its realm because no one will be able to break through its defenses! These things are absolute freaks!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin frowned, as this information meant that the Amethyst Beast was a thorny problem. According to the monkey, the Celestial Beast Empire was very protective of these rare beasts, and they were not allowed out unless there was no fear for their life. It seemed like Seasons Fort was in grave peril.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin passed on a message detailing the current circumstances to Liu Zhan, as he trusted that Liu Zhan would inform Liu Qiuyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Amethyst Beast demonstrated its overbearing nature by causing the mainland to crumble. Lu Yin pulled Charon away and retreated, but they were still caught up in the destruction.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Charon stared at the distant Amethyst Beast in shock. Its blue, crystalline figure was rather conspicuous, and it made the creature an immediate focus for the entire battlefield. However, none of the human powerhouses’ attacks or shots from all sorts of firearms were able to cause it any harm. Even a Hunter’s attacks weren’t enough to damage it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The beast was almost unparalleled within the same realm as far as its defenses were concerned, and it could even cross realms and repel a Hunter’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Zhan suddenly appeared and slashed at the Amethyst Beast’s body, causing a portion of the blue crystals to be sliced off. The beast howled in rage, and its color changed quickly to purple. A terrifying fluctuation rippled out from the beast and stunned many people. The beast’s strength had now reached the level of a Hunter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Liu Zhan was one of the top five powerhouses at Seasons Fort, a single slash of his sword wasn’t able to cause the creature any harm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes narrowed. Even the Yin Guai from before hadn’t been able to withstand Liu Zhan’s strike so casually, and it had needed to recover from the attacks as well. On the other hand, this Amethyst Beast didn’t seem to be fazed by anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a thump, and Liu Zhan was sent flying by a slap from the beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was speechless, and he suddenly realized that every time he saw Liu Zhan, the young Hunter was being trashed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Zhan himself was also feeling depressed. He had protected Seasons Fort for so many years, and most battle required the enemy to mobilize a few Hunter beasts to stop him. After all, he had a power level of 180,000. However, this time, it was different. Quite a few powerful beasts had appeared recently, such as the Yin Guai during the previous battle, or the Amethyst Beast this time. Truthfully, Liu Zhan had not run into such powerful Hunter realm astral beasts during all his years in Ironblood Weave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom boom boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ground started rupturing as the beast shattered half of the mainland with its thrashing. It then looked in Lu Yin’s direction. It leapt up and crashed into that section of the mainland, hitting even the space station with its attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Charon grabbed Lu Yin and was about to fly into space when, all of a sudden, there was a tremendous roar as Aden appeared and lightning descended. His thunder shield expanded outwards, and he plummeted towards the Amethyst Beast, which remained fearless even as the thunder shield collided against it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a bang as the void collapsed into a blackhole that swallowed everything. But then, it vanished in an instant. A giant shockwave caused many of the nearby soldiers and cultivators to feel dizzy, and it looked like the sky itself had shattered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The distorted void even influenced the battles in outer space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many could see that the thunder shield had stopped the Amethyst Beast in its tracks, and Aden grinned. “So it’s actually an Amethyst Beast. It looks like the Celestial Beast Empire has finally started to move.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The beast used star energy to vibrate the air and produce sound. “Human, you’re very powerful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aden laughed. “I’ve long since wanted to test an Amethyst Beast’s unequaled defense and see whose is stronger—yours or mine.” His thunder shield expanded yet again as lightning flickered across it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The beast bellowed and swatted at the shield. There was another thump, and the entire region quivered while countless spatial cracks shot out like raindrops.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin and Charon dodged the aftershocks from the two powerhouses’ clash as they stared into space. This was a battle of defenders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Zhan appeared, wanting to join the fray, but he was blocked by another Hunter beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin and Charon moved to a different battlefield, as the mainland was on the verge of collapsing. There was no need to defend it any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the astral beasts left the mainland alone, and both sides essentially wrote it off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two passed by the space station, and Lu Yin was dragged along by Charon as they dashed towards another planet that was smaller than the mainland that they had been on before. However, this one supported an ecosystem that the earlier mainland had lacked. When they looked up, they were able to see straight into space.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One planet connected two mainlands. This was how the strongholds were constructed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This planet was similar to the mainland in the sense that there were astral beasts all around them with corpses forming oceans of blood. Things had even reached the point where the seas had been stained red.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin and Charon rejoined the battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Above the fortress, the battle between the Amethyst Beast and Aden intensified. The creature was furious, as it had never met any human whose defenses could compare to its own. The purple crystals on its body sparkled radiantly. “Human, you can’t best me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aden looked back at the beast with a serious face. “You really are an Amethyst Beast. I’ll show my true strength now.” The star energy from Aden’s body transformed into lightning that then formed a mountain. He had formed a thunder mountain, and this was his Thunder Mountain Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immovable like a mountain; fierce like thunder. This phrase had been well-interpreted by Aden, and he used the mountain’s solid defense and the lightning’s incomparable ferocity to push the Amethyst Beast back into outer space.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, Liu Qiuyu, who had been keeping an eye on the battle, was amazed. He had seen this technique before, but it did not seem to be something from the Outerverse. Could it be from the Neoverse?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a similar fashion to when he had first arrived at Seasons Fort, Aden revealed a defense that left others dumbfounded. This time, he was pushing the Amethyst Beast through outer space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless human cultivators were inspired, as this was a display of power that could cause their morale to soar.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The beast’s eyes went wide. “Human, you’ve aggravated me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The purple radiance on its body erupted with radiance once again, and this time, its colors deepened, and the crystals seemed to absorb the nearby light. Then, waves rippled out from the purple crystals, like when a stone was dropped in a pond. Suddenly, Aden’s thunder shield was pulled into the beast’s body and absorbed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die, human!” It swatted at Aden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aden had lost his thunder shield, and he was thus smacked away by the Amethyst Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dynamics of the battle had switched too quickly, and in the distance, Liu Qiuyu’s heart sank. This was an innate gift that was unique to the strange lifeforms that were the Amethyst Beasts. This creature was definitely from the Celestial Beast Empire, and the empire wanted to rely on this beast to destroy Seasons Fort. Since they had dared to send the beast to Ironblood Weave, it meant that the stronghold was in serious danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The beast snarled and charged towards Seasons Fort, as its mission was to destroy this stronghold. No one could stop it, and even an Enlighter could not do such a thing. The beast’s defense was matchless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Qiuyu’s sword forced away the Enlighter beast that he had been fighting. He wanted to attack the Amethyst Beast, but he was almost instantly obstructed again by the Enlighter beast. “Liu Qiuyu, this battlefield will be the last thing you will see. Seasons Fort is finished.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Qiuyu was flustered, as no one aside from him could stop the Amethyst Beast. No—even he was not confident in being able to stop the beast. As long as it set its heart on destroying the stronghold, he would be out of options.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Aden, who had been sent flying, suddenly tore through the void and reappeared. His face was so gloomy that it was scary, and when he emerged from the void, he was in front of the Amethyst Beast. He looked up as purple veins spread across his entire body and a red radiance shot into the sky with a vibrancy that could cause passions to boil. He had activated nine lined battle force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire stronghold was shocked by his nine lined battle force. In the past, even the strongest cultivator at the fort had only ever displayed eight lined battle force, but a nine lined battle force user had suddenly appeared out of the blue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A powerful warrior was someone who had a clear conscience as well as a determination that came from their heart. They could manifest that will and wield it for attack or defense, or even to break through their limits to crush the heavens and tear the sky apart.</span></p>
