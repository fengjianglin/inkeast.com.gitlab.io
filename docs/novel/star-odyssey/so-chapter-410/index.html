He still owed the Outerverse Youth Council one blackhole-grade spacecraft.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No, I owe Wendy Yushan.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;That spacecraft was reserved for Wendy Yushan’s exclusive use, but it had been destroyed by him.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was roused by the screams. “What’s the matter?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Look! The other spacecraft are all turning around and heading back!” the monkey shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked ahead of him and saw that every spacecraft was streaking past him and dashing in the opposite direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin felt that something wasn’t right, especially when he saw a collision that subsequently caused two personal spacecraft in front of him to explode. He decisively changed their route and returned in the direction that they had come from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It should be known that spacecraft automatically recalculated their routes, so if two spacecraft approached the other too closely, both would reroute, making it normally impossible for vessels to collide. The only ways for such incidents to occur were if the spacecraft’s system was uncalibrated or if the pilot was so panicked that they had set the spacecraft into manual mode.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s that?” the monkey shouted anxiously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked up and narrowed his eyes when he saw a grey flood engulfing everything in front of them. It moved rapidly, swallowing up one spacecraft after another. Every time it devoured one, the grey flood would pause briefly, but it would quickly rush forward once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin finally understood why the spacecraft had attempted to flee in such a panicked manner. This was a storm! That bastard Feng Shang had even said that it would be difficult for him to run into one on this route, but he had met one as soon as he arrived.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“RUN, SEVENTH BRO!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked at his ship’s system but then saw that the navigation system had been destroyed by the storm, leaving the spacecraft unable to calculate a new route. Lu Yin was left with no choice, so he selected a random direction and dashed forwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Numerous spacecraft were swallowed one after another, all of them vanishing in the blink of an eye. The radiant-grade spacecraft was not that slow, and it flew about as fast as the storm advanced. Lu Yin relaxed, as the storm should not last for too long, and at this rate, he should be able to easily escape.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Be careful!” the monkey shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin gritted his teeth, as his spacecraft had slightly tilted to the left and almost crashed into a nearby spacecraft. He was finished if he collided with another ship, since he would definitely be swallowed by the storm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, a small spacecraft similar to Lu Yin’s turned around and flew in the opposite direction of the approaching storm. It was also a radiant-grade spacecraft and was much more valuable than Lu Yin’s single-person vessel, though its speed was comparable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, only radiant-grade spacecraft were fast enough to escape the fate of being swallowed by the storm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Star energy filled Lu Yin’s eyes, and he focused on the scene before him, afraid that he might collide with a spacecraft that randomly appeared in his way. Suddenly, he sensed rune lines on his right. He saw that many lines had abnormally started converging. When he turned around, he saw that there was a person standing atop a small spacecraft, staring at him with cold eyes. Within the man’s palm was an attack, charging with energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes narrowed upon seeing this bad situation. This person wanted to use him to slow the storm’s advance so that he would have a greater chance of escaping. From the amount of converging rune lines, this person was a Cruiser, and not just a normal one either. Otherwise, he would not have been able to afford a radiant-grade spacecraft.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, be careful!” the monkey shouted again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin released the Ghost Monkey. “You control the spacecraft!” He then retrieved an object from his cosmic ring, which was the Money Bomb that he had just bought from Old Cai. Since the opponent wanted to kill him, he would not just sit around and wait for his death.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Cai, I hope that you weren’t messing around and that this toy actually works.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To his right, there were more than ten people in the small spacecraft. “Captain, attack! Who knows how much longer the storm will last for, and we might not actually be able to escape.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That Cruiser atop the spacecraft had cold eyes as he stared at Lu Yin. “I’m sorry, but you can only blame your poor luck. Help us escape this calamity.” And with that, he loosed a ferocious attack from his palm, and an imprint traveled across space, heading straight towards Lu Yin’s personal spacecraft.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes went wide upon seeing this powerful attack, which carried a power level that should be over 80,000. He did not even think and immediately pointed the Money Bomb’s unsealed end towards the Cruiser. The star energy within it surged forth, and the next moment, a ray of light shot out. It directly pierced through the Cruiser’s enormous palm imprint before continuing on to directly strike the person himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That Cruiser never expected that this Limiteer would be able to unleash such a deadly attack even in his wildest dreams, and he had not even attempted to avoid it. When he looked down, he saw that his abdomen had been pierced through and knew that he would certainly perish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How had it ended up like this? He was an existence who dared to cross realms to challenge Hunters, and his true strength allowed him to challenge those whose power levels were over 100,000. And yet, he had ended up dying to a Limiteer.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had never imagined that the Money Bomb would be so ruthless and that just one ray of light would instantly kill a Cruiser. The man hadn’t been able to resist at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No wonder Old Cai had said that these boxes could even instantly wipe out a Hunter. This destructive force could indeed eliminate the average Hunter, so fifty star essence was actually a reasonable price for one of these boxes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Money Bomb could only be used once, and the metal ball inside would break after that one usage. The seals made of dark green bamboo would also have their color fade away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stored the used Money Bomb away and looked at the small spacecraft.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those in that small spacecraft were still staring at him in shock, their dead captain already having been engulfed by the storm long ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were not too far apart, and Lu Yin could clearly see their faces were filled with hatred and loathing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they soon had no time to bother with Lu Yin. The Money Bomb’s attack had not only dispatched the Cruiser, but also damaged the roof of the small spacecraft, which was now continuously trembling. It didn’t take long for the roof to start breaking down and the spacecraft to slow down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin felt no sympathy for them. If that Cruiser had not attacked him, then he would not have acted against them. These people were the kind to sacrifice others to ensure their own safety. Even if there had been no animosity between them before, their captain’s death could not pardon them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The small spacecraft gradually fell behind, and Lu Yin turned around to take back control of the spacecraft as the monkey merged back into his arm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the spacecraft quivered, and Lu Yin looked up. There was another person atop his spacecraft. Unexpectedly, there had been more than one Cruiser.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This person tightly held onto Lu Yin’s spacecraft, as a Cruiser’s speed was much slower than a radiant-grade spacecraft. This man intended to escape by tagging along with Lu Yin’s spacecraft.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, look! The storm is slowing down!” the monkey yelled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin turned around and saw that the storm was indeed diminishing. The small spacecraft behind him was right about to be engulfed by the storm. Even though it had not been swallowed yet, it still would not be able to escape before the storm completely dissipated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a rumble as the Cruiser atop Lu Yin’s Aurora slammed his palm against the roof, causing the spacecraft to slow down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was furious, as this person even wanted to use his spacecraft as a sacrifice in order to buy more time for their own small spacecraft to escape.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, slaughter him!” The monkey was also enraged.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin placed his palm against the spacecraft’s roof, and a dark-gold radiance emerged from his palm. With the addition of his battle force, Thirty Stacks loudly burst forth. The radiant-grade spacecraft was sturdy enough to withstand the Cruiser’s attack, but Lu Yin’s Thirty Stacks passed through the metal, the powerful vibration squarely striking the Cruiser.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Cruiser only felt the approach of an enormous strength, and he was almost unable to withstand it. His internal organs were painfully jostled about as he stared at the spacecraft in shock. A Limiteer actually possessed the strength to injure a Cruiser; there were not many such people in the entire universe. Since he had already ended up provoking such a person, he had to follow through and make sure that the person in this spacecraft did not survive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Through the roof of the Aurora, Lu Yin and that Cruiser traded blows. Eventually, the roof was unable to withstand the force of these Cruiser-level attacks, and a crack appeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, stop fighting! The spacecraft can’t take anymore,” the monkey warned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin felt helpless, as this opponent was not easily dealt with. After all, this person was a Cruiser with a power level of over 50,000.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The exchange of blows between the two caused the spacecraft to slow down considerably, and it was soon equal in position to the small spacecraft, before slowly falling behind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those in the small spacecraft relaxed. As long as Lu Yin’s spacecraft was swallowed, it would buy some more time for them, which would hopefully be enough for them to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That Cruiser panted heavily, and with one leap, he appeared on the roof of the small spacecraft. He looked at Lu Yin with an intense expression filled with fear and stress.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Limiteer who can take on a Cruiser.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;He could only think of a few names who was capable of this in the entire universe, and even if this person was not one of them, he would still become somebody of great influence in the future, not just some nameless nobody. Since he had provoked such a person, this Limiteer had to be killed. Otherwise, there would be no end to his troubles in the future.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything had happened too quickly, to the point where Lu Yin had not even found the opportunity to threaten his opponent with his many titles and high status. However, under such circumstances, such threats would hold no weight since it was a matter of exclusive survival. Even if the Ten Arbiters themselves took revenge for him, that would be a future matter. So in the case, Lu Yin’s status could not save him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crack atop Lu Yin’s spacecraft spread even more, and his spacecraft slowed down another notch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’re screwed! We’re going to be swallowed! Doomed! My Celestial Ice Phoenix Clan, my harem!” the monkey shouted in a grieving voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin clenched both of his fists and stared at the oncoming storm. He then gritted his teeth and turned to stare at the small spacecraft. He shattered his spacecraft’s roof with a single punch, and with the help of his spacecraft, used Flash to close in on the small spacecraft with his extreme speed. He then struck out with a palm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people within the small spacecraft were not bothered, as there was a Cruiser with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Cruiser watched Lu Yin’s palm attack and did not dare to be careless. He struck out with all his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Normally, it would not be easy for Lu Yin to deal with such a person due to the tremendous difference in their power levels. However, at this moment, something appeared in Lu Yin’s palm: Progenitor Wushang’s hide.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Cruiser saw it, his mind was ferociously scrambled, and he directly fainted without the slightest sign of resistance. This was the power of Progenitor Wushang. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s palm had never been intended to cause mutual destruction. Rather, he wanted to use this small spacecraft to escape. He casually kicked the Cruiser into the storm and watched as the storm devoured both his spacecraft and the Cruiser. He panted heavily, as the storm grew slightly smaller. He felt like he could actually escape.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, not everything always goes according to plan. His attack with the Money Bomb had damaged the small spacecraft too severely, and the roof was completely shattered, causing both the small spacecraft and Lu Yin to be swallowed by the storm next. The instant after, the universe turned silent once more, and the storm vanished without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Days later, in Astral-8, Feng Shang blankly watched the news from Tempest Flowzone and saw that a storm had emerged on that route. He immediately tried to call Lu Yin, as the emergence of the storm had occurred not long after Lu Yin had called.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he was unable to get in contact with Lu Yin.</span></p>
