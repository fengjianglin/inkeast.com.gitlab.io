She isn’t showing any signs of accepting you, and yet, she doesn't want you to like someone else. She is going overboard!” the monkey cried out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was Ming Yan really going overboard? Love was something that made people jealous, so anyone would have felt the same.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m sorry, Brother Lu. Let’s just pretend that I didn't say anything. I will give this matter some serious consideration,” Ming Yan quickly continued. She was also able to sense that she had gone too far with her words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin did not continue to dwell on this topic. He was a complete beginner when it came to love without any experience whatsoever, and Ming Yan was the same. The two of them spoke straight from their hearts with neither pretenses nor white lies. This was part of the reason why they had fallen in love with each other so quickly, but it was also the reason why their relationship had run into issues so easily. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shenwu Continent will join the rest of the universe in the future, and we’ll have a lot of time to spend together once that happens. Maybe I can take you and your father to visit my hometown and show you both around. You could give me your answer then,” Lu Yin offered gently. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Yan nodded. She had considered many things over the past few days. She hated that Lu Yin felt foreign to her and that she had rejected his advances, but she also could not be blamed as it had a subconscious reaction. She knew that she loved the man standing in front of her, but what was it that was stopping her from further developing this relationship? She did not have the answer to that at this time. She needed to think things through even if it meant that this man would end up with someone else while she did so.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Lu Yin did not say much during the two hours that he spent with Ming Yan, he still enjoyed the feeling of just having her by his side. Her familiar fragrance gave him a sense of calm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You should head back now, and don’t put too much pressure on yourself,” Lu Yin said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Yan made a sound of acknowledgement and bowed her head. It was impossible to know what she was thinking about.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s heart stirred, and he moved closer and slowly embraced her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Yan was shocked, but this time, she did not move away from him. She actually felt very safe in his arms. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sky grew dark very quickly, and Ming Yan returned home soon after.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin went to meet with Ming Zhaoshu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have confirmed with the people on the space station that we will attack the five sealing planets in five days,” Ming Zhaoshu informed Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded his head. “We will set out tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Zhaoshu knitted his brows. “We can actually wait longer than that. Things will be too rushed if you head out tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked at Ming Zhaoshu. “If this were a normal battle, then we could afford to wait. However, our opponent this time is the Neohuman Alliance. Delaying even another second only increases the possibility of a Corpse King appearing. When that happens, countless people will be turned into monsters. There are no strategies to deal with them, and if that happens, all we can do is fight our hardest.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Besides, do you really dare to delay things any longer? The people at the space station are already aware that the Neohuman Alliance is on the continent, and if we delay any longer, then it won’t just be the Neohuman Alliance that gets eradicated. Instead, it’ll be a concerted effort by the Outerverse’s combined might to destroy the entire continent.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Zhaoshu felt helpless. He was good at being patient for the right opportunity to strike. However, Lu Yin was obviously an impulsive person, or at least, that was how Ming Zhaoshu felt. The Reverent King felt that he was someone who could reduce casualties to the lowest level possible so long as he was given time. However, he was not the one in control right now. Besides, Lu Yin was not wrong either. He had not dared to expose the presence of the Neohuman Alliance out of fear that the people of the Outerverse would see the entire Shenwu Continent as an enemy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How are things with Yan’er?” Ming Zhaoshu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, before he could even finish speaking, Lu Yin interrupted him. “Things are fine between us, but let’s focus on this battle first.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Zhaoshu looked at Lu Yin’s back with a twinkle in his eye. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle in five days would lead to a new dawn for the continent. . &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After walking out of the Reverent King’s Residence, Lu Yin was in a rather good mood. His time with Ming Yan had allowed him to realize something: she still had feelings for him deep down inside. It was merely that the time that they had spent apart had caused them to become unfamiliar with each other. This had caused her to grow reticent, and she needed some time to adjust. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As long as her feelings for Lu Yin had not changed, the situation could still be salvaged. Was this what long-distance relationships were like? Being separated for two years was certainly a long-distance relationship. Lu Yin felt happy that he was close to her at this moment. If he had been forced to wait much longer, her feelings would probably have ceased to exist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only thing that he could blame was that they had not spent enough time together in the past. He had developed the false belief that their love was so deep that it could withstand the test of time. Alas, none of that mattered now since Shenwu Continent was no longer forbidden ground to him; instead, it had become a place that he could visit at any time. Aside from the initial culture shock, there probably wasn’t much that could surprise Ming Yan anymore. So long as they were both willing to start their relationship again, it was not too late. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She could treat it as though they were falling in love all over again. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next day, Lu Yin met up with Nightking Changfeng and the others inside of the valley. The others had turned up in full numbers. Lu Yin’s stellar performance during the battle the day before as well as his overwhelming presence had pressured them all into showing up. Even the usually unyielding Bigbeard did his best to avoid Lu Yin’s gaze. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin did not show them much courtesy, and he immediately took off to start their journey. He followed the same route that he had traveled with Arikar in the past as he headed for Mingdu. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the people behind him had stayed in Shenwu Continent for too long, their star energy had long since been replaced with martial power, so a heavenly globe wouldn’t be able to sense any abnormalities from them. However, just to be safe, Lu Yin led them along the long route. &nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the early morning of the fifth day, at the first light of dawn, Lu Yin assigned everyone a position and arranged them all in a manner to prevent the Corpse King from escaping. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before long, the sky trembled, and it felt like an earthquake was shaking the entire continent. Figure after figure took to the sky as the five sealing planets were under attack. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Shenwu Continent had been excommunicated by the Outerverse, the five sealing planets had not suffered any attacks in a long time. The Enlighters had all gone to the Ironblood Weave, and any attacks on the five sealing planets by Madam Meilan or the others were completely ineffective. In recent days, Shenwu Continent had been peaceful and serene, so nobody would have thought that an altercation would take place on such a day. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Zhaotian had a bitter look on his face; this attack out of nowhere had flustered him. He was worried about the Enlighters who had gathered in the Outerverse. Out of desperation, he issued notices throughout the entire Shenwu Continent, ordering all who had cultivated to the stage of Martial Emperor or higher to report to the five sealing planets. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He himself headed into the sky himself while leaving control of the empire to Crown Prince Ming Hao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Move out now!” Lu Yin bellowed. He had already donned the universal armor, leaped into the sky, and dived straight towards the Tower of Resonating Light. Everyone else scrambled to get into the positions they had been assigned by Lu Yin, and Nightking Changfeng was no exception. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were four peaks surrounding the capital, Mingdu, which had been protected by four Martial Sovereigns in the past. One of them had been lured away by Ming Zhaoshu to Qiong Island’s Shanhai city and another perished in battle, meaning that there were only two guardians left. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When these two people saw Lu Yin and the others show up, they immediately sprang into action.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of a sudden, skilled Martial Sovereigns appeared from all over inside Mingdu, and they held the two experts back. These people were subordinates of Ming Zhaoshu, as he was prepared to give it his all for this battle. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one expected that the rebels would attack at the same time that the five sealing planets were attacked. This was betraying the entire continent!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Hao was enraged and saddened at the same time. He was also worried that his secret hidden underground might be discovered. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Majesty, someone is moving towards the Tower of Resonating Light!” A Martial Emperor expert cried out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Hao’s expression changed drastically. “Stop them!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin raised his hands, and a single attack from each hand killed two Martial Emperor experts. He didn’t hesitate and continued to dash madly towards the Tower of Resonating Light. He shot down just like a meteor, not bothering to look for the entrance, and instead simply tunneled straight into the ground. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, the Tower of Resonating Light had trapped an entire group of trial takers, but now, all of the tower’s defenses were crumbling under his might. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In what felt like a mere moment, Lu Yin arrived at the lowest known level of the Tower of Resonating Light. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment Ming Zhaoshu had received Ming Taizhong’s inheritance, the threat of the Tower of Resonating Light had already been neutralized. The area had since become an experimental base for the Neohuman Alliance. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin saw many laboratories, a Corpse King, and various types of energy crystals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he was in the darkness underground, he could still see no less than a hundred thousand zombies roaming about. They were all ordinary humans who had been captured by the Neohuman Alliance for experimental purposes. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the Neohuman Alliance, a public enemy of the entire universe. As far as they were concerned, every organism was nothing more than a lab rat. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin released his domain, crushing the underground area. Whether it was the zombies or a Corpse King, everything moving instantly exploded. With a furious growl, a black figure suddenly charged towards Lu Yin, clearly enraged. Lu Yin made no attempt to evade the charge. Instead, he raised his palm and shouted as he released his own attack in response. “Thirty Stacks, One Hundredfold Shockwave Palm!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a resounding boom, the entire Tower of Resonating Light shattered, and sunshine appeared underground. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stood in place and did not move. The black figure slowly became visible; it was the powerful Cruiser Corpse King whose rune lines were comparable to Kong Shi’s.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was clear that this Corpse King was confused, but regardless, its physical strength was off the charts. Lu Yin’s attack didn’t seem to faze it at all. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With another angry yell, a metallic lustre appeared and covered the surface of the Corpse King’s body. It slashed its claws towards Lu Yin, and Lu Yin raised his brows. Was this an innate gift?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin struck out with another palm, and there was another thump as the impact caused another shockwave to ripple out, splitting all of Mingdu apart. Huge cracks started to spread out from the Tower of Resonating Light that traveled all the way to the imperial palace. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shock was shining in Ming Hao’s eyes. The aftershocks of the underground battle caused his heart to palpitate. He had had no idea that Ming Zhaoshu had subordinates who were this strong. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, battles erupted everywhere across the capital. Bigbeard was the first to encounter a Corpse King, which triggered an intense battle. Following that, the others also started facing off against zombies and Corpse Kings. As they fended off the Corpse Kings, they also had to deal with the cultivators of the Shenwu Empire. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Changfeng’s location wasn’t far away from the Demon Hunters Society, as that was the strategic location that Lu Yin had chosen for him. Beneath the ground in this area weren’t only Corpse Kings from the Neohuman Alliance, but also Lord Blackgown and several other skilled individuals who belonged to the Neohuman Alliance. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hua Ying, Bei Qing, and the others all attacked Nightking Changfeng. The Nightking responded with a cold snort and a wave of his arms, causing everyone to fall back. Hua Ying’s beauty had mesmerised him so much that he did not deal a deadly blow to the attackers, as if he had not held back, then a single attack from him would have been enough to kill them all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hua Ying had been beaten unconscious by Lu Yin just a few days ago. She had woken up with her comrades atop a tree and was still filled with anger from the incident. Coincidentally, since the capital was currently being attacked, regardless of how powerful the attackers were, she intended to vent some of her anger on them. Nightking Changfeng narrowed his eyes. “You should know your place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as he was about to attack again, the ground beneath him shattered, and a Corpse King rose up. It bellowed as it stretched out its claws towards Nightking Changfeng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was shocked to see a Corpse King here, but he immediately swayed to avoid it. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Astonished, Hua Ying stared at the monster that had suddenly appeared. She could not understand why such a monstrosity had been hiding underground. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, grains of black sand suddenly swept across the sky, casually travelling towards Nightking Changfeng. Lord Blackgown had arrived. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My Lord, there are monsters underground!” Hua Ying yelled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lord Blackgown swept past Hua Ying and the others as his blacksand formed into chains. Then, he rushed towards Nightking Changfeng. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Changfeng’s expression turned cold, and the surface of his body glistened like jade. Seven lined battle force burst forth as he struck out with his palm to attack. This attack repelled both the Corpse King and black-gowned lord, and the Corpse King ended up especially miserable as the attack had nearly caused its head to explode.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lord Blackgown snarled angrily, and he ripped off his robes to reveal his face to Hua Ying and the others for the first time. They all saw that he was also a monster with scarlet red eyes and that he was covered with blacksand from head to toe. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Another Corpse King!” Nightking Changfeng struck out with a palm once again. “Nightking palm!” This attack revealed intermingling black and white colors, and Lord Blackgown bellowed at the sky. The blacksand wrapped around his entire body, and he charged recklessly at Nightking Changfeng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The end result of the collision between the two shattered the surrounding streets, affecting countless people as the ground shattered. Hua Ying and the other Demon Hunters weren’t able to withstand the ripples of the aftershocks and tumbled backwards.</span></p>
