Two of the four unequaled Limiteers in the younger generation were finally clashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Michelle and the rest were also present and watching, and Lulu in particular was very excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Pao’s face was positively radiant since this battle was wholly unrelated to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the Sea King’s son-in-law selection that had taken place a few days before, he had urged Lulu to splurge and poach Ling Que’s cheerleaders. In the end, the girls had cheered for Mu Rong. After the selection, the entire matter should have ended.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que, however, seemed to have some screws loose in his head, and he was determined to retrieve his cheerleaders. According to him, when no one cheered for him, he was unable to get into the right mental state.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The problem was that the cheerleaders had become captivated by Mu Rong. Although they had been bought over by the allure of Ling Que’s money, they had coincidentally walked past Mu Rong and involuntary screams had sounded from the group that had startled both Mu Rong and Ling Que. What had added oil to the fire were the rumors that Ling Que could not compare to Mu Rong, so the current battle had been arranged in fury.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, the cheerleaders were caught in a dilemma. They liked both Ling Que and Mu Rong, so they were at a loss for who they should cheer on.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not interested in battling you,” Mu Rong calmly replied. It almost felt like he did not take any matter seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que snorted before replying, “So what? Are you trying to have your cake and eat it too? Don’t even bother thinking about it! During the selection, you secretly stole away my cheering squad, and I still haven’t settled that matter with you. If you hadn’t snatched them away, my mood wouldn’t have been as poor, and my mind wouldn’t have been in such a miserable state. I definitely wouldn’t have been ambushed by Cheng Wu otherwise. Everything’s because of you!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong frowned. “That’s ridiculous.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que was furious as well. “You’re still pretending! Today, my state is great, so I’ll show you the results of your pretending!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, Ling Que lifted his hand and raised it a few times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ling Que, Ling Que, I love you! Ling Que, Ling Que, you’re the best!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ling Que, Ling Que, I love you! Ling Que, Ling Que, you’re the best!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cheerleaders maintained their professional conduct; they had accepted Ling Que’s money, so they would only cheer for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surrounding people were shocked and hurriedly moved away from the group of lunatics.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que basked in the cheers as star energy erupted from his body and crushed the ground beneath him. Even the void shuddered as the surging energy was so strong that it pushed the air away, eventually blowing past the clouds in the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It looked like a smoke signal ascending to the heavens, and it attracted even more attention.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Lie, Che Han, the still undeparted Cheng Wu, Qin Chen, and the rest all came to watch. Even Lan Yu and Zhang Dingtian were present.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Ling Que erupting with all of his strength, and he was demonstrating the full terror of an unequaled Limiteer. Many felt that Cheng Wu’s ambush on Ling Que during the selection had been unfortunate, as Ling Que hadn’t even been able to display the Lingling clan’s inherited battle technique—the Soulsplitting Technique. They had been waiting for this moment to finally arrive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle prowess that Mu Rong had displayed in the selection was astounding, and even Cheng Wu had believed that it would be difficult for him to defeat Mu Rong. This peerless Limiteer still had hidden trump cards, and he was unfathomable to the extreme. Unfortunately, he had not clashed against Lu Yin, but many believed that Lu Yin was not Mu Rong’s opponent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a fellow user of Thirty Stacks who was even an Explorer, Lan Yu had been easily defeated by Mu Rong. Their battle seemed to prove that the Overlaying Stacks method was ineffective against Mu Rong, which insinuated that Lu Yin’s chances of victory were very low.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amongst the four unparalleled Limiteers, Mu Rong was believed to be the strongest since he had been publicly recognized by the Ten Arbiters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a whoosh, Ling Que dashed through the void with extreme speed as his Que's Mighty Slash appeared in his hand. He sliced out, and his movements were accompanied by a deafening crash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sudden clap of thunder rang out, and the air shattered as the thunder transformed into a visible shockwave that swept out across the flat ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong’s gaze was stern, as he could not be careless against Ling Que. The thunder and the shockwave swept forward together as one while Que’s Mighty Slash closed in on Mu Rong. The wooden flute spun around in his hand as he stepped to the side, easily dodging the Que's Mighty Slash. Then, he simply sidestepped once again to dodge the explosion of the thunder and the shockwave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lingling clan members were able to absorb others’ innate gifts and form their own everlasting innate gift. Ling Que’s Que's Mighty Slash possessed the strength of both thunder and sound, and it was rather terrifying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que sneered when he saw that not a single one of his strikes had landed. “Mu Rong, don’t assume that your Floating Stride that allows you to avoid and dissolve your opponent’s attacks, almost like a lockbreaking technique, is a secret or something. Additionally, even your Floating Stride has its limits!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que’s eyes flickered, and his entire body froze for a split second. The next moment, everyone stared at the battlefield as their faces turned to expressions of disbelief.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que had split in two.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the Soulsplitting Technique, the Lingling clan’s ancient inherited battle technique. No one knew whether the clan had existed for 100,000 years or a million years aside from the clan itself. During this time, numerous civilizations had risen and fallen in the universe, and multiple generations had passed. It was impossible to know if this clan had existed since ancient times, or if it had been established upon the ruins of a past great civilization.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Soulsplitting Technique had always been the Lingling clan’s most terrifying battle technique, and it intimidated outsiders the greatest. No one else could learn it aside from the Lingling clan’s own members.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the reason why Ling Que had been declared as an unequaled Limiteer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two Que's Mighty Slashes appeared and then vanished simultaneously, as regardless of how solid the void was here, it could not stop the Que's Mighty Slash from shuttling through it. This was just one of it’s terrifying aspects.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the selection, if Cheng Wu hadn’t taken the initiative to ambush Ling Que, heavily injuring him before he could retaliate in the process, then Ling Que may not have been so easily defeated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the universe, there were always these genius freaks that defied comprehension, and Ling Que ranked at the top among these freaks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Que's Mighty Slash was sufficiently powerful to cause countless people to feel numb, and most people would not even be able to react as both blades chopped down simultaneously. Everyone stared at the field, their breathing about to halt.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Michelle and the rest were also shocked. They were fellow Limiteers, but the disparity between them was too great.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong suddenly moved; he took one step forward with his right leg. There was obviously nothing in front of him, but then he suddenly shifted to the right, and in the next instant, Que's Mighty Slash appeared, streaking past along his neck and causing a trace of blood to appear. Mu Rong retreated right after that, and the second Que's Mighty Slash streaked past his forehead, leaving a similar thin line of blood there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two Que's Mighty Slashes had given Mu Rong two wounds.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que was astounded; his dual Que's Mighty Slashes had always successfully injured his enemies before. If he had not been injured by Cheng Wu’s ambush, then he was confident that even Cheng Wu would fall to this attack. However, it had only given Mu Rong a superficial injury.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong was slightly injured, but this was the first time he had been hit since arriving at the Sea King’s Dome to participate in the selection. It could be said that this was also his first time being injured during a battle against someone from the same generation as him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He touched his wound and felt its shallowness, but his expression turned serious nonetheless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beneath Mu Rong, dark green grass appeared, exuding an overflowing vitality, and in the surrounding void, the farmer boy riding on a cow appeared with a leisurely expression. This was Mu Rong’s personal forcefield, a vision of the farmer boy herding cattle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment the forcefield appeared, the two Que's Mighty Slashes were expelled from the void, and they moved back to revolve around the two Ling Ques. They could easily shuttle through the void, but they could not pass through Mu Rong’s forcefield, which meant that his Que's Mighty Slash’s strongest aspect had been nullified now that this forcefield had appeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que did not think that Mu Rong’s forcefield would have such a large restraining effect on him. If Cheng Wu had tried to control Ling Que through that invulnerable clock, then Mu Rong’s method was to cut off his blades’ greatest advantage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t just Ling Que, as the entire audience had been enveloped by Mu Rong’s forcefield as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Michelle felt the forcefield oppress her entire body, and she even found it hard to circulate her star energy. The moment she was enveloped by the forcefield, her power had dropped by two-thirds, leaving her dumbstruck. This powerful forcefield had shattered her previous understanding of domains.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lulu clenched her fists; her physical strength was still there, but it was also being suppressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Luo had a look of amazement, and he looked up to see the famer boy herding cattle through the void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Darkvoid raised a hand, only to discover that his innate gift was useless as it had been completely suppressed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hui Daynight felt his scalp turn numb, as the feeling this forcefield gave him was too scary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone could sense the terror of Mu Rong’s forcefield, as experiencing it for themselves was completely different from merely seeing it. At this moment, they truly understood the reason why Zhang Dingtian had been defeated. This was an irresistible strength, and even Northgate Lie and Qin Chen had to admit that they would be defeated without question if they were suppressed within this forcefield.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cheng Wu had exchanged blows with Mu Rong and experienced this forcefield before, but he was still shocked. Once Mu Rong broke through and became an Explorer, a great number of the experts in the Top 100 Rankings would have to take a step back. This was a true unequaled Limiteer; he was not just unequaled in his generation, but rather invincible among all the Limiteers in the universe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The shock that Ling Que had given the onlookers simply crumbled away after Mu Rong’s forcefield enveloped them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong raised a hand and pressed downwards, prompting the farmer boy who was originally wandering around to directly rush towards Ling Que. The farmer boy represented the entire forcefield, and Ling Que felt as if the heavens themselves were collapsing upon him. Even the surrounding void was no longer stable, as distortions had appeared everywhere. Ling Que’s star energy was completely suppressed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que growled, and his doppelgangers vanished as they merged back into one body. Then, his body momentarily stopped moving once again. Under the alarmed gazes of everyone present, he split into—three bodies. Three Ling Ques appeared with three Que's Mighty Slashes revolving around them, and they all clashed with the farmer boy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone felt their minds being thrown into chaos, and many seemed to have been struck by an invisible attack and were forced to spit out blood. Many audience members even started bleeding from their seven orifices before fainting on the spot.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This collision between the two Limiteers even caused the void to start rumbling. This was because Mu Rong’s suppressive forcefield had already enveloped the void while Ling Que was displaying his Soulsplitting Technique to its extreme, and he was using the combined force of all three bodies to withstand Mu Rong’s forcefield.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ground flaked apart in layers as a terrifying aftershock rippled outwards. The avalanche of crushed rocks injured countless people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Luo and the rest were also within the scope of this aftershock. The youths all worked together, but Michelle and the others were still blown back by just an aftershock from the battle from Mu Rong and Ling Que.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surrounding void was suppressed, and unless someone with a power level that surpassed a Hunter’s attacked, the void would forever remain solid here. Even so, the ripples distorted the nearby space, causing all objects within a radius of 10,000 meters to disintegrate, including the nearby cliff.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the sky, Hai Dashao and Starsibyl stood far above everything as they looked down, watching the fight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And high above the entire Sea King’s Dome, even the Sea King was observing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This battle between Limiteers could even attract the Sea King’s attention; this was something that even a Top 100 Rankings expert might not be able to accomplish.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the dust settled, the onlookers who were still conscious all looked over in shock. Mu Rong was standing in his original place with a calm look while the three Ling Ques were panting heavily. They had managed to withstand a single strike from Mu Rong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cheerleaders had all fainted by now, but Ling Que could not be bothered with them at this moment. The three Ling Ques howled with laughter, in sync. “Mu Rong, you’re indeed powerful, but so what? No matter how powerful your forcefield may be, it cannot last forever! That strike should be your peak strength. Now, it’s my turn!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, the three Ling Ques stood in a triangular formation that surrounded Mu Rong. The three Que's Mighty Slashes released a sharp aura that warped the void. Not all ten of the innate gifts that made up Que’s Mighty Slash had been used by Ling Que in his fight. He felt that this was the right moment, and he merged all three blades into one. No one could withstand this attack, as he had once used this blade to defeat a Cruiser whose power level surpassed 70,000.</span></p>
