Before, he had only been able to observe the stars through his eyes, but now, he was able to use his domain, the Yu Secret Art, and his ability to see runes lines to help himself practice. With his enhanced understanding of the universe, he had managed to raise his Cosmic Art’s level to twenty stars in just ten days.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He currently had twenty-nine stars revolving around him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Cosmic Art had finally become useful to him once again. Lu Yin was elated as this was the first skill that he had ever learned, and it helped him increase his cultivation speed quite impressively as well. With the Cosmic Art, his domain, as well as his lockbreaking tools, he was now able to easily use the Secret Sidestep Technique, and he could also use this Cosmic Art to learn his opponent’s battle technique.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, he had only managed to cultivate the technique to nine stars, which hadn’t been very useful for imitating the techniques of other powerhouses. However, if he could reach ninety-nine stars, then this cultivation technique might become a very useful skill once again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His current plan was to cultivate the technique to ninety nine stars, which would greatly increase his current strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After ten days passed, it was the appointed time for Lu Yin to meet with Mr. Bai and the fatty again. Lu Yin informed Wendy Yushan, and then he sat down on his futon in King Zishan’s palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scenery before his eyes changed, and when he was finally able to clearly see his surroundings, he saw that he had come back to the ruined plaza. It looked the same as before; apart from the cracked ground and countless bone piles, he saw that there were a few more people near him. They didn’t talk to each other as they all immediately headed towards First Divine Gate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin took a look at his surroundings and wondered,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Where’s Wendy?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He released his domain and extended its range.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once he spread his domain, he felt someone fighting against it. In the distance, a girl opened her eyes and looked at Lu Yin with cold eyes as her domain aggressively pushed back against Lu Yin’s.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin frowned and crushed her domain in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a whoosh as a gale swept across the plaza. A few people looked over in shock, as the collision between the domains had caused an enormous crack to appear in the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl narrowed her eyes. Then, her domain suddenly disappeared as she leaped towards Lu Yin and attacked him. He was surprised by her actions since he had not expected her to be rash enough to try to fight him after her domain was destroyed. He promptly retaliated as twenty nine stars appeared around his body. The girl’s movements slowed down in his vision, and he easily dodged her attack before grabbing her arm and shoving her away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl flipped about in the air and glanced at Lu Yin in surprise. A unique mark appeared behind her, and she rushed towards Lu Yin again, ready to swat down at him with a hand. This attack was almost twice as powerful as her previous attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was astounded, as she was clearly using the exact same battle technique as before, but it had become much more powerful. What was that mark behind her? The cultivators from the Sixth Mainland had many strange techniques, but even after her attack was boosted, the girl still wasn’t his opponent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin used just one hand to block the girl’s attack before again shoving her away with his immense strength. The girl gritted her teeth and bellowed as a vague silhouette appeared behind her. She had now activated her imprint. She used the same attack yet again, but with a much stronger power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had used the exact same attack thrice now, but the power of her technique increased with every try. Her first attack had a power comparable to Northgate Lie’s, who was at the very bottom of the Top 100 Rankings. For her second attempt, her power had been comparable to people like the Faceless Man and Cheng Wu, who were ranked around sixty on the Top 100 Rankings. As for the third attempt, her power had exceeded Zhanbing Daynight’s and reached the standard of someone in the top fifty of the Top 100 Rankings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This showed the standard of the cultivators from the Sixth Mainland, and they were generally much stronger than the cultivators of the Fifth Mainland. Most of the people whom Lu Yin had met in the Daosource Sect were comparable to this girl.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin used his full power and withstood the girl’s attack with just one hand. He then grabbed her arm and pushed her away once again, this time using Overlaying Stacks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl landed heavily, leaving two deep footprints in the ground. Furthermore, Lu Yin’s counter that had been powered up with Overlaying Stacks had forced her into a hasty retreat. Eventually, she fell to the ground as a strand of blood leaked out from the edge of her mouth. She looked at Lu Yin in surprise. “You!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin glanced at her coldly. She was much weaker than the man who he had killed during his last visit to this place. That man had been comparable to Nightking Gu whereas this girl would only reach around fortieth in the Top 100 Rankings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl spat out a mouthful of blood and her face became very pale. She glared at Lu Yin while showing her reluctance. “Who are you? What’s your name?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin didn’t answer, as he had the identity of a deaf and mute person in this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl continued, shouting, “Don’t you even dare to tell me your name?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin raised his head and unleashed his domain to continue looking for Wendy Yushan. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl grew furious. “Remember me! My name is Tong Tong, and I’m the younger sister of Tong Zhan from the Grand Martial Realm. I will never forget this!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin frowned and glared at Tong Tong while killing intent flashed through his eyes. This woman was crazy! She actually dared to threaten him in this situation?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tong Tong smirked when she saw Lu Yin’s expression. “You want to kill me? That’s impossible. I have lots of power vessels, and even an Enlighter wouldn’t be able to kill me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes narrowed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, Mr. Bai appeared in the plaza, and he immediately noticed Lu Yin’s confrontation with Tong Tong. He stood up and walked towards Lu Yin while gesturing at him.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai then turned to look at Tong Tong. “Was there some sort of misunderstanding between you and my friend?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tong Tong snorted and kept glaring at Lu Yin. “You better remember me! And don’t let me bump into you in the Daosource Sect!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She then walked away.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin shook his head. He pointed at Tong Tong and then his brain, which carried a clear meaning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tong Tong had turned back coincidentally at that moment and was outraged when she saw his actions. “Just you wait!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It would appear that she is a rather troublesome young lady.” Mr. Bai smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin still hadn’t found Wendy Yushan and was worried that she might have encountered some mishap. He reluctantly asked, “My friend was supposed to come together with me, but she isn’t here. Why would that happen?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai smiled, but he didn’t seem surprised that Lu Yin was able to speak. “There are four main gates in the Daosource Sect and each gate has its own plaza. Your friend should be in another plaza.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin recalled the four gates: First Divine Gate, Second Supreme Gate, Third Azure Gate, and Fourth Imperial Gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who was that young lady just now?” Mr. Bai asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin answered, “The sister of Tong Zhan from the Grand Martial Realm.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tong Zhan? Well, you’ve offended someone quite important!” Mr. Bai laughed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin didn’t probe any further as he could tell from this response that Tong Zhan was quite famous. Thus, people would grow suspicious if Lu Yin asked about him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s wait here for a bit longer. Miss Qing and Fatty Bro should also be here soon. I’m quite curious about Fat Bro’s Sky-Eater Pig bloodline, and I wonder what happened to him,” Mr. Bai said calmly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded and quietly waited there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">More people appeared in the plaza from time to time, and a few groups of people had already entered First Divine Gate. Lu Yin’s eyes were gleaming. This place was clearly the ruins of the Fifth Mainland’s Daosource Sect, but the Fifth Mainland only possessed a few futons. Conversely, the Sixth Mainland had managed to acquire quite a lot of the futons. The Fifth Mainland had clearly suffered a crushing defeat in the ancient war.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I heard that the first batch of people invading the Fifth Mainland have already started fighting and have even reached the Mara River. Once they have completely suppressed the Fifth Mainland, the younger generation will then be able to join the battlefield, which will likely happen soon.” He turned to look at Lu Yin. “Perhaps we will be able to meet on the battlefield as well.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Possibly,” Lu Yin answered.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meet on the battlefield? If the Sixth Mainland invades the Outerverse, then it’s a definite possibility!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin didn’t have high hopes that the Fifth Mainland would be able to stop the Sixth Mainland’s attack as he observed the various cultivators from the Sixth Mainland. Most of the cultivators whom he had encountered were comparable to people on the Top 100 Rankings from his universe, and the average power of their cultivators was much higher than the Fifth Mainland’s. Moreover, the Sixth Mainland also had Progenitor level powerhouses, and Lu Yin couldn’t help but wonder how long his universe would be able to defend against such powerhouses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moments later, the fatty arrived, and he rushed over as soon as he saw Lu Yin and Mr. Bai. “Haha! I knew that you would be here.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai smiled. “Fat Bro, how is your Sky-Eater Pig bloodline?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty was thrilled. “It’s really powerful! My power has more than doubled, and I can even fight against Autumnfrost Qing now. That’s the confidence that comes from having an invincible bloodline.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai laughed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty looked at Lu Yin and gesticulated excitedly, which left Lu Yin speechless. This fatty must have invented this sign language himself, but Lu Yin couldn’t understand anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin didn’t reply, and Mr. Bai didn’t expose him either. The fatty continued to gesture exuberantly, and it seemed that he would only stop after getting some kind of response from Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin reluctantly gave him a thumbs up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang San grinned and then continued eagerly gesturing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, Miss Qing appeared at this time, which caused the fatty to finally stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang San was still very excited as he hadn’t actually expected the three of them to show up after a month, particularly since he was much less powerful than the three of them. Hence, he felt that he had finally made some true friends. He was especially grateful to Lu Yin as the fatty had shared all of his secrets with him, not to mention the fact that Lu Yin was the best person for the fatty to rant about his life. Thus, Huang San really didn’t want to lose these people as friends. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fatty, show me what the Sky-Eater Pig can do,” Miss Qing requested curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Please add the word bloodline. It’s the Sky-Eater Pig <em>bloodline</em>,” the fatty muttered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four of them walked through First Divine Gate and saw a guardian wandering about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang San clenched his fists. “Take a good look!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After so many years of being oppressed by others, he was desperate to earn their approval. His aim wasn’t to be able to fight a genius like Autumnfrost Qing, but he wished to at least become as powerful as Yan Xiaojing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty rushed at the First Divine Gate Guardian, and the automaton punched at its attacker as soon as it discovered him. A month ago, the fatty had needed both his imprint and battle technique to defeat a guardian. However, this time, the fatty didn’t bother activating his imprint. His body merely expanded slightly as an invisible outline enveloped his body that quickly formed into an enormous Sky-Eater Pig. The Sky-Eater Pig roared and bit down upon the guardian.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under Lu Yin, Miss Qing, and Mr. Bai’s surprised gazes, the outline of the Sky-Eater Pig bit off the guardian’s arm. It then bashed into the chest of the guardian, causing the thing to fly off into the distance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The broken arm fell to the ground. Huang San returned to his normal appearance, and then he raised his head to the sky and roared excitedly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What an aggressive method. He just went ahead and bit the thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Miss Qing placed her hands over her mouth. “His teeth are really hard.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The First Divine Gate Guardians had extremely solid casings since they were used to test aspiring disciples. In Lu Yin’s opinion, even the bottom few powerhouses in the Top 100 Rankings wouldn’t be able to defeat a single guardian by themselves. In the past, this fatty had only been able to barely defeat one guardian, but now, he was able to easily defeat one without even using his imprint.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This showed the power of bloodlines.</span></p>
