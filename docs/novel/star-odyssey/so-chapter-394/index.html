The most exciting news was about the invisible attacks from the pikes, as they were definitely exceptional.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many also knew that Lu Yin had obtained three pikes, so they were not surprised at his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Kong smiled. “Little kid, speaking too much isn’t good for you. Or, are you waiting for someone to take you away? You’re looking down too much on my Northgate family.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stoically replied, “Northgate Elder, I’m very curious about one thing. Although the pikes have an attack that seems to target one’s spiritual force, it’s only effective on the weak. You can ask Northgate Lie behind you; he was able to avoid its attacks. Such a thing isn’t of much use to your Northgate family.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t have to worry about whether or not it’s useful. Hand it over!” Northgate Lie shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin sighed. “I’m sorry Northgate Elder, but you’re too late. I’m keeping one pike, and I already intend on giving the other two to specific people.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Kong’s face sank. “Kid, don’t be too arrogant. Although your status might be a thorny issue, it’s still not enough to render us helpless. It’s naive to think that you can peacefully walk everywhere in the universe just through status.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s status could cause those in the Outerverse to be apprehensive, but it had not yet reached a level where it could restrain the great powers of the Innerverse. When benefits reached a certain level, one had to weigh the pros and cons. For the Northgate family, the ancient objects in the centipede's body were extremely valuable, enough to warrant even offending the Lockbreaker Society and the Ten Arbiters Council. As long as Northgate Taisui was around, they were not afraid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ten Arbiters Council would not clash with an old monster whose power level had reached hundreds of thousands just over a single Lu Yin. Even if Lu Yin died, someone would just cover up the truth as long as both sides could accept things. The Northgate family would merely have to pay some recompense to settle the matter, and it would be the same with the Lockbreaker Society.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rules in the universe appeared to be fair, but some people would always be above such laws; it would only matter if it was worth it to do so.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Normally, no one would break the rules for a conflict within the younger generation, but things were different now. The pikes had survived through ancient times, and the Northgate family had to get a hold of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin raised his gadget and activated the screen. “Elder Northgate, the identity of the person who I want to present my gift to is rather sensitive. Why don’t you talk with him?” An elder appeared on the screen with black-and-white long hair mixed with a lock of grey. This was a symbol of the Nightking clan, and this person was one of the clan’s elders: Nightking Yuanjing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Recently, the Daynight clan had been keeping a low profile. This was because they were focused on the Astral Beast Domain and attempting to rescue the Third Nightking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s initial information had been accurate, and they had indeed found the entrance to the Profound Void Realm. However, things were not that simple. Before they even entered that realm, they had realized that it would be extremely difficult to rescue the Third Nightking, as they had already run into all sorts of dangers. This matter gave Nightking Yuanjing and the rest a splitting headache. He had already been planning on contacting Lu Yin, even though he knew that Lu Yin really didn’t know much. Still, he held some expectations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, before he could even try to reach out to Lu Yin, the youth had contacted him first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing was delighted when he saw Lu Yin. “Little Yin, where did you find the time to contact Grandpa Yuanjing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing’s appearance shocked Northgate Kong and the rest, and even Northgate Taisui looked over. The Nightking clan was not a group that their Northline Flowzone could provoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many felt their hearts jump. Didn’t Lu Yin have some kind of grudge with the Daynight clan? How did he have the contact information of someone in the Nightking clan?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was also elated to see Nightking Yuanjing. “Grandpa Yuanjing, Little Yin obtained three pikes from an ancient centipede's body, and I was planning on sending one of the pikes to Zhuo Daynight, but I wasn’t able to contact her. Does Grandpa Yuanjing know where she is?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing’s eyes lit up. “An ancient centipede's body? Little Yin, where’s this ancient centipede's body?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin directed his gadget to a place in the distance, and the giant centipede's body entered Nightking Yuanjing’s screen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was surprised. “It’s really an ancient centipede's body!” Then, when he caught sight of Northgate Taisui, his eyes suddenly shrank, and he fell silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Taisui looked at the image of Nightking Yuanjing, and the distorted void around him regained its normalcy. Now, everyone could see the face of an ordinary elder.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing was hesitant when he saw Northgate Taisui on his screen. “You look very familiar.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Taisui said in an old voice, “So it’s an expert of the Nightking clan. You haven’t appeared in a long time.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing’s eyes flickered, and astonishment appeared on his face. “Northgate Taisui.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Taisui laughed. “You’re rather experienced for you to be able to recognize me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing exclaimed, “It’s rumored that Senior Northgate Taisui only planned to emerge after breaking through and that he has not appeared for many years. I never thought that I would one day have the honor of meeting senior.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Taisui shook his head and forced a smile onto his face. “I’m just an old man, nothing to be excited over meeting.” He then glanced at Lu Yin. “Kid, you’re pretty capable since you’ve brought out the Nightking clan. My Northgate family isn’t greedy, so you can keep one for yourself and gift the other to the Daynight clan. My Northgate family will buy the last one after you decide upon the price. How does that sound?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing looked at Lu Yin, and he was no fool, either. He knew full well that Lu Yin had used him to avoid a disaster, but he did not mind that. This was the prestige of the Nightking clan; even an old freak with a power level in the hundreds of thousands had to show the Nightking clan some respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, they had also obtained a pike for themselves.</span></p>

Also, the centipede's body was not something that the Northline Flowzone could monopolize.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin relaxed, as his gamble had paid off; Northgate Taisui was also cautious of the Nightking clan. Lu Yin did not know if he should be delighted or worried, as the Nightking clan was way too overbearing. It would be very troublesome to be hostile with them, but he had already taken many steps towards being their enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, Lu Yin’s emotions were very complicated. He had dragged Nightking Yuanjing out, causing the Northgate family to be afraid. He had accomplished his goals, but the Nightking clan was just too powerful, which caused him to worry about his future.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this was not time to ponder over such things. He pulled out a pike and generously tossed it towards Northgate Kong. “Since senior has spoken, this junior has no reason not to comply.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corners of Northgate Kong’s mouth curled up. Why hadn’t this kid been this obedient a moment ago?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Lie’s face sank, as this person’s nature had completely changed. Someone who was just a puny Limiteer cultivator had managed to seize the initiative and even force their ancestor to personally speak up. The whole matter was too humiliating for their family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked at Nightking Yuanjing. “Grandpa Yuanjing, one of the other pikes is for Zhuo Daynight. Do you know where she is?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing smiled. “That brat has a wild temper, so I’m not sure myself. Why don’t you keep it for now? You can personally give it to her during the Daynight Feast.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was confused. “The Daynight Feast?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing smiled. “It’s an event organized by my Nightking clan. It’s a grand party for the younger generation where they can interact and learn from each other. Zhenwu will also be present, Little Yin, and you can speak to him then. After all, you’re all top elites of the younger generation.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes flashed; even Arbiter Zhenwu would be at the Daynight Feast?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could not decline, as this could be considered an invitation from Nightking Yuanjing, so he could not embarrass the Nightking Elder. However, he was a little apprehensive about visiting the Nightking clan, and concerns of being assassinated leaped into his mind. With the Nightking clan’s might, no one would dare to raise any suspicions even if Lu Yin died. No, he had to think of another way. Highsage Leon could protect him, but Lu Yin did not want to reveal his relationship with the Pirate King, as that would destroy his reputation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He ended his call with Nightking Yuanjing and turned to Northgate Kong with a smile. “Elder Northgate, how much is the Northgate family willing to pay for this pike?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Kong looked at the pike in the youth’s hand, and although he could not tell what the material it was made out of, there was a sharp, invisible energy around the ancient weapon. The aura could target an enemy’s spiritual force, though its effect was not that great. At best, it could deal with an ordinary Explorer, as an elite Explorer would be able to completely avoid the attack. There was nothing written on the pike, so it was not as valuable as the Northgate family had anticipated. It was no wonder why this brat was being so upfront about things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Lu, how much do you want?” Northgate Lie spoke up, as it was not appropriate for Northgate Kong to negotiate with a junior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin thought about it. “How much can you guys pay?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How much do you want?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’ll give me however much I want?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That depends on whether or not it’s worth it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then isn’t that the simplest way? Just tell me how much it’s worth.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Lie grew irritated. He was an expert on the Top 100 Rankings, but he was haggling with a money-pincher now. It was very awkward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Kong tossed a cosmic ring to Lu Yin. “There’s a hundred star essence in there. That should be enough.” After that, he turned around and left without looking back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s breathing grew a bit ragged. A hundred star essence! He hadn’t ever seen so much money before. Combined with the amount that he had earned while within the centipede's body, as well as what he had from before, his total wealth currently amounted to about 150 star essence! If he exchanged this to star crystals, it would be worth about 15 million cubes, which was a rather substantial sum. It was to the extent where the money would burn a hole in his pocket.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That pike was definitely not worth that much, but Northgate Kong did not want his family to keep bickering with Lu Yin. He now realized that Lu Yin had gone to such lengths purely because he did not want to be threatened and did not want to set a precedent for the future. His Northgate family had been used as a stepping stone! They had severely miscalculated for them to have fallen into such a trap.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had only wanted to show this effect, where even a powerful old freak would not be able to threaten him. Now, anyone else who wanted to act against him would have to first open their eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, this matter had also created a bit of animosity between him and the Northgate family. It would now be a bit difficult for him to smoothly gain control of the Northline Flowzone’s younger generation. That was, unless he openly defeated Northgate Lie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked up and coincidentally exchanged glances with Northgate Lie. Northgate Lie now seemed to hold a grudge against Lu Yin. If the Northgate youth had managed to seize the pikes in the centipede's body, then this fiasco would not have happened. Even Northgate Taisui had appeared on the Northgate family’s side, but he had not even been able to threaten a junior. It was just too embarrassing, and his family would blame everything squarely on Northgate Lie’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Lu, we’ll meet again at the Daynight Feast. I would like to learn from Brother Lu’s moves at that time,” Northgate Lie said coldly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin smiled. “Alright. Then, until we meet again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Taisui removed the spatial seal and allowed everyone to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many were still amazed at what they had just seen and cast admiring looks at Lu Yin. The youth had guts, and not even Northgate Taisui had been able to intimidate him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jared was even more shocked by Lu Yin upon seeing the final conclusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Chen seriously sized Lu Yin up and down and then left. He would appear at the Daynight Feast as well, so they would definitely meet again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was another matter that was more awkward, as many people were left without a spacecraft, including the many Limiteers who had been captured by the Northgate family. Almost all the spacecraft had been destroyed, and now, everyone was looking for one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was fine, though, since Lily Anne had contacted him at first opportunity and gifted him a spacecraft to show her goodwill.</span></p>
