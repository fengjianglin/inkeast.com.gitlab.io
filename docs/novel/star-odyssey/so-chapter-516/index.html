That brat’s headed towards Pyrolyte Lake! Hurry and send a message!”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Wen Qian'er was in the middle of Pyrolyte Lake, and when she looked up, the words in the sky gave her a strange feeling. The family was sending them a warning?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Given Lu Yin’s speed, as long as he was not delayed, it would only take him twenty minutes at most to reach Pyrolyte Lake. This was unlike the time when he had brought Hai Qiqi and taken several days to walk over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only did the Wen family warn their ground forces through writing in the sky, they even sent Limiteers down to Planet Pyrolyte.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Wen Qian'er and the others learned that Lu Yin was charging towards them, all of their hearts sank. Who on this entire planet could stand up to that guy?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que subconsciously wanted to run, but he was stopped by Wen Qian'er, who insisted that their guardian not leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They could not give up Pyrolyte Lake, as this was one of the largest pyrolyte mines on Planet Pyrolyte.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que felt miserable, as he could not disobey Wen Qian'er. Thus, he could only hope that Lu Yin would not be irrational.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was also afraid that Ling Que would slip away, as based on his understanding of Ling Que’s personality, this was very likely to happen. Hence, he had continuously increased his speed and had even unsealed the three grains of Fatesand around his body to use Flash to travel even faster. Finally, he arrived at Pyrolyte Lake, where he saw Ling Que and the others waiting for him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lu Yin, what do you want?” Ling Que put on a bold front.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin raised his fist. “To reaffirm my beliefs.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que’s mouth fell wide. “You came here to search for self-confidence?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin did not deny it. He raised his hand and immediately pressed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que’s face changed. “You’re too overbearing!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He immediately used the Soulsplitting Technique as three Ling Que launched their Que's Mighty Slashes in unison. Three merged back into one that crashed towards Lu Yin’s palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a boom as Pyrolyte Lake vanished; Lu Yin’s palm had evaporated the entire lake, crushed the three Que's Mighty Slashes, and also sent Ling Que flying into the bottom of Pyrolyte Lake in one blow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qian'er and the rest were stunned. Was the disparity between Ling Que and Lu Yin this large?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, Ling Que and Lu Yin had not truly confronted one another before this moment. At the base of the mountain range, Ling Que had retreated after receiving just one palm from Lu Yin, leaving the battle unresolved. On the other hand, Mu Rong had fought against Lu Yin for quite a while before the outcome had been decided. Hence, the various people had always assumed that the disparity between these three people was not that great, as they were still two of the top four Limiteers. However, everyone now truly understood the difference between the two.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que himself was also able to finally recognize this gap. He could tell that all of his bones had fractured, since this strike had not been gentle in the slightest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin pulled back his hand, but he didn’t turn around to head back towards the mountain range. Instead, he began moving towards Pyrolyte Mountain. Mu Rong was next.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He hadn’t unleashed all his strength against Mu Rong before, and he had at most unsealed two grains of Fatesand to break free of the farmer boy’s song, which had led to people having a misconception of Lu Yin’s full strength before this day. Ze Lin was the one who was most clear on his full strength, and Lu Yin wanted to set things straight for Mu Rong at this time. This would also help him reaffirm his belief that he was invincible, which would help him break through to six-lined battle force, which would allow him to become even stronger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At Pyrolyte Lake, Wen Qian'er and the others quickly relaxed. Everything was fine so long as Lu Yin did not seize the pyrolyte mine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qian’er immediately arranged for a spacecraft to take Ling Que to the Wen family’s battleship to recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que felt aggrieved. “I told you earlier to let me go, but you insisted on stopping me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qian'er apologized profusely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que sighed. “That freak! But everything’s still alright. From the direction he ran off in, Mu Rong will be the next one to run out of luck. At least it can’t always be me, keke.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Above the planet, Wen Qichen’s face grew even uglier, as she knew that Lu Yin was attempting a breakthrough. Although she did not know in what aspect, breaking through always represented an increase in power, and that would be troublesome since this Limiteer had already left them all feeling helpless before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other powers finally began to understand Lu Yin’s intentions as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sword Sect quickly used their spacecraft to form words, warning Mu Rong and Liu Shaoqiu to retreat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, neither of them left Pyrolyte Mountain, as retreating would mean that they were afraid, which went against their convictions. If they retreated, then Lu Yin would become a massive stone gate forever standing over their heads.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Yōu Court’s cultivators tried to persuade Yōu Ye'er to leave, but she wouldn’t leave either. She was very curious about Lu Yin as his body always carried this aura that attracted her, but she didn’t know what it was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, she was not afraid either. If possible, she also wanted to experience Lu Yin with her full strength and see who was the true invincible Limiteer. Could this person beat the Yōu Court’s Secret Art? The so-called strongest Limiteer didn’t include the Limiteers from the Three Dark Hands or the Neoverse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sky rippled, and a stifling pressure descended. Near Pyrolyte Mountain, the Sword Sect, Yōu Court, and a few secret observers felt their breaths inadvertently grow sluggish. When they looked up, they saw that Lu Yin had already appeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong spun the wooden flute in his hands with a solemn expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu stepped forward and unleashed his forcefield, instantly attacking with the Fourth Sword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wanted to use the Fifth Sword to defend against Lu Yin, but the simple fact was that he had not reached that level of proficiency and could only display the Fourth Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The forcefield converged into an endless rain of sword qi that sliced down, and space itself seemed to boil as the limitless sharp energy tore the void apart and caused cracks to appear everywhere. Lu Yin raised his head and stood in place. He then raised his right hand into the air and actually grabbed the sword qi while unleashing his strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under everyone’s stunned eyes, Liu Shaoqiu’s Fourth Sword was directly crushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if everyone had already known that Liu Shaoqiu would lose, they had not imagined that his loss would be so tragic. He had not even been able to force Lu Yin to take a single step back. He hadn’t even been able to force Lu Yin to become serious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span>, Liu Sanjian, and the other Sword Sect’s experts all had ugly expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment the Fourth Sword had collapsed, fresh blood flowed from Liu Shaoqiu’s lips. He had been injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong raised his wooden flute, causing green grass to appear and cover both the ground and the void. The farmer boy’s song rang out, and the farmer boy rushed at Lu Yin with his cow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It could be said that, when Lu Yin unsealed two grains of Fatesand, the farmer boy’s song could still influence him a little and he needed to exert some amount of force to break free from the song. However, at this moment, he had removed all three grains of Fatesand and had completely released his physical strength. The farmer boy’s song was just a song that only made others feel peaceful; it had no influence on Lu Yin whatsoever. The image of the farmer boy herding cattle was similarly casually swatted away by his right hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a bounce, Mu Rong slammed into the ground. Although Lu Yin’s palm strike had not been released against Mu Rong himself, its force had still shattered the forcefield, so Mu Rong had been indirectly attacked, much like Liu Shaoqiu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yōu Ye'er frowned, as Lu Yin was indeed very powerful. Mu Rong’s strength was top-notch even when compared to those in the Neoverse, but he had not been able to receive even a single palm from this person. This Lu Yin was stronger than what she previously estimated him to be.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin did not move a single step to defeat both Mu Rong and Liu Shaoqiu. He had only raised his right arm, and this singular move allowed everyone to keenly sense the disparity between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were all shocked at Lu Yin’s strength, but Lu Yin himself still was not satisfied. These two had not managed to reinforce his confidence enough to break through to six-lined battle force, and his spirit was still slightly lacking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, a spacecraft shot down from space on a path aimed straight for Pyrolyte Mountain. Lu Yin’s eyes filled with star energy as he observed the ship. He could see a majestic amount of rune lines, which even surpassed Ze Lin’s. Through these runes, Lu Yin could tell that the person descending was almost definitely Long Yun, a Sword Sect expert who had appeared as a trial taker on Shenwu Continent in the past. Long Yun’s actions there had allowed the Neohuman Alliance’s Wu Shang to escape, and his presence had also prevented Crown Prince Ming Hao from directly acting against those who had been trapped within the Lightshaking Tower, which had allowed all of them to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun’s name was not included in the Top 100 Rankings as he was a hidden ultra expert of the Sword Sect. His status meant that it was of no surprise to anyone that he had been able to cause the Shenwu Continent’s Crown Prince Ming Hao to be so afraid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin returned to the ground with a solemn expression. Long Yun’s arrival was something that was unavoidable. He represented the Sword Sect’s intention to seize the mountain range, and there was bound to be a battle between the two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spacecraft landed outside of Pyrolyte Mountain as Mu Rong, Liu Shaoqiu, Yōu Ye'er, and the others all watched on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the hatch opened, a youth wearing a felt hat, short-sleeved shirt, and jeans walked out with a faint smile as he curiously observed his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they looked at this youth, Liu Shaoqiu and the other Sword Sect disciples felt a jolt run through their hearts. “Senior Long?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yōu Ye'er blinked. She did not recognize this person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s Long Yun, one of the Sword Sect’s disciples from the previous generation,” an expert from Yōu Court quietly informed her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yōu Ye'er was curious. “How do you know? Is he very famous?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That Yōu Court cultivator explained, “This person is in the same generation as the Arbiter from the Sword Sect, and the two of them do not have a simple relationship. During their time together, this person ranked within the top three of the sect. However, after the Sword Sect’s Arbiter broke through to become an Explorer, this person grew quieter until there was nothing left to say about him. Who would have imagined that the Sword Sect would send him here now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun’s timely arrival caused the Sword Sect disciples to clearly relax, but they were also rather apprehensive. To their understanding, Long Yun was a bold and uninhibited roamer, but nobody knew what his actual power was. However, if the Sword Sect had sent him down, then he definitely would not be weak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun glanced across everyone present before finally settling his eyes on Lu Yin, who was already staring at Long Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ve met before, right?” Long Yun beamed at Lu Yin. He spoke by using his star energy to make the air vibrate, thus producing sound.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin answered, “In the Outerverse, during the trial on Shenwu Continent, we met once.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun nodded. “You should be the one who rescued that group from the Tower of Resonating Light. The moment I heard about that feat, I already knew that you were not someone simple, but I never imagined that you were only a Limiteer. Your strength is terrifying.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked at him gravely. “You’re not simple either. Your true strength surpasses even Ze Lin’s.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sentence shook the Sword Sect members and even shocked the various great powers in outer space. Not many of them had heard of Long Yun’s name, and those who had were of the same generation as the Ten Arbiters. Long Yun had initially been rather famous, but his glory had gradually dimmed, so no one would have expected that he could rival an expert ranked in the top sixty of the Top 100 Rankings. This was a rather deep concealment, as the Sword Sect still had someone at the top of the rankings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu’s eyes flickered, as he had already known that Long Yun’s power was not simple, though he had never checked into the concrete details before. Back at the sect, Long Yun did not like to fight, and he was also rather laid-back. Liu Shaoqiu had never found an opportunity to exchange blows with Long Yun, but he had never thought that Lu Yin’s appraisal of his senior would be so high.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun was surprised by Lu Yin’s words as well. “How did you know that? Only a few old folks in the entire Sword Sect know of my strength.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes lit up. “I guessed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun nodded. “No matter how you know, you won’t be able to avoid me today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun pulled out a very ordinary looking longsword from his cosmic ring. Under everyone’s shocked gazes, green lines twisted around the blade, and a dark-gold radiance illuminated the void as a stifling and boundless pressure swept across.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone felt their hearts seize for a moment as they stared at Long Yun while feeling completely overwhelmed. He was glowing with a dark-gold radiance, and his sword had green lines twisting about it. That was six-lined battle force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strongest cultivators on Planet Pyrolyte to battle up till now had only ever had five-lined battle force, but Long Yun had raised the standard by one bar. His green, six-lined battle force was being prominently displayed before everyone else now.</span></p>
