He wanted to discover what the Fourth Sword could do to Ling Que so that he could compare himself to an unparalleled Limiteer. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did not have to wait for long as the Fourth Sword was suddenly unleashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment that it moved, Ling Que’s eyes lit up and his body suddenly split into two. Two Que's Mighty Slashes revolved around his bodies, spinning rapidly as he anticipated the arrival of the Fourth Sword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before, at the Sea King’s Dome, Ling Que had faced off against Mu Rong’s full-strength forcefield by taking the extreme action of splitting into three clones. The three Que's Mighty Slashes had then worked in tandem to form a defense that barely managed to block Mu Rong’s strike. But now, against the Fourth Sword, Ling Que had only split into two clones, as he was confident that he could block this attack. In other words, the Fourth Sword did not give him the same sense of crisis that Mu Rong’s forcefield had.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ground rumbled as an overpowering shockwave swept out in all directions, just like when the Fourth Sword and Zhanlong Daynight had collided in the previous battle. The strength of the aftershock even manifested in a visible, lightning-like pattern that spread out. Not only did it tear through the void, but it also shattered the ground and caused numerous fissures to appear far off in the distance. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was overwhelmed, and they looked towards Pyrolyte Mountain, as a battle of an abnormal level was now taking place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the air cleared, Nightqueen Yanqing and Zhanlong Daynight stared above Pyrolyte Mountain. They first saw Liu Shaoqiu and then an unscathed Ling Que.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As expected, Ling Que had blocked the Fourth Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Others would have described the situation as not a single hair of Ling Que’s being harmed, but Ling Que himself knew that it was not that simple. Liu Shaoqiu’s attack had not been easy for him to defend against, and he had almost been forced to split into a third clone and summon a third Que’s Mighty Slash to protect himself. This was the Fourth Sword, and it was indeed very powerful. Liu Shaoqiu was likely just behind Ling Que and Mu Rong in terms of power, and he possessed a similar strength as that Lan Dao from the Grayweed Continent who had fought against Mu Rong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this was Liu Shaoqiu’s current limit. Ling Que raised a hand, and his Que's Mighty Slash shot through the void, suddenly splattering blood through the sky. Liu Shaoqiu fell—his right arm had been impaled, and his longsword was dislodged from his grasp. It plummeted down into the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu had been defeated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Fourth Sword had drained too much of his energy, so he had not even been able to defend himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que stood high in the sky, displaying his overbearing style of doing as he pleased as an unequalled Limiteer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sword Sect disciples far in the distance were grieving, as Liu Shaoqiu had been defeated. Not only had he lost in this battle, but he would also be out of commission for quite a while. He would find it difficult to participate in anymore battles on Planet Pyrolyte since that woman, Nightqueen Yanqing, would not let him off easily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Xiaoyun gripped her fists, but there was nothing she could do either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yōu Ye'er sighed, but she was similarly helpless. They were simply too weak. However, what would it be like if she could erupt with all her strength? The little girl was looking forward to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qian'er looked at Ling Que with surprise as he towered over Pyrolyte Mountain. When she had been in the Wen family’s holdings, she had even dreamed of challenging Lu Yin, but Ling Que had just shown her how ridiculous her original thoughts had been. Even someone like Ling Que was inferior to Lu Yin, yet this person had already been enough to make everyone feel powerless. It went without saying that Lu Yin, as the strongest, was not on the same level at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xi Yue was stunned, as this had shown her the strength of the universe’s top elites. If this person was already this powerful, then how had Lu Yin managed to become number one? She could not even imagine it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight walked out from the shadow of Pyrolyte Mountain and directly faced Ling Que.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que turned to face the Daynight clan member, as this person gave off a feeling that he was no weaker than Liu Shaoqiu. Before Ling Que arrived, Liu Shaoqiu had been held back by this person. Ling Que could clearly see that this person was from the Daynight clan.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Interesting, is he provoking me?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing knew that the situation was taking a turn for the worse as soon as she saw Zhanlong Daynight walk out. She rushed over to him and threatened him in a quiet voice, whispering, “If you dare ruin our clan’s mission, you will definitely be imprisoned in the ancestral grounds as soon as you return. Consider your next actions carefully.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight was reluctant to back down, but he did not continue to antagonize Ling Que. He really wanted to fight against this person and experience the Soulsplitting Technique and Que's Mighty Slash for himself, so he felt it was a pity that he was being restrained.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu’s left hand supported his body while fresh blood dripped down his right arm and off of his fingers. He walked over to his sword that was embedded in the ground. The blade of the sword had rusted long ago, but this blade had continued to follow him for many years. He had not taken the blade out even against Zhanlong Daynight, but he had used it against Ling Que. Despite that, he had still been defeated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing’s eyes revealed her bloodlust as she stared at Liu Shaoqiu. She walked over. She wanted to give him some injuries and ensure that he would not be able to act again in the near future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que frowned. He did not approve of such behavior, but he did not stop her either.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind him, the cheerleaders appeared again. “Ling Que, Ling Que, I love you! Ling Que, Ling Que, you’re the best!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ling Que, Ling Que, I love you! Ling Que, Ling Que, you’re the best!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu felt frustrated when he saw Nightqueen Yanqing approaching him step by step. He had fallen so low, but he was not about to be trampled upon after losing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, a fiery red color crashed down from space, aiming straight at Pyrolyte Mountain and the people gathered there.&nbsp;</span></p>

Who was about to appear? The various organizations overseeing the proceedings on Planet Pyrolyte were all focused on the region around Pyrolyte Mountain.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What kind of self-confidence does one need to land right at Pyrolyte Mountain in this current situation?&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight was also shocked at the sudden turn of events.</span></p>

No one had told him that Mu Rong would come. If he had known that this brat would also come to Planet Pyrolyte, then Ling Que would not have made the trip here even if someone beat him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Damn it, why didn’t anyone tell me this?

How had Mu Rong managed to appear so quickly? It must be that the Sword Sect had released fake news and been lying to them. The Wen family was smart, but the Sword Sect was not foolish either. The Sword Sect must have long since expected that their enemies would want to take advantage of the timing discrepancies, and so, they must have deliberately exaggerated the time difference to cause their opponents to relax their guard. Then, their disciples on the ground would just have to hold out until Mu Rong arrived. And now, trouble had finally arrived.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Xiaoyun relaxed, as that person had finally come.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yōu Ye'er stared with wide eyes, as an even fiercer person had just arrived, so they no longer needed to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong’s appearance caused the whole area to fall silent as everyone stared at him. He looked around and swept his gaze over everyone before finally stopping on Ling Que. “Who are you helping?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que’s face contorted, and he turned around to address his cheerleaders, “Hey girls, go back to space in your vessel. Don’t stay here. It’s too dangerous.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girls were moved. They wanted to stay, but Ling Que’s persistent orders dissuaded them. He was panicking, as he was not confident in being able to beat Mu Rong. It hadn’t been very long since they had last fought, and he still had not come up with a method to defeat this person yet. He did not want to be embarrassed in a fight with Mu Rong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all of the cheerleaders left, and Ling Que turned to face Mu Rong. “I’m helping the Wen family.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong looked at Liu Shaoqiu. “Are you the Sword Sect’s Liu Shaoqiu?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu nodded. “You’re Mu Rong?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong calmly replied, “I’ve received an invitation from the Sword Sect to participate in this contest on Planet Pyrolyte. Is everyone else here the enemy?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong turned to face Zhanlong Daynight and Nightqueen Yanqing. Now, his eyes had a different light to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing felt her scalp go numb, as she never imagined that she would end up directly facing Mu Rong. She wanted to say something, but Zhanlong Daynight moved from beside her to charge straight out towards Mu Rong, letting loose a punch. It was a formidable attack, and his body was covered in a radiant brilliance from the Daynight Restoration Technique.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like Liu Shaoqiu had eagerly attacked Ling Que, Zhanlong Daynight was very excited to face Mu Rong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing felt anxious, but she no longer had any choice in the matter, and she immediately attacked Liu Shaoqiu. She needed to make sure that this person could not fight in the immediate future.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong squinted, and green grass extended out from beneath his feet. He immediately unleashed his forcefield, and everyone saw the image of the shepherd boy and the cow appear before them. In that instance, Zhanlong Daynight, Nightqueen Yanqing, and Ling Que were all suppressed by Mu Rong, and they felt so restrained that they almost coughed up blood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Against Zhanlong Daynight’s punch, Mu Rong merely backed up a bit and spun his wooden flute around before resolving the attack with Floating Stride. Even further away, a shepherd boy appeared above Liu Shaoqiu’s head before striking down at Nightqueen Yanqing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her entire body felt like it was falling apart, as she was powerless to resist this attack. There was a whoosh as the blade of Que's Mighty Slash appeared and sliced towards the shepherd boy, leaving the void distorted in its wake. There was a bang as Nightqueen Yanqing was sent flying away, and she spat out a mouthful of blood while still in midair; her Nightking’s Body had been almost completely destroyed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If not for Que's Mighty Slash, she would have directly received the attack from Mu Rong’s forcefield. Although it had not been an all-out attack, even Ling Que did not dare to be careless against such attacks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight’s punch missed its target, but he quickly followed up with another punch, and this one shook the void. However, all of his attacks were useless against Mu Rong; his Floating Stride was able to even negate Que's Mighty Slash, much less Zhanlong Daynight’s attacks. If Mu Rong felt like it, he could dodge Zhanlong Daynight’s punches for several days without being hit a single time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight’s advantage was in his abnormal recovery rate, but his attacks were completely useless against Mu Rong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong used his Floating Stride to nullify Zhanlong Daynight’s attacks while in another area, his forcefield that manifested as the shepherd boy on the cow attacked Ling Que. Mu Rong intended to face all three of them simultaneously by himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu was stunned, as Mu Rong was revealing his true strength; the young man feared no one.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que fought an urge to curse as he received the attack from Mu Rong’s forcefield. The attack launched against Ling Que was on an entirely different level than the attack Nightqueen Yanqing had faced. Mu Rong was using his full strength against Ling Que.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Helpless, Ling Que used the Soulsplitting Technique and divided into three clones. He then used the three Que's Mighty Slashes to defend himself as they clashed directly against the shepherd boy and the cow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same exact time, Mu Rong brushed past Zhanlong Daynight as his wooden flute struck Zhanlong’s body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two collisions exploded at the same time, causing two visible shockwaves to sweep out in every direction. Space was shredded apart like raindrops as the aftershocks reached far into the distance, leaving many dumbfounded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing and Liu Shaoqiu were sent flying by the two colliding aftershocks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, Wen Qian'er and the other onlookers acted in unison, pooling all of their power together to resist the aftershocks. Despite their best efforts, there were still quite a few cultivators who spat out blood before falling unconscious due to the sheer force of the aftershock. Some people even fell into the cracks that had spread across the ground, possibly dead. Zhuo Daynight was also sent flying by the force, spitting out more blood in the process.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, Pyrolyte Mountain was not directly hit by the shockwave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Throughout the battle, everyone had avoided causing any direct impact to Pyrolyte Mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One strike had suppressed two great experts. This demonstrated Mu Rong’s power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also not the end, but rather the beginning. The wooden flute sounded out, and Ling Que simply took off, already certain that he would not be able to withstand Mu Rong’s next move. His innate gift was too perverse, and it allowed him to directly control others’ bodies. Only those like Lu Yin who possessed a freakish physical strength could break free from Mu Rong’s innate gift.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight watched as Ling Que fled, but he was not an idiot either. He knew that he could not resist Mu Rong on his own. He also took off, though he was reluctant to do so. He clearly understood his own strength, and he knew that all of his attacks would be utterly useless against Mu Rong. Thus, he would only end up as a punching bag if he stayed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong alone had gained control of the entire situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, Wen Qian'er and the rest watched on, hesitant to believe that the outcome had already been decided. Things had been resolved at a speed that they found hard to accept.</span></p>
