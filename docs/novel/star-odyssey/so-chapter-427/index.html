She vowed to teach this bastard a lesson in the future. How had she never realized how shameless he was before?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, you’ve offended a girl. You’re on your own now,” the monkey cackled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin felt helpless. He had not realized it before, but he really wanted some more of those Money Bombs. Given Lulu’s wealth, she would not simply sell them off, so that had been the only way he was going to get them. After all, he could not truly tell Lulu Undying Yushan’s secret. Fortunately, Lulu held no bad intentions, and at most, she would retaliate out of spite, which was something that could be settled through some coaxing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group didn’t stay in the shack for too long. A loud noise was soon heard outside, and the sky was torn apart. Lu Yin and the rest all stood up. “Alright, it’s time to go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Outside of Deep Crimson Planet, the Hunter from the Blackbeard Pirates who was responsible for collecting the tribute in this region looked down at the planet with a fierce expression. In response, two Hunters quickly tore through the void and appeared in outer space. They were the Bo Duo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who are you? Why are you attacking our Deep Crimson Hall?” Bo Senior barked as he looked at the person in front of him with some caution in his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Hunter raised his head and spoke in a gloomy sounding voice. “I am Ramus. Bo Duo, you two are really audacious! You even dare to touch what belongs to the Blackbeard Pirates!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Bo Duo exchanged surprised looks. “You’re from the Blackbeard Pirates?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ramus sneered, “You’re asking for death by still playing innocent.” He then raised a hand, causing the void to distort as his surging star energy transformed into a sharp wind that flowed over everything nearby. It tore apart the surrounding space before shooting down towards Deep Crimson Planet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Bo Duo hurriedly moved to block the attack since it was strong enough to destroy Deep Crimson Planet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, chaos erupted beneath Han Da. Big Pao, Little Pao, Meng Yue, and Zhao Yilong had roused the other captured cultivators and started a rebellion. The few Cruisers of Deep Crimson Hall tried to restrain them, only to be met by Lu Yin, Xia Luo, and the rest of the students. Such a chaotic scene erupted beneath Han Da, and it quickly caused the earth to split open.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of Deep Crimson Hall’s Cruisers was sent flying by Lu Yin, both of his arms snapping off. He was shocked that this Limiteer was able to battle against him, a Cruiser, as there were not many such people even within the scope of the entire universe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Luo, Lulu, and the others were not weak, either, and they joined forces to obstruct another Cruiser. Big Pao and Little Pao seemed to go crazy as they attacked some of Deep Crimson Hall’s powerhouses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Quite a number of the other captives were Explorers, and they all joined in, starting an intense battle against Deep Crimson Hall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Da had turned into a battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Above the planet, the Bo Duo received a report about the situation, but they were too busy to pay attention to it since Ramus’ power level surpassed their own. The pirate Hunter had repeatedly insisted they had stolen a tribute and wouldn’t give them any chance to explain themselves, so they were only able to forcefully resist his attacks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beneath Han Da, Lu Yin grabbed Big Pao. “Let’s go! Deep Crimson Hall has a good relationship with the Relentless Slayers, so their experts will be here soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Pao nodded without hesitation. “Alright, let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their group sped towards the space station, which was fortunately fairly close by to Han Da. They quickly moved to seize some spacecraft since numerous vessels had been impounded. However, a battle had also erupted at the space station, since the recently escaped captives were now fighting each other over who could obtain a spacecraft.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Deep Crimson Planet had been under lockdown for quite some time, and there were many trapped cultivators who wanted to leave. Thus, they all leapt at this opportunity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Numerous spacecraft entered outer space one after another, but they all exploded after flying out a certain distance. There were Cruisers from Deep Crimson Hall who were watching over the region, and they were attacking anyone who tried to leave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even so, there were quite a few spacecraft that continued taking off and shooting into space in an attempt to escape.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most of the people who had been imprisoned on Deep Crimson Planet were from the Outerverse. They were people who had wanted to enter the Innerverse to become stronger but had been captured by Deep Crimson Hall and forced to work as miners. Since they didn’t have any strong backers, they had assumed that they would never be able to escape from their fate as slaves. But at this moment, they saw the opportunity to escape, and many of them would rather die fighting for freedom than resign themselves to a lifetime of slavery.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In outer space, above the planet, two of Deep Crimson Hall’s Cruisers led more than ten Explorers to intercept the fleeing vessels, causing explosions to ring out from time to time. Occasionally, other powerhouses would appear to fight against the Deep Crimson Hall’s experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin felt helpless when he saw this scene, and he immediately abandoned his personal Aurora to join up with Xia Luo and the others. The only way they would be able to escape from this planet was by working together.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They grabbed a small spacecraft that looked inconspicuous, but it wasn’t fast. As soon as they left the planet, they were discovered by one of Deep Crimson Hall’s Cruisers, who attacked them with a strike that shattered the void.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin didn’t move. Instead, Big Pao and Little Pao moved to the top of the spacecraft, where they worked together to stop the attack. They could kill a normal Cruiser when they joined forces, so blocking this attack was no problem for them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That Cruiser had not expected them to successfully block his attack, and he immediately felt that something was wrong. There were very few people on Deep Crimson Planet who could battle against Cruisers. Thus, this group had the ability to possibly kill Cruisers, which meant that they might even be the people they had been searching for all this time. The moment he realized this, he immediately shot off in pursuit of the spacecraft while he informed the rest of Deep Crimson Hall of what had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the spacecraft, the group from Astral-10 watched the screen as it displayed number after number, representing the power level of all the experts nearby. Each number was over 10,000, and two of them even exceeded 50,000, which meant that Deep Crimson Hall had sent Cruisers after them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lulu, it’s your turn!” Lu Yin shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youths all turned to look at her as her face turned ugly and she stared at Lu Yin. “Why isn’t it your turn? Aren’t you a man?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lulu was indignant, but she nonetheless donned her universal armor and moved on top of the spacecraft.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Pao and Little Pao turned to look at Lulu in shock. “Why are you out here?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lulu was already in a bad mood, so she didn’t even bother responding. She wordlessly pulled out two Money Bombs and aimed one at a Cruiser in front of them and the other at the Cruiser who had been chasing them from the beginning. Star energy condensed as two light rays instantly shot out, killing the two Cruisers before they could even react.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene was shocking, and it caused all of Deep Crimson Hall’s members to freeze as they stared at Lulu in horror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“GO!” Lulu raised her head and shouted before going back inside the spacecraft.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Pao and Little Pao exchanged surprised glances. It turned out that Lulu actually possessed such powerful weapons.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The experts from Deep Crimson Hall watched on blankly as the spacecraft left, not one of them daring to give chase.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In another area of outer space, Ramus tore through the seal on Deep Crimson Planet and descended into Deep Crimson Hall’s headquarters. He followed the signal and soon discovered the star essence in the kitchen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Bo Duo’s faces were as white as death. “Hurry up and check the security footage! Find out who hid this here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ramus was no idiot. Since only the star essence with a tracking device in it had been placed in this kitchen, it was enough to prove that the thief had discovered the device. In other words, Deep Crimson Hall had indeed been framed. Ramus crushed the star essence apart and stared at the Bo Duo. He then spoke in a deep voice. “Find me that person at once, or your Deep Crimson Hall will join him in his grave.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So what if they had been framed? The Blackbeard Pirate Group were tyrants. It didn’t matter if someone had actually committed a crime or not—anyone who had been implicated would be found guilty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Bo Duo became rather sullen at this command, but they had no choice since the Blackbeard Pirates had given it. At that moment, a video was transmitted to them. It was the scene of Lulu killing two Cruisers with her Money Bombs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Bo Duo was enraged at the sight. Deep Crimson Hall did not have many Cruisers to begin with, and now, two had been blasted to death in an instant. This was practically creating a blood feud.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ramus also saw the video, and he frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Strange, why does that weapon seem so familiar?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;He felt like he had seen it somewhere before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ramus, the people who robbed you of your tribute should be a part of this group that’s created a huge mess on my Deep Crimson Planet. They must have done this in order to escape,” Bo Senior said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ramus squinted. “Are you talking about the group on that small spacecraft?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Definitely,” Bo Junior replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ramus sneered, “Do you know how strong the pirate captain who was plundered was? He was a Cruiser! His body received multiple powerful attacks that damaged his internal organs. Tell me, does that vessel carry an expert who can severely injure a Cruiser?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bo Senior replied, “They have that weapon that can instantly kill a Cruiser.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A weapon is a weapon, but the robbed captain was injured by a person. He was injured by a palm and not a weapon. There are only two Explorers on that ship, and the others aren’t even Explorers! Or are you perhaps trying to tell me that a Limiteer can severely injure a Cruiser?” Ramus’s tone was incredulous. “Then tell me, are Ye Xingchen, Mu Rong, or Ling Que on that ship?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them could only think of those three Limiteers who could defeat Cruisers. To them, as far as they knew, Lu Yin was dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Bo Duo were unable to respond.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Deep Crimson Hall has offended way too many people, and there’ll be many Cruisers among your enemies as well. The other party must be trying to use my Blackbeard Pirates to get rid of you. I’ll make this clear: if that tribute’s not delivered to me within a month, I’ll do as they wish and take you out. This is how my Blackbeard Pirates work!” Ramus left them with those words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pirate groups didn’t follow any fixed laws; they only recognized the law of the pirate, which was to plunder. Deep Crimson Hall was worthless in the eyes of the Blackbeard Pirates, but they also could not allow someone else to manipulate their pirate crew in such a way. In this next month, not only would Deep Crimson Hall look for the thief, but the pirates would search as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And they would prioritize investigating any Cruisers that Deep Crimson Hall had offended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Bo Duo did not stop Ramus from leaving. “Immediately request Mr. Mo to take action and stop that small spacecraft. We can track down the signals of all those that fled. Also, send a request to any allied powers located along their route and ask them to seal off any flight routes along the way. Regardless of if they are guilty, we still have them pay for killing two Cruisers of Deep Crimson Hall,” Bo Senior said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bo Junior acknowledged his orders and immediately left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they cruised through space inside the small spacecraft, Big Pao and Little Pao thanked the rest of the students for rescuing them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, exactly what sort of enmity do you have with Deep Crimson Hall?” Coco asked, as the rest of them only had a general idea of the brothers’ background. They were all unsure of the details.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two exchanged glances, and then Little Pao replied in a low tone, “We were born in an organization known as Blackfire Hall, a sworn enemy of Deep Crimson Hall. Both powers were of similar strength, and neither could do much to the other. However, the Bo Duo invited an expert from the Relentless Slayers to kill off our Blackfire Hall, and us brothers were only rescued by Astral-10 through a stroke of luck. However, not one other person from Blackfire Hall survived.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youths fell silent, as any struggle between powers in the universe was cruel. It was often difficult to pinpoint who was right or wrong. If Blackfire Hall had possessed the capability, then they definitely would have wiped out Deep Crimson Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Bo Duo are both Hunters, so it’s still too early for Seniors to think of revenge. Just give it some time. At least wait until you guys are Cruisers as well,” Lu Yin cautioned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two were in despair. “You’re right. We were too impatient, and we even dragged in all you juniors into the fray.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lulu waved her hand magnanimously. “No biggie. We’ll just treat this trip as a cruise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others looked at her strangely, though she was indeed qualified to say such things. Would it even matter if she was captured by Deep Crimson Hall? She would just need to tell them her name to make the Bo Duo politely send her off. Her background was something that they could not afford to offend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, everyone, let’s stop chatting. The path ahead of us has been sealed, so we need to think of another way through.” Meng Yue spoke up after staring at a screen.</span></p>
