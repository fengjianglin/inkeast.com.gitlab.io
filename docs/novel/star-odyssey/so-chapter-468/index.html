 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-abc97b10-7fff-6d99-b7f6-95231b81d7ce"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin could do the same since, at this point, his battle strength already rivaled that war spirit’s. With Mister Mu’s help, the limits of Lu Yin’s physical strength had been upgraded to an extreme, where Lu Yin needed to pay a price in order to suppress and control his strength, just like the war spirit with closed eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had already reached that war spirit’s level, as he had reached the pinnacle in one specific aspect. However, Mu Rong had not attained such a level yet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The farmer boy’s song abruptly stopped while Lu Yin’s left arm halted a centimeter away from Mu Rong’s head. He had used his powerful physical strength to directly overcome the controlling power of the farmer boy’s song.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked up at Mu Rong. He saw a confused look on his face, which was the first time Mu Rong had ever shown such an expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surprise in Mu Rong’s heart could not be hidden at all. When Lu Yin forcefully broke through the farmer boy's song, Mu Rong knew that he had lost. Lu Yin’s move had brought him too intense a shock, and he had only felt this once before when he had met the Ten Arbiters in the past.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many had compared Mu Rong to the Ten Arbiters and the strength they had displayed when they were Limiteers, but Mu Rong could not be bothered with such a comparison precisely because he understood how terrifying those people were. Those ten freaks could not be understood with common sense, as their strength simply defied any attempt made to understand them. Even with his farmer boy's song, Mu Rong still did not dare to compare himself to them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the reason why he had looked down upon Lu Yin; Lu Yin was too flamboyant. He had only become a Ten Arbiters’ candidate after the Astral Combat Tournament, and he seemed to reach his peak after the Tournament of the Strongest. Being able to use Thirty Stacks had made Lu Yin the most dazzling of the various Ten Arbiters candidates, but from Mu Rong’s perspective, this person did not understand their strength at all. He had seen Lu Yin as nothing more than a clown.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Rong now understood that Lu Yin was no clown; rather, he was a rare true super powerhouse who could rival the Ten Arbiters. He was genuinely unequaled within the same realm, and Mu Rong was certain that even Ye Xingchen would be no match for Lu Yin. This person was so powerful while still in the Limiteer realm that it had reached the levels of incomprehensible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had allowed Mu Rong to witness the birth of a new monster. Mu Rong had been declared as an unequaled Limiteer by the Ten Arbiters and represented their vision, but Lu Yin had surpassed that. He had risen to the same level that the Ten Arbiters had as Limiteers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin lowered his left arm, relieved that he had broken free from the farmer boy's controlling song. If he had encountered Mu Rong before entering that separate space with the golden ocean, he would have lost without question. The universe was indeed vast and contained all kinds of geniuses. After defeating Mu Rong, Lu Yin could be considered as one who stood at the pinnacle of all Limiteers. However, he secretly cautioned himself to not be careless, as he was still being compared with just Limiteers. His true opponents were the Ten Arbiters themselves, those immeasurable freaks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone stared dumbfoundedly, and all of Halfwillow Lakeside fell completely silent. Before too much time passed, a voice called out, “I admit defeat.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was Mu Rong’s voice. His wooden flute split apart after he finished speaking before completely vanishing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The countless people watching were stunned, but then the crowd erupted in cheers. No one had favored Lu Yin’s victory before the battle started, and so when he achieved victory, the cheers they gave him were even more resounding. Moreover, Lu Yin was the Sea King Dome’s future son-in-law, so it made the audience feel glorious, as he was already partially one of them. The Sea King's Dome was the strongest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin quietly let the Fatesand merge back into his left arm and heart, causing his physical strength to rapidly decline.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only variable during this battle had been the farmer boy's song. As soon as it had proven ineffective against Lu Yin, Mu Rong had no longer been able to retaliate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had not even used his Fatesand during this battle. Of course, the difference that would have been made would be relatively minor since even the Fatesand could not withstand Mu Rong’s innate gift of the farmer boy's song.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que sighed in the distance, rather disappointed. He had thought that everything would end the moment the farmer boy's song appeared, but he had expected that Lu Yin would be such a freak. How had he cultivated his physical strength to those levels? It was just too absurd.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cheng Wu, Northgate Lie, and the rest all left. They were afraid of being seen by Lu Yin and being challenged. That would be bad, as being defeated by a Limiteer would be absolutely humiliating.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Michelle and the others had complicated expressions as they watched Lu Yin. Was the difference between him and them really that vast? They had thought that they could still see his back, but after this battle, they felt like he was so far ahead of them that he was basically out of sight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Luo smiled, and he looked at Lu Yin with a bit of excitement and competitiveness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, Hai Dashao gathered his gaze, seemingly having fallen into deep thought. This Lu Yin had cultivated his physical body to an extraordinary degree, and as soon as he broke through to the Explorer realm, he would definitely rank within the top fifty on the Top 100 Rankings, or perhaps even higher. This person was truly a Ten Arbiters’ candidate, which Hai Dashao himself had to admit. He could see that Lu Yin had the potential to eventually challenge the top ten on the Top 100 Rankings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother, let me ask you a serious question.” Hai Qiqi looked solemnly at Hai Dashao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Dashao nodded, as he knew that Hai Qiqi must be experiencing various conflicting emotions after watching the fight. “Shoot.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Have you guys ever considered the possibility of domestic abuse?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This one sentence threw Hai Dashao’s mind into disarray. He waved his hand and tore through the void to leave, not even knowing how to reply to Hai Qiqi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi gritted her teeth in frustration. “Isn’t that a valid question? If I’m really married to such a violent maniac, then what will I do if he beats me?” She then chased after Hai Dashao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Halfwillow Lakeside had been ruined by this battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong left, though he was not as disappointed as Ling Que by losing. Although Lu Yin’s strength had shocked him, he quickly calmed down. To him, the outcome of the battle wasn’t that important. Since his strength had already been revealed a few days ago, it was already enough to satisfy his goals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stretched lazily; he had won. This time, even that old fellow, the Sea King, should be happy, which meant that Lu Yin would not need to take responsibility for the bill of 30,000 star essence, which was a relief.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Dingtian slowly walked over from where he had been watching.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After uttering just one single word, the scene before Lu Yin’s eyes changed. He returned to the area beneath the waterfall once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was speechless. “Senior Sea King, please allow this junior to chat with that person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Reflect well on this battle. If not for your extreme physical strength, how else could you have won?” the Sea King’s voice sounded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s heart moved, and he sighed. His talk with Zhang Dingtian could only wait till later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beside Halfwillow Lakeside, Zhang Dingtian stared at the empty space in front of him for a moment and then turned around to silently leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire Sea King's Dome was discussing Lu Yin’s battle with Mu Rong. As for the ranking of the four strongest Limiteers, Lu Yin was now placed firmly at the top while Ling Que had been moved down to number four, which left him very upset.. He could only concede that he had no chances of beating Lu Yin or Mu Rong, but why was even Ye Xingchen ranked above him? He could not accept such a thing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Xingchen had roamed the Cosmic Sea as a Limiteer, which was indeed admirable. However, no one believed that he had used his own strength to survive there, as that was impossible. It wasn’t even realistic for a Hunter to roam the Cosmic Sea by themselves, which meant that Ye Xingchen’s time there had to have something more to it. As for his true strength, Ling Que really wanted to have a fight with Ye Xingchen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">News of the battle quickly spread out from the Sea King's Dome, and more people learned of it as time passed. However, it still took some time for it to spread to the rest of the universe since the battle had not been broadcast like the Astral Combat Tournament.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Ten Arbiters were among the first to learn about the details of this battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Innerverse, in a certain area, Wen Sansi looked at the information he had received from the Starfall Sea, and he laughed heartily. He had always maintained a certain elegance, and he hardly ever revealed such a joyous appearance, but Lu Yin’s victory over Mu Rong had truly delighted him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong was&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">that&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">guy’s underling. The Ten Arbiters often recruited powerhouses with powerful innate gifts to work under them, but no Limiteer could avoid being compared to Mu Rong. Within the Limiteer realm, the other nine’s recruits were all inferior to that bugger, Mu Rong. This was why Wen Sansi had previously had Mira release some information about Mu Rong to Lu Yin, in hopes that Lu Yin would be able to defeat him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It didn’t matter if Lu Yin was on Wen Sansi’s side or not. As long as he defeated Mu Rong, the rest of them would be able to breathe easier as they would no longer need to bear that guy’s suppression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, everything was just a struggle in name, and it would not affect the overall situation. However, anyone who had been suppressed for so many years would think of resisting, and Mu Rong had finally been defeated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mira, report this piece of good news to the Ten Arbiters Council.” Wen Sansi was very happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On a screen, Mira nodded and gave a slight smile. “Yes, Arbiter Wen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It didn’t take long for the video of Lu Yin’s victory over Mu Rong to appear on the Ten Arbiters Council network, which caused quite a commotion. Through the Ten Arbiters Council’s interface, it directly reached the ears of powerful groups such as the Daynight clan and the Lingling clan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing was stumped as she stared blankly at the video. All the air seemed to have been sucked out of her. “Why is it like this? The disparity is actually that great?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was currently in the ancestral region of the Daynight clan, and there was a Nightking elder before her. Nearby, there was a figure who stood tall like an iron tower. If Lu Yin was present, he would be stupefied upon realizing that this figure was none other than Zhanlong Daynight, who should have still been trapped in the Shenwu Continent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Erudite Flowzone, the Wen family also saw the video. The younger generation only saw the fight as a struggle for the title of the most powerful Limiteer, but the large clans saw a different picture—another form of struggle. When the Ten Arbiters inevitably left the scene, a new batch of people would wield power over the younger generation. Lu Yin’s battle with Mu Rong was a sign for this second phase of struggling to rule the younger generation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qian’er, you must now realize that there’s always someone stronger, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uncle, Qian’er wants to experience the strength of the strongest Limiteer. Then I will break through as an Explorer. Otherwise, I won’t be satisfied.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That isn’t very easy. Why don’t you get your cousin to take you to the Ten Arbiters Council? Then, you can battle with Mu Rong.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, I must experience the most powerful. I want to fight against Lu Yin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On a certain planet, countless broken swords were stabbed into the ground, and off in the distance there was a towering sword peak. Liu Shaoqiu stood at the top as he watched the video, his gaze revealing his shock. Lu Yin had already surpassed him by a great margin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Liu Shaoqiu reflected on this, he closed the screen and looked up, his gaze firm. He would not forget his promise with Lu Yin to challenge the Top 100 Rankings together. He refused to be inferior to Lu Yin, so he would climb this sword mountain that his female senior had once trained on, and he would transform once again. The Sword Sect would always be the strongest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a certain area of the Outerverse, Xi Yue also watched the video. When she finished, she looked up with a complex gaze. Perhaps this person would be able to help them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a certain area in the Innerverse, a man closed his eyes. “It’s getting closer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Barely a few days after the battle at Halfwillow Lakeside, Michelle and the rest left the Sea King’s Dome, leaving only Big Pao and Little Pao behind. The two brothers could only patiently wait in the Sea King's Dome until they verified that the Bo Duo and Feng Mo would not cause them any more trouble, though that did not seem likely to happen anytime soon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Faceless also left the Sea King's Dome, and after witnessing the battle at Halfwillow Lakeside, he felt that he had underestimated Lu Yin previously. This person’s status in the clan might be even higher than what he had previously imagined, as he had defeated Mu Rong without using any death energy. That was no simple strength, and perhaps only that person from the Neohuman Alliance could rival him!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he could not talk to Lu Yin any longer, so he could neither report the news concerning the Bo Duo’s deaths nor Feng Mo’s escape.</span></p>
