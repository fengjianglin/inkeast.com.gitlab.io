If he retreated because of just one power vessel, then the various great powers would be able to use similar means to threaten him in the future. This was not his style, and although this power vessel was powerful, the power within it could not have surpassed the strength of a Hunter with a power level of 100,000. Lu Yin had his universal armor, which, conservatively, could withstand an attack with a power level of 150,000.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can try.” Lu Yin stared at Ze Lin. The Explorer was about to act, as making the first move was equivalent to seizing the advantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ze Lin’s heart sank, as his power vessel could indeed only be used once, and his elder had reminded him of that before he came to the surface of Planet Pyrolyte and that he was only allowed to use it as a last resort. However, the present situation made him feel like it was necessary to use it now. “You’re asking to die, so don’t blame me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ze Lin then brandished the dagger and charged towards Lu Yin. Lu Yin stared at the incoming figure intently as Ze Lin’s speed increased multiple times over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dagger stabbed out in a traceless manner, which was its ability. Additionally, it could also push the speed of its attack to the extreme while also greatly boosting Ze Lin’s speed as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s pupils constricted as he filled his eyes with star energy and pulled out the Giant Emperor’s third eye from his cosmic ring. He also unleashed his domain, managing to move to the side and dodge the dagger by a dozen centimeters. The dagger stabbed through Lu Yin’s original position and created a spatial fissure that extended on for 10,000 meters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ze Lin was completely incredulous as he looked at Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He dodged it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, not only Ze Lin, but the countless powers watching from above the planet were also overwhelmed. Lu Yin had actually dodged the power vessel’s attack when even a Hunter would find it difficult to dodge given Ze Lin’s speed during that last attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Karthika</span> <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">was the most stunned, as he had given that dagger to Ze Lin to enable the Explorer to stand up against the powerhouses that were soon to arrive from the Sword Sect, Daynight clan, Wen family, and other major powers. He had thought that the youth would be victorious with one strike, but it had been avoided just now, and the speed Lu Yin had demonstrated—no, that hadn’t been speed. That was Secret Sidestep!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The words “Secret Sidestep” appeared in many experts’ minds, and many people suddenly recalled that Lu Yin had also displayed this technique during his battle against Mu Rong at the Sea King’s Dome.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Secret Sidestep was revered by many Lockbreakers as the supreme footwork technique, and it was a technique that could be used to dodge invisible dangers from sourceboxes during lockbreaking attempts. If even invisible dangers could be evaded, then visible ones were non problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Ze Lin’s speed had been extraordinarily fast, it had not been so fast that he had become completely invisible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had four ways to enhance his perception: the Cosmic Art, his domain, filling his eyes with star energy, and the Giant Emperor’s third eye. With any three of those four active, he was able to use Secret Sidestep, and he was the least afraid of a speed-based trump card.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin relaxed as he watched that spatial crack gradually close itself. So the power vessel was about speed. He would not have been that worried if he had known its details earlier, and he had actually almost put on his universal armor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked at Ze Lin, who was staring at him in shock. Then, he placed one palm against Ze Lin’s chest. “It’s over.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Ze Lin could react, a Thirty Stacks Seventyfold Shockwave Palm was unleashed into his body, forcing Ze Lin to spit out a mouthful of blood. His outer clothes were shredded apart, and a deep palm imprint was left on his chest. His entire body was batted away like a shooting star, though that dagger was conveniently grabbed by Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If not for his carelessness, Ze Lin would not have been struck that easily. It could only be said that a power vessel had its advantages and disadvantages. When Lu Yin had dodged the earlier attack, it had caused Ze Lin to lose his concentration, which allowed Lu Yin to strike him. This singular strike had severely injured Ze Lin, as he had been pounded beneath the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The various major organizations fell silent above the planet. Even with the use of a power vessel, Ze Lin had been defeated. This Lu Yin was simply unnatural.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi cheered excitedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, Kuang Wang and the others looked miserable, as their Brother Ze Lin had been defeated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even further away, Zhanlong Daynight and the rest of the Daynight clan had also witnessed the scene, and they turned back around, helpless. This large mountain would continue to suppress everyone from high above them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes continued to be filled with star energy as he gazed underground. The rune lines that represented Ze Lin were now very few, which proved that, at this moment, the Explorer really was severely injured. Even the fusion with the <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Oolong</span> horse had come undone. Ze Lin was being crushed underground, and his face had turned deathly pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin released a breath. This battle had been rather challenging, and even a power vessel had appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had once considered the fact that the great powers must have their own hidden trumps, and even if their Limiteers did not use them, their Explorers might be able to. Ze Lin would likely not be the last Explorer to carry such a powerful tool. Did Lu Yin need to start wearing the universal armor to stay safe from now on? That was the question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi excitedly ran towards Lu Yin and stared at the dagger in his hands. “Let me take a look!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin held the dagger and ran a hand across it, but it seemed just like a normal dagger. He used a bit of force, and a crack appeared as the dagger broke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi was disappointed. “A single-use item. That’s worthless.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You know about power vessels as well?” Lu Yin looked at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi rolled her eyes. “Obviously. There’s nothing that my Sea King’s Dome is lacking in.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Does the Sea King's Dome have a lot of power vessels?” Lu Yin asked with interest.</span></p>

Beg me, and I’ll tell you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin shook his head, not bothering with her any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re so boring. My Sea King's Dome even has a power vessel that you’ve already touched.” Hai Qiqi acted very important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know, the Sea King's Trident.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi’s eyes widened. “How did you know?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I guessed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi turned around. “Boring.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, she flew over to where Ze Lin had crashed into the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin hurried after her. “What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t you want that star essence skin? I’ll help you,” Hai Qiqi offered eagerly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin directly pulled her away. “Don’t make trouble. He hasn’t lost yet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi stuck her tongue out at him and then ran away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ground quivered, and then it ruptured as Ze Lin jumped up and stood on the surface. He looked pathetic, and there was even a deep palm-print on his chest that was causing him endless agony. He was struggling to even stand and could only half-kneel on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin approached him. “One question.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ze Lin panted heavily and looked down at his chest, as even touching it caused him intense pain. At this moment, Lu Yin’s shadow had completely shrouded him, and he looked up. “You’ve won.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stared at him. “How much did it cost to make your star essence skin?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ze Lin’s eyelids twitched. “Lu Yin, do things in moderation. My Divine Grade Hall is no pushover, and you should know that the Beast Tamers Flowzone is a unified force. To thoroughly offend us won’t bring you anything good.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin shrugged. “I’m sorry, but it’s already too late. I actually wanted to coexist peacefully with you guys. Only fate can be blamed for toying with us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin then grabbed Ze Lin and went to find a spacecraft. After that, he quickly peeled off the star essence skin and threw the Explorer into the vessel. “Go back. I’m guessing that we won’t meet again on this planet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ze Lin looked helplessly at Lu Yin, and he truly regretted challenging this person the moment he had arrived on the planet. This person was a monster, and he had been severely injured as well. The next time they met, this person might already be an Explorer. Once Lu Yin broke through, Ze Lin definitely would not be Lu Yin’s opponent. He really was a freak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he watched the spacecraft ascend, Lu Yin stored the star essence skin away, which was worth at least 5,000 to 7,000 star essence. However, he hadn’t decided on whether or not he would sell it, as if he did sell it, another powerhouse on Ze Lin’s level might appear with this same suit. If the person turned out to be an enemy, then that would be a problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he was also unwilling to not sell it, as it represented an enormous fortune.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked around, as the pyrolyte ore in this area had been more or less completely mined out. He saw Hai Qiqi charge towards Kuang Wang and quickly gathered himself before leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ze Lin’s defeat had given the various major powers a deeper understanding of Lu Yin’s strength. Their common understanding at this point was that someone had to at least be in the top sixty of the Top 100 Rankings, or else they could simply forget about beating Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the younger generation, there were not that many Explorers in the top sixty of the Top 100 Rankings, and those few were scattered throughout the universe. However, the various great powers had some older Explorers with similar power levels, and those older people could possibly be the next batch sent to the planet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Lu Yin returned to the mountain range, he was received by Northgate Lie’s astounded gaze, and he also saw that Lily Anne had unexpectedly arrived.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Lie was wearing the star essence skin that Lu Yin had sold to Northline Flowzone while Northline Flowzone had made another skin and evidently given it to Lily Anne.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Lu, your battle has shocked everyone. From now on, you’re invincible among Limiteers. Congratulations, Brother Lu.” Lily Anne smiled at Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Lie looked at Lu Yin with complex emotions, as there was still a shock that had not left his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin smiled. “The universe is too big, and it’s too early to use the term ‘invincible.’”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since ancient times, I’ve never heard of any Limiteer that could rival Brother Lu’s strength. Even the Ten Arbiters might not have reached Brother Lu’s strength when they were Limiteers. Brother Lu will probably be recorded down in history,” Lily Anne praised.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rest were shocked, as “history” was a rather serious term. Countless people wanted to leave their names in history but were unable to, while it seemed that Lu Yin could already do so. At least, in the record books, no one had ever matched his strength while still a Limiteer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes changed.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">History? Has the strength that I’ve shown really reached the level of being recorded down in history?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The various great powers are now afraid to send some random nobody down,” Lily Anne said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s mind was jolted. With his own strength, he had changed the standards of what members the various powers could send down to Planet Pyrolyte. With his current strength, Lu Yin felt like he had reached a new level. No Limiteer was his opponent anymore. Ling Que? Mu Rong? No, not even someone placed rather highly on the Top 100 Rankings like Ze Lin was enough anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It hadn’t been too long ago since Lu Yin had looked up to the elites in the Great Yu Empire’s Yu Academy, then a bit later, to the Astral Combat Academy’s Area Masters, then the Realm Masters, and then to the genius freaks within the same generation as him. He had steadily surpassed them all, and he now stood at the peak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he thought of this, Lu Yin felt a ball of fire rise in his chest, and a faint green line appeared around his body. This was the sign of six-lined battle force, where the battle force gained a green outline.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lily Anne and Northgate Lie were stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What’s happening? Hold on, is he breaking through?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stretched out both of his hands, and he suddenly recalled the Sandmaster’s words from back then: battle force could be improved through cultivation, but it could also be improved through one’s spirit. Lu Yin previously had not held the ambition of looking down on everyone within the universe, and his battle force had been unable to improve. But now, he had defeated Ling Que, Mu Rong, and Ze Lin and had stunned the universe in the process. He had become an invincible Limiteer and experienced a new type of ambition, and his battle force had transformed accordingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the green lines only appeared for that instant before quickly vanishing. His breakthrough did not succeed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Lie subconsciously relaxed. Lu Yin was already so powerful, and if he made another breakthrough, then Northgate Lie would lose the courage to even attempt to catch up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Lu, that’s too unfortunate. You-” Lily Anne had not even finished speaking when Lu Yin leaped up and charged towards Pyrolyte Lake. Had he failed to breakthrough? No! It was just that his spirit wasn’t bold enough. He wanted to face his own strength now and reaffirm his beliefs in his own invincibility through battle. Right now, the most suitable opponents were those like Mu Rong and Ling Que, and the closest person to the mountain range was Ling Que, so Lu Yin was heading over to find him.</span></p>
