 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-3a6df93a-7fff-c04b-c5c6-602a8b73c242"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Battle force was a powerful strength that everyone was aware of, but it was difficult to cultivate, just like a domain. Currently, there were thousands of outstanding disciples from the younger generation on Planet Pyrolyte, but there were no more than a hundred who had comprehended battle force or a domain. This was so even despite the fact that all of those present were elite disciples from the various great powers, which went to show just how difficult comprehending battle force or a domain was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Long Yun’s six-lined battle force appeared, it caused the various great powers to feel their hearts turn heavy, as this was yet another suppressive strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes went wide as five-lined battle force twisted around his body. He was releasing all of his strength just to resist Long Yun’s six-lined battle force, as there was an enormous disparity in just one line of difference.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a whoosh, and Long Yun appeared right before Lu Yin after moving with extreme speed. He sliced down with his blade without any hesitation. Lu Yin’s eyes filled with star energy as he held the Giant Emperor’s third eye in his left hand, allowing him to use Secret Sidestep to easily dodge Long Yun’s attack. He simultaneously counterattacked with a palm just like against Ze Lin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The same attack that had defeated Ze Lin moved towards Long Yun, but he simply smiled. Instead of dodging, he swept his blade horizontally in reply. If Lu Yin’s attack landed on Long Yun, then his blade would also land on Lu Yin. This was a mutually destructive battle style, and it showed Long Yun’s extreme confidence in his own battle force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was still able to retreat since his Secret Sidestep guaranteed that Long Yun would not be able to cut him, leaving Lu Yin with what seemed to be a sure-win position. He believed that Long Yun was not so fast as to transcend Secret Sidestep, and at this moment, Lu Yin’s boldness surged. He did not want to retreat, as he felt that moving back would cause his spirit to decrease.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a bang, Long Yun’s abdomen forcibly endured Lu Yin’s Thirty Stacks Seventyfold Shockwave Palm, and the Explorer’s clothes were torn off as a palm print deeply imprinted itself onto his torso. Lu Yin’s chest was similarly struck by the sword, causing scarlet blood to spray onto the ground. The two combatants were each knocked back a hundred meters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun exhaled as he looked at his abdomen. There, he saw a deep palm imprint from which intense pain radiated out. His organs felt like they had been pulverized, and his six-lined battle force had already collapsed. He was astonished that a Limiteer could actually cause his six-lined battle force to collapse. If he took that attack again, then there was no doubt that he would lose, and he also understood why Ze Lin had not been able to withstand a single attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those who could cultivate their battle force to six lines would have decent physical strength, but even so, Lu Yin’s palm had nearly crippled Long Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Lu Yin was not much better off as the cut across his chest was rather deep. Not only had it sliced through his five-lined battle force, but it had also lacerated his physical body. If Mister Mu hadn’t helped him improve his physical strength to the pinnacle by allowing Lu Yin to undergo a transformation, then the blade would have cut him straight in two.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Through this exchange, they had mutually left a deep impression on the other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked at Long Yun, and his lips rose as his face betrayed his excitement. “No wonder it’s six-lined battle force. The intensity can’t even compare to five-lined battle force.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun exhaled and held his abdomen. “Do you really care about six-lined battle force?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes flashed, but he didn’t reply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun flexed his neck. “Six-lined battle force is indeed incomparable to five-lined battle force, and the disparity becomes greater the higher one goes. The limits of what you can withstand should be six-lined battle force, which means that this battle is over.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, the dark-gold radiance that previously shrouded his body was replaced by a green light while blue lines appeared on his blade and illuminated the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless were stunned, as this was seven-lined battle force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Long Yun’s true power. It turned out that he had been keeping his seven-lined battle force hidden.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the younger generation, there were very few who could cultivate their battle force to seven lines, as it was just too difficult. When Lu Yin had attained five-lined battle force, it had been back during the Astral Combat Tournament, but he had only felt signs of it breaking through to six lines just now. This showed just how difficult it was to improve one’s battle force, as Lu Yin had nearly improved his physical body to its extreme. Despite this, Long Yun had actually comprehended seven-lined battle force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, even the various major forces in outer space didn’t dare to believe their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mira was astonished as she looked at Planet Pyrolyte.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moore stepped out of a spacecraft and stared at Long Yun. He was a West San Dios Councilor and was ranked twelfth on the Top 100 Rankings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Avery also walked out of a spacecraft and stared at Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the Ross Empire’s spacecraft, a youth who had been sleeping suddenly opened his eyes and looked towards Planet Pyrolyte with a flabbergasted expression. The seven-lined battle force had illuminated the entire area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On Pyrolyte Mountain, Long Yun raised his blade and pointed it at Lu Yin. “Leave Planet Pyrolyte. I know that you can use Secret Sidestep technique, so my speed can't hope to catch up to you, but I can still destroy an entire area of the void. Can your Secret Sidestep technique guarantee that you’ll be able to avoid that? The range will be very great.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu and the others stared at Long Yun in shock, as the current Long Yun could rival the top fifty on the rankings; he had hidden himself much too deeply. Once he broke through to the Cruiser realm, his power would rise once again, and that breakthrough would even cause the front-ranking experts to grow nervous, as no one could guarantee that Long Yun would not be able to comprehend eight-lined battle force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once he successfully comprehended eight-lined battle force, Long Yun would have the strength to threaten even the top ten.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The universe’s top-notch powers were domain and battle force. Once reached the pinnacle in either one, one would obtain an immeasurable strength. This was the path for commoners to surpass cultivators with powerful innate gifts, and it was also a path to become a first-rate powerhouse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun had no innate gift. Instead, he had relied on his battle force to challenge numerous talented geniuses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one believed that Lu Yin could withstand Long Yun, as he definitely could not stop seven-lined battle force since six-lined battle force had already torn through his defense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, we’re in trouble. That’s seven-lined battle force. Humans are indeed insane! Just any random person can actually become so powerful,” the monkey gasped.</span></p>

Lu Yin raised his hand, almost able to touch it. Was this the strength seven-lined battle force? It was very powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you retreating or not?” Long Yun’s blade spun in the air. If Lu Yin refused to retreat, then Long Yun would use his sword to destroy the immediate region of the void, and this was what gave him his self-confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin grimaced. “I’m always one step behind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun was stumped, and he looked at the Limiteer, puzzled by his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rest were also lost. One step behind? What did that mean?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu’s brows raised. Could it be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin suddenly looked up, as the dark-gold radiance around him charged into the skies while green stripes twisted around him like ribbons, releasing a shockingly tyrannical wave. This was six-lined battle force. After receiving Long Yun’s attack, besides gaining a huge wound, he had also gained the harvest of comprehending six-lined battle force. His spirit had reached a new level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The various great powers in the heavens were speechless. This was also possible? Had this brat always been hiding his strength?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qichen’s brows leaped up. “This kid’s been trying to break through in his battle force! Little rascal, he was actually using Ling Que and the others to build up his confidence.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Sword Sect, Elder <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span> was so furious that his mustache nearly pointed upwards. “What a pity. If Long Yun had been just a little slower, then this rascal might not have broken through to six-lined battle force. Such a pity.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other Enlighters were also able to guess at what had just happened, and they all had strange expressions as they looked down at Planet Pyrolyte. Long Yun’s arrival was supposed to be a watershed event and herald the change of control over the mountain range, but he had actually helped Lu Yin upgrade his battle force. Now, there was no Limiteer who was Lu Yin’s opponent, maybe not even in the Neoverse. After all, five and six-lined battle force were completely different levels of strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun blankly stared at Lu Yin. “Did you just break through?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded and smiled. “Many thanks to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun forced a smile onto his face, but he quickly regained his state of mind. “The higher battle force goes, the more difficult it is to cultivate. Similarly, the difference also becomes greater. Six and seven-lined battle force are two entirely different concepts. The question still stands: will you retreat or no?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin raised his hand, feeling the power of six-lined battle force for himself. He looked back at Long Yun. “If I still only had five-lined battle force, there would be no chance of me being able to stand against you, but with six-lined battle force, things are no longer as certain. I might not be able to beat you, but I can at least protect myself. The reaction time that my Secret Sidestep technique gives me combined with my six-lined battle force makes for a defense sturdy enough to receive your blow, as your blade’s destructive ability is not that strong yet. There’s no need to fight anymore. I’m sorry, but things will end here today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin charged to the west with Flash Step; he did not want to fight anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun instantly sliced out with his blade while also targeting the void in the area. He wanted to detain Lu Yin and completely put an end to this danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s Flash Step and Secret Sidestep techniques were not enough to escape from the range of Long Yun’s sword since the Explorer was using a battle technique. Long Yun was now serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin turned his back to the west and fled. When Long Yun’s sword qi approached him, he raised his hand that was covered with six-lined battle force and struck out at full force. His palm made contact with the sword qi 10,000 meters away from him in an explosion of sparks. The void directly shattered with countless cracks. The scenery on both the ground and the sky collapsed, and fresh blood dripped down from Lu Yin’s palm. His six-lined battle force had only barely been able to withstand the sword attack, and it had even been breached at the last moment. Fortunately, Lu Yin managed to escape in the end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even sword qi reinforced with seven-lined battle force was not enough to detain Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pyrolyte Mountain fell silent, and the Sword Sect disciples all looked at Long Yun with adoration. The moment Lu Yin revealed himself on this planet, he had been like a mountain crushing down upon them, but now, an expert on their side had finally appeared who could defeat the monster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun fell silent. Defeat? Not necessarily, as Lu Yin’s escape had been rather prompt. His many years of battle experience allowed him to sense a faintly dangerous aura from Lu Yin’s body. This aura had made Long Yun instinctively not give chase, as this person had not been defeated yet; he still had trump cards hidden up his sleeves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was annoying. When had a Limiteer become so hard to deal with? Was it really to the extent where not even seven-lined battle force was enough?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun put his sword away, and his carefree expression returned. He looked down at his ruined clothes and immediately changed, though his new clothes were identical to his old outfit. He then looked at Liu Shaoqiu and greeted him with a wave, “Yo, junior.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu looked seriously at Long Yun with a thoughtful expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun’s brows rose up somewhat cautiously. “Junior, what are you thinking about? Let me tell you this straight up. Senior will definitely not fight you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu’s eyes flashed, but then he walked over to Long Yun and bowed solemnly. “Senior, please guide me on how to improve my battle force.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun frowned and grabbed his head while looking rather distraught. “Junior, you really don’t know how fortunate you are.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu continued to bend at the waist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun turned around. “In the entire Sword Sect of hundreds of thousands of disciples, only you and her have inherited the Thirteen Swords. She’s on a whole different level of abnormal, so we don’t need to even mention her. And you? Since you’ve inherited the Thirteen Swords, you should be first in your generation: invincible. And yet, you’ve lost your way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu was puzzled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun sighed. “You’ve lost a battle, and you believe that your loss to Lu Yin is because of the Thirteen Swords and not because of you yourself. This is why you want to learn battle force—to reinforce the Thirteen Swords with it and challenge Lu Yin again. You think that if you comprehend battle force, you’ll be able to win, right?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu did not deny his senior’s words, as those had indeed been his thoughts. Long Yun’s and Lu Yin’s battle force had lit a fire within him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun shook his head and he forced a smile onto his face. “Honestly, if someone is able to inherit the Thirteen Swords, why would they be willing to cultivate battle force?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu’s body trembled.</span></p>
