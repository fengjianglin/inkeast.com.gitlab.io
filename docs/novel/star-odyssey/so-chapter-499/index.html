She had never strayed far from Lu Yin’s side on Planet Pyrolyte. When she saw how Lu Yin was staring at Zhuo Daynight, she quickly asked, “What are you in a daze about? Let’s hurry up and leave! There are more people coming after us!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin grabbed Hai Qiqi while also still holding onto Zhuo Daynight, rushed into the sky and continued moving away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people behind them wanted to give chase, but none of them could catch up since Lu Yin’s speed was just too fast.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even if this person isn’t a match for Ling Que, just based on his ability to block the Que's Mighty Slash and his speed, he’s still shown enough strength to climb straight to the top,” someone commented.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one disagreed since Lu Yin had truly demonstrated enough strength to be regarded this highly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At Pyrolyte Lake, Ling Que had killed many people from the Daynight clan. He had severely injured Zhanlong Daynight, and he had also almost killed Nightqueen Yanqing. The Daynight clan didn’t dare tarry any longer and hurriedly retreated from Pyrolyte Lake. The lake had now officially been occupied by the Wen family.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This battle fully embodied the horror of invincible powerhouses. Just as Mu Rong had helped the Sword Sect take control of Pyrolyte Mountain, Pyrolyte Lake had similarly been taken over by just Ling Que himself. If any of the four unparalleled Limiteers made an appearance, then only the other three were able to stop them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And of those four, none of the other three could stop Lu Yin. This was what everyone was thinking, but unfortunately, Lu Yin had not seemed to come.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone left Pyrolyte Lake and waited for the Wen family to arrive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daylight stood up. He had been seriously injured by Ling Que, but he had recovered from his injury very quickly. Many people called him a freak, and even Ling Que raised a brow at how this person’s recovery was stronger than his own.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To the north of Pyrolyte Lake, Lu Yin was carrying Hai Qiqi while tightly holding onto Zhuo Daynight as he moved at a great speed. He didn’t know where he should go, but he knew that he needed to find a place for them to rest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked down at Zhuo Daynight. The wound between her eyebrows had gradually closed itself, shocking Lu Yin. Could she really be healed? Such a thing was unbelievable as she had received a fatal injury.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi exclaimed, “She’s not dead?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked in front of them. With his current speed, not even Ling Que could catch up to them. He had been fleeing for half a day already, so they should be far away from Pyrolyte Lake by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It would have taken them several days to traverse such a distance if he hadn’t used his top speed. Or to put it more simply, if he had headed northeast from Pyrolyte Lake instead of north, then he would have been drawing quite close to Pyrolyte Mountain by now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, this place looks really familiar,” Hai Qiqi blurted out in a surprised tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked at the mountain range ahead of them, and his eyes flashed. This mountain range was where the two of them had first landed in the middle of a bunch of cultivators fighting. In the end, Lu Yin had taken control of the location and had given it over to the group from Northline Flowzone. He didn’t think that they would have inadvertently circled back to this place, but he soon realized that this place, Pyrolyte Mountain, and Pyrolyte Lake formed a large triangle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without giving the matter too much thought, Lu Yin suddenly felt that Zhuo Daynight, who was still in his arms, had become a little strange. When he had first started carrying her, Zhuo Daynight had given him a rather immaterial feeling, as if her body was empty and actually an illusion. It had felt like he wasn’t holding her at all, but she had definitely been in his arms the entire time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin and Hai Qiqi touched down on the mountain range. Northgate Gang and the others shot suspicious looks towards Lu Yin as he blasted a hole in the ground and continued moving deeper underground. When he felt it was suitable, he hurriedly set Zhuo Daynight down and looked at her in surprise. At that moment, he noticed that Zhuo Daynight’s hair color had changed. &nbsp;It was now completely silver, and her entire body was shrouded in white light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The white light seemed gentle, but it also felt ancient, and it was constantly changing. There was a sense of immemorial time spanning endless ages. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What’s happening? Is this the true effects of that white fruit? Wasn’t it supposed to just heal?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqiqi also looked at Zhuo Daynight in surprise, her face full of confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, she’s glowing,” the Ghost Monkey murmured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin pulled Hai Qiqi out of the cave that he had made. “Go and play by yourself for now, but you’re not allowed to leave this mountain range.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi was dissatisfied, but she did not kick up any further fuss with Lu Yin. She had realized that Lu Yin was in a bad mood and already guessed that the woman he had rescued might be someone he liked. Thus, she didn’t make a scene.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight’s situation could only be left to fate. Meanwhile, Lu Yin looked at the burrow and muttered, “If you die, I will have that bitch, Nightqueen Yanqing, join you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This mountain range was occupied by people from Northline Flowzone, so no outsiders showed up, and Northgate Gang and the others did not disturb Lu Yin either.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi wandered about the mountain range for a while before returning with a bitter look on her face. Planet Pyrolye’s geology was unusual, and the planet was especially dry. There weren’t any animals or plants at this location. In fact, it couldn’t even be considered a mountain range as it was more of a mound. There was nothing special about this place at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She wanted to leave, but if Lu Yin didn’t agree, then she would be stuck here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were times when Lu Yin felt curious about what the Sea King had said to Hai Qiqi that made her not leave on her own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It didn’t take long for Pyrolyte Lake to be occupied by the Wen family. Before Ling Que arrived at Pyrolyte Lake, Wen Qian’er and the others had been playing hide-and-seek with the Daynight clan. One was the seeker while the other did their best to hide. They had only been able to move to Pyrolyte Lake after Ling Que defeated the Daynight clan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qian’er felt very sorry for Ling Que, as the rest of them weren’t strong at all. However, Ling Que didn’t care. His thoughts were solely focused on that person who had stopped his Que’s Mighty Slash with a single hand. Had that really been because of an innate gift? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking to the north, Ling Que really wanted to go find that person. However he didn’t know where that person had fled to, and that mysterious person had moved so fast that he likely wouldn’t be able to catch up anyways.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thought that someone could stop his Que's Mighty Slash made Ling Que feel uneasy. He suddenly thought of Lu Yin, but it surely couldn’t be him! He shook his head.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Probably not</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">. Lu Yin had never revealed his innate gift, and Ling Que had asked around about Lu Yin but never heard about him possessing an innate gift that could stop his Que's Mighty Slash. As for Lu Yin’s physical strength, Ling Que shook his head. Just physical strength alone shouldn’t be able to accomplish such a feat. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew very well the power of his Que's Mighty Slash. Lu Yin could avoid or block it, but it was impossible for him to catch it with just two fingers. If Lu Yin could do something like that, then he wouldn’t have fought so hard against Mu Rong, and that person wouldn’t have been hurt by his Que's Mighty Slash while escaping.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Ling Que thought of the last moment during Lu Yin’s fight with Mu Rong. When the shepherd boy’s song had rang out, Ling Que had been too far away from the two combatants to fully experience the enormous physical power that Lu Yin had unleashed, and he only knew that it had been terrifying. If he had used that strength, then could he have stopped his Que's Mighty Slash? Ling Que didn’t know what to think.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, he wanted to go find Mu Rong so that he could figure out if Lu Yin’s full strength would be able to catch his Que's Mighty Slash. If he could indeed do such a feat, then that person was absolutely Lu Yin, and the bit where he had been injured by Que’s Mighty Slash must have been nothing more than an act. Otherwise, it would imply that some strange powerhouse had just appeared on Planet Pyrolyte.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Atop the mountain range, Lu Yin had stayed near the burrow for several days now. During these few days, the cultivators of Northbound Flowzone had discovered something strange: whenever they closed their eyes to rest, all they saw was a vast expanse of white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The predominant color of Planet Pyrolyte was a dark, dusky red, and there was no white anywhere. However, every time they rested, without fail, they now saw an infinite whiteness, which was extremely strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi also saw the whiteness, and she became so nervous that she approached Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, Lu Yin had also experienced this phenomenon. Not only had he seen it, he even knew what was causing it. This white light was the exact same white light currently covering Zhuo Daynight’s body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stared at the burrow in amazement. What was happening to Zhuo Daynight that was able to affect everyone around her?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Monkey, you really don’t know?” Lu Yin asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ghost Monkey felt helpless. “Seventh Bro, I’m just a Limiteer who’s been cultivating for a bit more than twenty years. How can I know everything? Even if you ask an Enlighter powerhouse, they might not be able to explain this phenomenon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two days had passed, but Zhuo Daynight was still radiating white light from inside the cave. The wound she had received on her forehead from the Que’s Mighty Slash had healed, but a vertical scar remained. It wasn’t overly conspicuous, but anyone could see it. Her now silvery-grey hair fluttered, giving her a gentle aura.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Over the past two days, not only had everyone seen white when they closed their eyes, but sometimes, they also still saw white even when their eyes opened. This change had made Northgate Gang and the others panic, as they felt like they were being targeted. Northgate Gang deliberately went to find Lu Yin and wanted to look around the cave, but Lu Yin merely feigned confusion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, after three days, the white light disappeared for everyone. They all felt relieved, but the three strange days had left them all rather haggard. Even Hai Qiqi looked pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the cave, the white light had disappeared from around Zhuo Daynight’s body. Her silvery-grey hair had also returned to its former black and white appearance. In fact, everything about her had returned to her former appearance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin walked into the burrow and stared at Zhuo Daynight. He squatted down and studied her carefully. She was breathing, and she was clearly alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight suddenly opened her eyes and stared back at Lu Yin. Her eyes were filled with surprise and confusion, but then, they finally changed into a grateful and complicated expression. “Thank you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re welcome,” Lu Yin replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why did you come to Planet Pyrolyte?” Zhuo Daynight straightened herself as her eyes turned dull. She looked at Lu Yin without any of the joy that one would expect to see from someone who had just come back to life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin raised his brows. “You know who I am?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight looked at him. “Should I not know?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How do you know?” Lu Yin was surprised, as he had obviously disguised himself quite well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight did not respond, and she instead silently touched the scar on her forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin thought that she was concerned about her appearance, so he comforted her. “Don’t worry. This sort of scar can be easily removed.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight quietly said, “There’s no need to get rid of it. I’ll keep it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin didn’t say anything else and stood up. He stretched out a hand towards Zhuo Daynight, who didn’t hesitate to reach up, grab his right hand, and let him help her up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I thought that I was dead for sure. Just what did you feed me?” Zhuo Daynight asked curiously. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin shrugged. “It was a strange fruit that I received after a lockbreaking session. One of my mentors told me that it was filled with vital energy, so I tried it on you. Honestly, I didn’t expect it to save you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight looked at Lu Yin with a complicated expression. “Why did you save me?”</span></p>

Right, why&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">had&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">he saved her? He didn’t know himself. All he knew was that when he had seen Zhuo Daynight fall into a critical situation on that video, he had felt an irresistible impulse to come. He had come to Planet Pyrolyte for Zhuo Daynight’s sake and also to find Zhanlong Daynight and figure out what was happening on Shenwu Continent. No, his primary motivation concerning Shenwu Continent was Ming Yan.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How strange—why is it all because of women?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she saw that Lu Yin did not answer her, Zhuo Daynight hung her head. “I owe you a life as well an incredible favor.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was puzzled. “A favor?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes brightened. “Is it related to your hair color?”</span></p>
