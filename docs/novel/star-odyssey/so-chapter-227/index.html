 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

All of a sudden, a black figure rushed out from the hole in the ground and attacked two people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nobody could have foreseen this. There had been a war spirit hidden deep underground. During the previous battles, it had not been affected at all, but during Lu Yin and Nightqueen Yanqing’s, the ground had been damaged too much, freeing it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black war spirit used its star energy to materialize a long staff that it grasped in its hands. As it swept out, the staff thrust the entire area into shadow even as more black shadows emanated out from the staff. This move was both a domain and a battle technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up in the sky, one of the academy mentors was shocked. “That’s the battle technique of Astral-2’s leader from centuries ago.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the shrill sound of howling wind, Lu Yin and Nightqueen Yanqing’s figures flitted past the war spirit, which froze before crumbling apart. Even the shadows from its staff had vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Quite a few of the spectators felt their scalps go numb. The war spirit of the former Astral-2 leader couldn’t even last for a second! The disparity between it and Lu Yin and Nightqueen Yanqing was just too large.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thud thud!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing’s breathing was labored, and a line of blood was flowing from the corner of her mouth as she glared at Lu Yin. He ruthlessly mocked, “So, is this all the Nightking clan amounts to?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing bellowed in rage and tried to kick him, but Lu Yin didn’t even bother dodging. With a flick of his wrist, he slammed her into the ground and stared into her eyes. “Nightking Zhenwu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing’s pupils shrank to the size of pinholes. “You’ve heard of the Ten Arbiters’ names?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was startled by this unexpected response. “He’s one of the Ten Arbiters?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing looked at Lu Yin in confusion before snickering. “So you didn’t know? Nightking Zhenwu is a genius beyond any we’ve ever seen. He’s one of the Ten Arbiters and my older brother as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin narrowed his eyes. It did make sense that the strongest family in the universe, the Nightking clan, would produce a member of the Ten Arbiters. He had only asked about this person out of curiosity, but he had unexpectedly managed to find out that he was one of the Ten Arbiters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you have the guts to kill me? Can you even win? I’m the princess of the Nightking clan and Nightking Zhenwu’s younger sister—the younger sister of one of the Ten Arbiters,” Nightqueen Yanqing provokingly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin shot her a look of contempt. “And here I thought that you were strong. I never expected that you would have such a pathetic side. Regardless, it’s over.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After saying that, he used Nine Stacks, Seventeen-Fold Shockwave Palm with a single hand to crush both the ground and the girl into dust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone went silent as they watched Lu Yin slowly rise into the air. He had won the match.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, everyone from Astral-10 started cheering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Da was so excited that he nearly started jumping out of joy. There was now hope for his academy newspaper to reach an unprecedented level of sales! He watched Lu Yin with passionate eyes. This was a person who he needed to keep following, as Lu Yin would definitely be the subject of more shocking news in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Starsibyl and a few others gave Lu Yin meaningful looks. Only now did they truly acknowledge and treat him as an equal with the same level of strength as them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up in the sky, a dozen mentors exchanged glances, the shock in their gazes still present. This Astral Combat Tournament had completely exceeded all of their expectations. Thankfully, a decision had already been made that the tournament would end before the semifinals. It wouldn’t be good for the Human Domain if the final four’s true abilities were exposed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In front of their screens, numerous people stared at Lu Yin’s figure in shock. He was a Melder from Astral-10 who had cultivated five lines of battle force. He was incredibly powerful, but at the same time, he was merely a nobody from the Outerverse who had managed to achieve something that even people from the Innerverse’s most powerful organizations were incapable of accomplishing. Who ever said that miracles don’t exist in space?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire population of Earth was cheering ecstatically. The people might not understand the full implications of what had happened, but even they could tell that this last battle had been on a whole other level. After all, it had been a fierce battle between two people who were both qualified to enter the final four.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On Saint Dios, Wendy Yushan was just as shocked as everyone else. Lu Yin was merely a Melder, but once he became a Limiteer, or better yet, an Explorer, he would definitely rise into the heavens and be qualified to challenge the Top 100 Rankings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Innerverse, within a dark room, a wine glass shattered into tiny shards. “What a piece of trash.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind the young man, Liu Shaoge kept his eyes trained on Lu Yin’s figure on the screen as a dark glint flickered across them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Lifeseek Realm, outside the arena plains, all of the students looked into the sky. This was the first time that an Astral Combat Academy mentor had come out and made an appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Studying in the Astral Combat Academy came with a lot of freedom. For example, the battles in the teleportation arena and the trial zones took place without any guidance or supervision. The mentors would generally only give a small bit of guidance to the students, and many students might not even have the chance to ever interact with any of the mentors. Rather than calling them mentors, they were more like the Astral Combat Academy’s guardians.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All students, listen up! This is a joint decision that was made by the Mentor Association of the Astral Combat Academy and the Ten Arbiter’s Council. The tournament will go on a hiatus until further notice. Additionally, the Astral Combat Academy’s students must respond to a summons and go to the Human Domain’s warfront. The final four will be the leaders of this team, and they will also oversee these teams at the Human Domain’s border while accumulating contributions for humanity. The dates of the final matches will be announced later.” The mentor then repeated himself. “ The tournament will go on a hiatus until further notice. Additionally, the Astral Combat Academy’s students must respond to a summons and go to the Human Domain’s warfront. The final four will be the leaders of this team, and they will also oversee these teams at the Human Domain’s border while accumulating contributions for humanity. The dates of the final matches will be announced later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The students were astonished by what they had just heard; the tournament was going to end just like that?!</span></p>

They had just found out who the final four were before the tournament was indefinitely postponed! This was terrible news.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin sighed. It was over. The Trialmaster had already hinted to him that this would be the last round of the tournament. As for when the tournament’s semifinals and finals would really be held, it depended on what the higher-ups decided. However, what would happen to the rewards from the sponsors? He remembered that the Nalan family had donated a harmless sourcebox that was suitable for a medium-ranked Lockbreaker to unlock. It was also rumored that there were also many powerful battle techniques available. Many people had joined the tournament and even the academies just for these rewards.</span></p>

She was very gentle and her voice caused people to unconsciously relax when they heard it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin swung his arms around. “I’m pretty beat from fighting so much over the past few days. I’ll probably use this time to relax a bit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Grandini snickered. “Relax? It seems that you’ve never been to the Human Domain’s warfront before. People at the Explorer realm and above die there everyday, and you want to relax there?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was shocked. “We’re actually going to the warfront?”</span></p>

With our strength, it’s very possible. At the very least, we won’t lose easily, even to Explorers,” Han Chong added on.</span></p>

Nightqueen Yanqing is a very petty woman. You beat her, so you should be careful of her from now on.” After that, she waved her hand and exited the Lifeseek Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Chong nodded in agreement. “Yeah, she’s very petty.” He also left after saying those words.</span></p>

Are you asking whether we’re classmates or friends?”</span></p>

What a pity—I don’t get to rip you apart.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was rendered speechless by her shocking words. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Grandini snorted. “It’s hard for a Mavis family member to marry outside the family, so what do you think I meant?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin rolled his eyes before leaving the Liveseek Realm as well. When he opened his eyes again, he saw that Xia Luo and the rest had already left the trial zone mountain. Hui Daynight was the only one who had stayed behind, and he was looking at Lu Yin with a complicated expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin returned the look and asked rather detachedly, “What’s up?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hui Daynight shook his head before leaving the mountain as well.</span></p>

Unfortunately, the Nalan spacecraft had already left, and he wasn’t able to bid farewell to Madam Nalan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, he received a message from his gadget telling him to go to the treasury to meet Old Cai.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old Cai.” Lu Yin respectfully bowed to the mentor when he reached the treasury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Cai looked Lu Yin up and down with evident surprise. “You’re quite something, kiddo.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin smiled. “I just got lucky.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Cai nodded and did not prod any further. “There’s been a summoning from the warfront. The final four of the tournament are to lead the rest. Get some rest and head out tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was surprised. “This soon?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Cai rolled his eyes in annoyance. “It’s a summoning from the warfront, so it’s obviously going to happen soon. Did you think that this was just another mission?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So where am I going?” Lu Yin asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Cai answered, “To the battlefront at the border of the <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Erudite&nbsp;</span>Flowzone, Planet Conan.” Then, he seemed to remember something and tossed a cosmic ring to Lu Yin. “This is your reward for reaching the final four. You’re quite lucky.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes lit up. He was actually just about to ask about the reward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t bother checking it. There’s five hundred thousand star crystals and a harmless sourcebox inside,” Old Cai said with a slightly envious and annoyed tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Five hundred thousand star crystals wasn’t much, but Lu Yin was quite surprised by the sourcebox.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old Cai, who provided this sourcebox?” Lu Yin asked even though he had his guesses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Cai snickered. “It’s from the Nalan family. By the way, kid, since when did you become friends with that rich Nalan widow? This reward is meant for the winner, but she gave it to you now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Madam Nalan’s face appeared in Lu Yin’s mind and his heartbeat sped up. But after seeing Old Cai’s thick beard, he replied, “She’s my benefactor. It’s all thanks to her that I managed to return here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that so? Well, whatever, your personal issues have nothing to do with the academy. Though I do need to remind you that she has connections with the Sword Sect, so don’t overdo it,” Old Cai said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin didn’t really care since he had known about this since a long time ago. That was the only way Madam Nalan would have known about Liu Shaoqiu, and she most likely wouldn’t have given Liu Xiaoyun a ride if she didn’t have a good relationship with the Sword Sect. However, this had nothing to do with Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“By the way, speaking of the Sword Sect, a letter arrived yesterday from them. Apparently, the sect leader is willing to take you in as a personal disciple. What do you think? Do you want to go there?” Old Cai asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was startled. “The Sword Sect’s leader? Become his personal disciple?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Cai nodded and grinned as he stroked his beard. “Yes, you’d be a personal disciple of the sect leader. That would mean that you’d have the same status as Liu Shaoqiu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was shocked. The Sword Sect was a very powerful organization in the Innerverse that controlled the First Flowzone and was far more powerful than Myriad Swords Peak. The moment he became a personal disciple of the Sword Sect, his status would surpass even Wendy Yushan’s, who was from the Myriad Swords Peak. This was an extremely tempting offer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Cai continued stroking his beard as he observed Lu Yin’s reaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin pondered over it for quite a while, but then, he sighed. “Forget it. The Sword Sect isn’t for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Cai was surprised to hear this response. “Think it through, kiddo. That’s the Sword Sect you’re talking about! The Sword Sect from the First Flowzone. If you agree, you’d instantly become a part of the rich and powerful in the Innerverse. With one word, you’d be able to make the master of any Outerverse territory bow down to you, and your status would vastly eclipse what you currently have as King Zishan. Are you sure that you don’t want this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin laughed wryly before responding, “Please stop tempting me, Old Cai. It’s not that easy to say ‘no.’”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Cai sized him up before seriously asking, “Tell me why.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s very simple. The Sword Sect just isn’t suitable for me. The reason why they value me is probably because they saw that I was immune to Liu Shaoqiu’s Third Sword. In reality, other than that, I’m worth nothing to the Sword Sect even though I have five-lined battle force. They’re an organization that has even raised a disciple who became one of the Ten Arbiters. If I go, I’ll just be someone for them to study. Besides, their training environment doesn’t fit me,” Lu Yin honestly answered.</span></p>
