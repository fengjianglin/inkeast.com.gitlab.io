It turns out that the Sea King is looking to select a son-in-law. He wants his beloved daughter to get married, so this has turned into a huge matter. Powerful organizations from all over the Innerverse have sent young men to participate, hoping &nbsp;for them to marry the Sea King’s daughter and build a relationship with the Sea King.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s this got to do with us?” Coco was bewildered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Pao grinned. “Do you think that the Sea King would let anything happen to his daughter’s fiancé?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you saying that you want to participate in the selection?” Lu Yin was shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Pao nodded. “I’ve heard that there’ll be people conducting selection tests at fixed distances along the Starfall Sea’s entrance. As long as a person qualifies, they’ll receive the Sea King’s protection and be taken to the Sea King's Dome. This is our chance to escape! With the Sea King’s protection, forget Feng Mo—even if the entirety of the Relentless Slayers come after us, they won’t dare to try anything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group muttered amongst themselves; this was a good idea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, there’s one bit that’s rather troublesome,” Big Pao continued in a low tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They all looked at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Pao adjusted his hair and explained in a melancholic fashion, “The Sea King is selecting a son-in-law, which means that whoever is selected will become a member of his family and will have to stay at the Sea King’s Dome from then on. I can’t accept such a thing, but you guys do need to be safe. So I have to come up with a way to qualify to participate in the selection while not actually being selected as the Sea King’s son-in-law. It’s tough.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Pao smacked his forehead.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How embarrassing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Coco widened her eyes, appearing very innocent. “Senior Big Pao, your confidence caught us unprepared.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was amused, as he remembered that Big Pao had been like this from the very first time they had met.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Michelle’s tone turned cold. “You don’t have to worry. You won’t even qualify.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Pao’s mouth twisted. “Stop joking, I’m so handsome! How could I not qualify? I need to tell you guys something: there are two ways of qualifying, and you just need to pass one.” He paused for a moment before continuing, saying, “The first criteria is strength, as the Sea King doesn’t like weaklings. Furthermore, the applicants need to be twenty five years old or younger, and their strength has to be close to that of a Cruiser.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The students were shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zora could not help herself from saying, “There’s barely anyone who meets those qualifications in the entire universe! Brother Lu is the only one out of all of us who satisfies those qualifications.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Pao replied, “Don’t worry, that’s why there’s still a second method.” His lips perked up at this point. “The second is to be handsome! The Sea King has declared that good looks can make up for all other shortcomings.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd was stunned. Such a thing was possible? Physical attractiveness? That was important in a normal family, but this was the Sea King’s family!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is the Sea King that superficial?” Lu Yin was astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s just how it is! As long as you’re handsome enough, you can be qualified to participate in the Sea King’s son-in-law selection even if you have practically no strength. Now you guys should understand why I’m so confident. No one can compare to my looks!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Coco blinked. “Brother Big Pao, don’t worry. There’s absolutely no way that you’ll qualify.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Pao rolled his eyes. “Little brat, you’ve got no taste.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Based on those criteria, I’m also very confident,” Little Pao said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Blind confidence,” Zora mocked ruthlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s still self-confidence.” Little Pao’s expression grew even more serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Yue and Zhao Yilong could not help but look at each other; were&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">they&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">good-looking?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin did not like discussing such things. He was a bit above average, but he was definitely nowhere close to Xia Luo’s looks. A large number of people could beat him by a mile in terms of physical appearance. “Let’s investigate again. If the Sea King’s really looking for a son-in-law, then this could indeed be one path for us forward.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Lu, aren’t you confident? You’re very handsome.” Coco looked at Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Michelle scoffed. She would never forget Lu Yin’s words when he had said that she could not compare to her sister. That was unforgivable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A harsh sound stung Lu Yin’s ears. “That- Wha- everyone appreciates beauty differently. Some prefer refined looks, and some like burly muscles. Perhaps the Sea King’s daughter has unconventional tastes. It’s best if we find out more first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, let’s go. The closest selection site is on the neighboring seaweed strand. With our speed, we can get there in half an hour. In the meantime, let’s leave our spacecraft here to get the coating put on,” Big Pao suggested.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group stood up and glanced at Feng Mo before heading straight for the nearby seaweed strand that Big Pao had mentioned.&nbsp;</span></p>

He immediately followed after them, but his path was blocked before he had walked for more than a few steps. It was the bartender. “Sir, please pay your bill.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo pointed at Lu Yin’s group. “They ordered this drink for me. I didn’t even touch it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bartender’s face sank. “Please pay up, and also pay for your friends’ portion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo was enraged. It was no wonder why that brat had ordered a glass of wine for him and why they had waited for him at the bar. Their group even dared to leave without paying, all so that he was forced to foot their bill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo thought of just leaving, but this was the entrance of the Starfall Sea, and he knew the consequences of such an action. Although he was a Hunter, that was not considered very powerful within the Sea King's Dome. He was left with no choice but to pay the bill before rushing after the youths. He could not let this bunch of brats escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cultivators were allowed to fly above the seaweed, as it was not prohibited. The seaweed covered a large area, but only took Lu Yin’s group about ten minutes to arrive at the other strand of seaweed with their speed. The selection site for the Sea King’s son-in-law selection was located about ten minutes away once they arrived at the correct seaweed strand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked at the surrounding buildings and sighed emotionally. Anything could exist in the universe. There were so many buildings around that, if one did not look at the ground, it would be impossible to tell that everything had been built atop seaweed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was suddenly curious about what lay beneath the seaweed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo leisurely followed behind the group, not even bothering to conceal his killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin turned around and coincidentally exchanged glances with Feng Mo. “Did Deep Crimson Hall commission you to waste your time here? If you can’t complete the mission, then you will lose everything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo sneered. “You can’t escape.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes narrowed. “I can guarantee you this. If you capture me, a great catastrophe will befall your Relentless Slayers.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No matter—that can be discussed after you’ve been captured.” Feng Mo did not feel threatened. If the Relentless Slayers could be intimidated, they would have been disbanded long ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lulu looked at Feng Mo. “How much did the Deep Crimson Hall commission you for? I’ll pay double.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo looked at her with disdain, clearly not believing her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lulu grew annoyed. “Hey, beggar, I’m talking to you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo got angry. “Brat, watch your tongue!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You dare to provoke me? I’m Lulu Mavis!” Lulu was proud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo was at a loss for a moment, and then he looked at her in astonishment. “You’re from the Mavis family?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lulu raised her head proudly. “Speak, how much is the commission? I’ll pay double.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo no longer dared to underestimate Lulu. He suddenly remembered that this girl had paid for the coating for the group’s small Aurora while they had escaped from Deep Crimson Planet in just a regular spacecraft. That meant that they had upgraded to a radiant-grade Aurora while fleeing. If they could change to such an expensive spacecraft at whim, especially at such a young age, then it was indeed very likely that one of them was a Mavis.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He definitely could not offend the Mavis family. They Relentless Slayers might not care about the Daynight clan, as they could hide from them, but there was no way that they could ignore the Mavis family. After all, that family owned the universe’s banks, and a large amount of the Relentless Slayers’ wealth was held in Mavis Bank accounts. Although the bank could not freeze their accounts, they could absolutely track whenever the accounts were accessed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo decided that he could not touch this girl, so he instead decided to ignore her. The Relentless Slayers had their own rules, and their members would not be so easily swayed by a target.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lulu snorted when she saw Feng Mo ignore her. “Beggar.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo’s eyes narrowed in fury, but he did not reveal his emotions. Compared to the Mavis family, the Relentless Slayers, even in its entirety, could only be considered as poor. Although it was unfair, that was life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Feng Mo, it wasn’t smart to finish this mission. You’ll offend both the Mavis family and the Daynight clan at the same time,” Michelle commented indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo’s eyes turned cold. “And who are you again?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Michelle did not bother replying, but Coco leaped at the chance. “She’s Michelle, from the Ten Arbiters Council. She’s the younger sister of the Red Lotus, Witchbow Mira.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo’s eyelids twitched once again, as there was another kid here who he could not afford to provoke. Mira was still within reason. He had heard of this woman who had been on the Top 100 Rankings before and knew that she had a powerful innate gift. However, it wasn’t enough to threaten him. However, behind Mira stood the Ten Arbiters. Although it was unknown which one was her backer, each one of the Ten Arbiters represented incomparably enormous powers. As soon as they approached the Chaos Flowzone, he would be out of luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like the Daynight clan, the Relentless Slayers might not be afraid of such a group, but they also knew that if a power like the Daynight clan was determined enough to seek out the Relentless Slayers, their assassination group would suffer heavy losses. It was best to just avoid provoking such enemies whenever possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Alright, I won’t touch this brat either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Michelle then said, “Feng Mo, it’s best to be clear about who you’re dealing with.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo grew sullen, and he looked at Lu Yin. He had already looked up all the information he could about Lu Yin while chasing the brats through space, and Lu Yin’s many titles and status were the biggest reason why it was important to capture him alive. Such a person could not be killed by Feng Mo, or else things would become very complicated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no need to say anything more. Those two have to die, and I am going to take this person away.” Feng Mo did not want to exchange any more nonsense with these youngsters. The more he listened, the more he realized that these kids had incredible backgrounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stopped Michelle from speaking further and he then looked at Feng Mo. “I must warn you: each and every one of us in this group is not simple, even including the two that you want to kill—they have Astral-10 behind them. Think about things for yourself, just for that insignificant Deep Crimson Hall’s commission, you’ll offend the Mavis family, Daynight clan, Astral Combat Academy, Lockbreaker Society, Ten Arbiters Council, Windrift Hall, Myriad Swords Peak, Vastdearth Sect, Shamrock Enterprises, ancient Xia family, and ancient Lu family. Think about whether it’s truly worth it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s words stunned not only Feng Mo, but also Michelle and the others. They had not realized that their group represented so many powers, and each one sounded rather terrifying. Hold on, what were the ancient Xia and Lu families?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo’s eyelids twitched. “Brat, don’t think that you can defend yourself just by making up a few names.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin sneered and replied, “Think about it.” He then turned to leave so that no one would question him any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, Feng Mo truly hesitated. He had not heard of the ancient Xia and Lu families before, but they sounded rather grand, as if they possessed some kind of ancient inheritance. It was very possible that they were families with legal primeval surnames, just like the Sword Sect’s Liu family. Feng Mo had heard of all the others, but what did Shamrock Enterprises, Myriad Swords Peak, Windrift Hall, and the Vastdearth Sect have to do with these kids? Why were there so many organizations all of a sudden?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If these people really had backgrounds that involved so many powers, then Feng Mo truly felt like the commission wouldn’t be worth all this trouble. However, he had also never considered killing all of these people; he was only focused on three of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right, it would be fine as long as the others were unharmed.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who cares about how many powers they represent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He steeled himself about rethinking things in such a manner, but he still felt nervous. These kids really did have too many powers behind hem, and it left him feeling slightly numb.</span></p>
