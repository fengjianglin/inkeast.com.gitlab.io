 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

You are the first person to defeat me! Watch out, I will make you regret this in the future!” Yun screamed shrilly, and with that, the phantom image of the giant mountain crumbled away. Lu Yin’s palm, which was pressed against Yun’s abdomen, caused her entire body to shatter into a million pieces. Fragments of metal scattered everywhere, but there was no blood. All that remained were shattered bits of machinery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was stunned; it was finally over.&nbsp;</span></p>

The main reason for this was the sheer level of destruction and oppression that the battle had reached. The violent shockwaves from their battle were so extreme that even the Astral Academy mentors had been forced to step in to stabilize the barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to Starsibyl or Tian Hou’s battles, although they were terrifying in their own right, they were not as tangibly oppressive. This most recent battle had shown countless people the true disparity between them and these peak Limiteers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This battle also solidified Lu Yin’s position. His actual power level was still above Yun’s, and he had proven his right to be called a true Ten Arbiters’ candidate,</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the east side, Starsibyl’s eyes lit up, as reality was getting closer to matching the results of her divination.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a distant location, Nightqueen Yanqing gripped her fist tightly. This bastard was still growing stronger. Even though she had grown stronger as well, the disparity between them was still enormous. In the Daynight clan, there was already no Limiteer who could match up to her, and in fact, even many Explorers would find it hard to defeat her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in Astral-10 was elated by the result.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Outerverse, many powers watched their screens in stunned silence as well.</span></p>

I shall not punish you for what happened back then.”</span></p>

However, the Tournament of the Strongest was different as it represented something else entirely.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though this tournament seemed to be just a competition among the younger generation of the universe, it was actually a ploy for the three domains to negotiate. However, many people saw the competitors as candidates who would one day take over for the Ten Arbiters. The true Ten Arbiters’ candidates represented something different entirely, especially for anomalies with no background such as Lu Yin. He would belong to anyone who managed to successfully recruit him into their clan. Lu Yin was now a true Ten Arbiters’ candidate who existed outside the controlling influence of the various powers. He held a huge attraction to many powers.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the Lifeseek Realm of the Astral Combat Academy’s trial zones, Lu Yin walked out of the battlefield.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin felt like this girl was becoming more and more like Lulu. Was everyone from the Mavis clan this plucky? But if that was true, then who was overseeing the economy?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next battle was between Starsibyl and Tian Hou. At that moment, Tian Hou had already appeared within the battlefield.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Starsibyl was in no hurry to enter. Instead, she walked over to Lu Yin and whispered something into his ear before entering the arena.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin turned around and stared at Starsibyl’s back in shock. Starsibyl had shockingly offered to let him use the Mirror of Clarity within the Lifeseek Realm. The Mirror of Clarity was just like the Heavenly Drum, Tilting Tower, Sky Platform, and the other top training grounds within their respective realms. It was the best training ground in the Lifeseek Realm, and whoever controlled the Mirror of Clarity was the Realm Master of the Lifeseek Realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since Starsibyl had taken control of the Mirror of Clarity, she had only ever allowed Nightqueen Yanqing to use it. And now, at such a crucial moment in the Tournament of the Strongest, she had shockingly agreed to let Lu Yin use it. What did this mean? Lu Yin could not understand why she would voluntarily make such an offer to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the battlefield, Starsibyl smirked. Since the results of her divination were becoming more and more clear, there was no harm if she pushed matters in the direction that the divination indicated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battlefield had already been restored, and this was the umpteenth time that this had happened. Whether it was the battles during the Astral Combat Tournament or the Tournament of the Strongest, this battlefield would always end up being destroyed over and over again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Limiteers had powerful destructive abilities to the extent where, given enough time, they could even bring about the destruction of planets, much less a small piece of land.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Starsibyl of the human race, your reputation precedes you. Even those at the Spiritual Academy have heard of you,” Tian Hou said from where he stood on the battlefield. He was usually a reticent individual.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Starsibyl laughed, unamused. “You have quite a storied reputation yourself since a long time ago, Cosmic Hou.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I hope that this battle will not disappoint me,” Tian Hou indifferently responded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Starsibyl gave him a brief glance. “I guess that I will have to let you down then. My attacking capabilities cannot surpass the upper limits of what you are able to withstand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But the Starsibyl clan has never relied on their attacking capabilities.” After he finished speaking, Tian Hou’s body merged into the void. When he reappeared, he was already at Starsibyl’s side. He stretched out a hand, attempting to banish her into the void, but his attempt was thwarted. His arm exited from a black vortex only to pass through Starsibyl’s image. She had already moved. It could even be said that she had never been there to begin with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Astral Banishment!” A voice cried out from above Tian Hou’s head. He lifted his head slightly, but he did not try to evade the attack. He allowed Starsibyl to reach out and tap him, and at the same time, Tian Hou stretched out a hand to grab Starsibyl. Both of them touched the other at the same time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone watched on intently. Although this battle was not as intense as the previous one between Lu Yin and Yun, it was still just as dangerous. A slight mistake from either one would result in their instant defeat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire audience fell silent as both competitors had successfully landed attacks on the other. Then, Tian Hou’s black robe was visibly torn apart, revealing that strange black vortex that everyone recognized as his body now. On the other side, Starsibyl was engulfed by the void that had opened up behind her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless spectators felt their heart skip a beat; had Starsibyl been defeated?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin narrowed his eyes. He refused to believe that Starsibyl would be defeated this easily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a swoosh, Tian Hou suddenly released his hand and whirled around. Starsibyl, who had been engulfed by the void, slowly vanished, leaving nothing but a white coat behind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people heaved sighs of relief; Starsibyl was fine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your attacks are useless against me,” Tian Hou said. He was unimpressed and spoke as though he was stating the obvious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In front of him, Starsibyl helplessly replied, “Yes, but you are unable to defeat me as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That remains to be seen.” Tian Hou arrogantly raised his head into the air as a new layer of the black vortex spread out beneath him. “This battleground is limiting you. If this was a battle to the death, then perhaps there would be no winner. However, in this restricted area, your defense is useless even if you can divine my attacks. My attacks will engulf the entire area, and given your defenses, you won’t be able to withstand them.” After he finished speaking, the vortex started expanding at an even more rapid pace. It was as if a black hole had appeared above the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the audience watched the vortex expand, some of the students’ pupils spasmed, and then afterwards, they collapsed to the ground. They merely lost consciousness and were not dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone! Do not look at the vortex!” The booming voice of a mentor came from high above. He could no longer stay silent at this moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was horrified; this was too terrifying a scene. The students of Astral-7 suddenly thought back to the student who had strangely collapsed when the competitors from the Astral Beast Domain had first arrived. They looked at Tian Hou with terrified looks on their faces; this creature’s attacks were capable of reaping lives in such a swift fashion that it was scary to even think about.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Starsibyl took to the sky, but as she looked at the vortex that was slowly swallowing the entire arena, a helpless look flashed through her eyes. “Stop the battle. I admit defeat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as she said this, Tian Hou lifted his head, and the vortex beneath his feet started to disappear. “You made a wise choice.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many students had concerned looks on their faces; Starsibyl had been defeated! Even though Starsibyl was not known as an unbeatable individual, she still wielded the power of divination and could predict the future. Now that she had been defeated by a member of the Astral Beast Domain, it was a bitter pill for many to swallow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What Tian Hou had said was correct; this battleground limited Starsibyl’s abilities. Unless Tian Hou could swallow the entire universe, he definitely would not be able to defeat Starsibyl in the wild. This had been an unfair battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

I hope that we can do battle in space next time,” Tian Hou grumbled loudly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Starsibyl gave a faint smile before leaving the Lifeseek Realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The third match of the third round. Victor: Tian Hou.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time that the voice declared Tian Hou’s victory, he turned around to look at Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone who was outside the battleground also looked at Lu Yin. The final battle in the Tournament of the Strongest would be between these two individuals. Who would be victorious? Who was stronger?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One wielded unbelievable destructive capabilities while the other had unfathomable defensive abilities. One was an unstoppable spear while the other was an impenetrable shield. They couldn’t wait for the tournament finals to start!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The screens were completely filled with images of Lu Yin and Tian Hou, and the figures of the two appeared all over the universe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Tournament of the Strongest was being held to bring the Human and the Astral Beast Domains closer together. As fate would have it, a representative from each side had managed to make it to the finals.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Zephyr Flowzone, Shui Chuanxiao’s eyes lit up as he watched Lu Yin on his screen. His time had passed, but this young man’s journey had only just begun.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Innerverse, atop a cliff, there was a long, white sword. A woman with long black hair stared at the screen as an indescribable flash of brilliance passed through her eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, many people’s attention was now focused on Lu Yin. He was not just representing himself—he also represented the entire Human Domain now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, you must be under a lot of pressure,” the monkey suddenly said.&nbsp;</span></p>
