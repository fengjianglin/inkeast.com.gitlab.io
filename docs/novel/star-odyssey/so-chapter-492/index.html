 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lily Anne was surprised. “Secretly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded. “I need to save a friend, and I’m not interested in fighting for pyrolyte. If Northline Flowzone is willing to help me, then I will also do my best to protect your people. Of course, if you are not willing, then you can just pretend that this conversation never happened.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lily Anne quickly answered, “Of course we’ll help. Since Brother Lu has asked, then Northline Flowzone is definitely willing to help. Please just wait for a moment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded and ended the call.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn’t surprised to hear that Lily Anne was willing to help. After all, he had promised that he would try to protect Northline Flowzone’s people. Just that would be a huge help to Northline Flowzone, and it would be a simple task for them to bring him along to Planet Pyrolyte, so they would definitely agree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A map was soon sent to Lu Yin. His eyes lit up, and he immediately rerouted his spacecraft to follow the new route towards Planet Pyrolyte. As soon as he neared Planet Pyrolyte, someone from Northline Flowzone would be waiting for him and help him land on Planet Pyrolyte along with some of Northline Flowzone’s Limiteers. This would allow him to avoid attracting any unwanted attention to himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hunters and Enlighters could use their star energy to observe everyone near them. However, since there was an Enlighter, Granny Chan, within the group from Northline Flowzone, the other Enlighters would not monitor Northline Flowzone’s vessels out of respect towards her. This was also the reason why Lu Yin had chosen Northline Flowzone to help him, as any organization that didn’t have an Enlighter wouldn’t be able to guarantee his anonymity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi was very excited now that she was finally able to go out and have some fun. Many powerhouses from the younger generation had gathered at Planet Pyrolyte, so this would definitely be a fun trip, and she was very happy about it. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin glanced at Hai Qiqi and frowned. “You’re not planning on fighting while on Planet Pyrolyte, right?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi rolled her eyes at Lu Yin. “You’re such a brute! Of course I won’t fight with anyone. I, Sister Qi, like to overcome people with virtue.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why do you call yourself ‘Sister Qi?’” Lu Yin had wanted to ask her this question for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin calculated that it would take them one more day to pass through Northcastle Weave and arrive at Planet Pyrolyte in the Astral Wilderness. He planned to use this time to rest and make sure that his condition was at its peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi answered without hesitation, “My name is Hai Qiqi, so of course I’d be called Sister Qi. Do you have some problem with that?”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A lot of people call me Seventh Bro as well,” Lu Yin calmly informed her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Hai Qiqi didn’t like his response. “No, you can’t be on the same level as me. From now on, you will be Eighth Bro.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was rendered speechless, but then he remembered how the Sea King had changed his name during their first meeting. These two were truly father and daughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eighth Brother! Hahahahah, Eighth Brother! That’s so funny!” The monkey laughed uncontrollably.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin narrowed his eyes and started retracting the star energy from his right arm. The monkey immediately started apologizing and swearing that he would stop talking about the new name as long as Lu Yin didn’t screen him off again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How did you convince Hai Dashao to support the Great Yu Empire?’ Lu Yin asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi smiled wickedly. “I know a lot of his secrets, so I can get him to do anything I want by threatening him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded, completely believing her. Hai Qiqi seemed to be skilled in this area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Astral Wilderness was a strange part of the universe that remained extremely mysterious to most people. However, to Lu Yin, it wasn’t any more special than the Innerverse or the Outerverse. The space there was still just as dark as anywhere else, and the only difference seemed to be that he couldn’t use his gadget in this place. When he entered the Astral Wilderness, it felt as if technology had regressed by tens of thousands of years.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An astral beast soon flew past their spacecraft with gigantic, flaming wings. The sight of the beast stirred Hai Qiqi into an excited frenzy as she held a special interest in flying astral beasts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s expression grew serious; anything could appear in this unexplored region of the universe. He still hadn’t forgotten about the enormous centipede corpse that had appeared in Northline Flowzone. That thing could have crushed him to pieces with just a random twitch.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, since Northline Flowzone had provided him with this route, it should be relatively safe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s guess was right, as this was actually the route that had been taken by Granny Chan when she had first traveled to Planet Pyrolyte. She had eliminated anything dangerous along this route, so there was nothing along the way that had a power level of even 10,000.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such routes were extremely valuable to major powers, and they had paid a price by giving it to Lu Yin. Now, they needed to wait and see if Lu Yin was worth the price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin gazed into the distance and knew that they were approaching Planet Pyrolyte.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Planet Pyrolyte was like a piece of delicious cake that had attracted the attention of all the major organizations. When Lu Yin saw Planet Pyrolyte, he also saw numerous spacecraft of various shapes and sizes surrounding it. The most easily recognizable one was the Sword Sect’s extremely impressive sword-shaped battleship. Apart from that, the spacecraft from the Daynight clan and the Souldream Tribe were also unique and stood out from the rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin wasn’t intercepted by anyone and managed to enter Northline Flowzone’s spacecraft without issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Granny Chan present, no Enlighter would dare to monitor this part of space, and thus, no one knew that Lu Yin had arrived.&nbsp;</span></p>

This truly impressed upon Lu Yin the importance of pyrolite. He humbly greeted Granny Chan. “Lu Yin pays his respects to Granny Chan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Granny Chan looked at Lu Yin with satisfaction. “You don’t have to be so polite, as this isn’t our first time meeting.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin glanced at Lily Anne, who was standing behind Granny Chan, and nodded. “I did meet you once when I represented the Ten Arbiters’s Council as a witness for the competition at the Northline Platform. You look as graceful as ever.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Granny Chan smiled. “You have a smooth tongue. Was the journey here peaceful?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin answered, “It was very peaceful, thank you for asking.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Granny Chan looked towards Hai Qiqi, who was standing behind Lu Yin, but she didn’t ask about her. Northline Flowzone was a minor force and didn’t have access to as much information as the Daynight clan or the Sword Sect. Thus, they didn’t know much about the Sea King’s Dome. Moreover, Hai Qiqi was wearing clothing from the Zenyu Star, so it was normal that Granny Chan couldn’t recognize the young woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back when they were on Zenyu Star, <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Karthika</span> had only recognized Hai Qiqi because of the emblem on the spacecraft. However, he had not exposed her presence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lily Anne had met Hai Qiqi before, and she also knew that this girl was the Sea King’s daughter, but she wasn’t planning on informing Granny Chan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi didn’t care much about Granny Chan. The woman was merely an Enlighter, and there were lots of those under her father. Thus, this person was nothing special in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Granny Chan soon left, leaving Lily Anne to entertain Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin heaved a sigh of relief once the older woman left. He didn’t like the feeling of being so close to someone who could kill him at any time, even though the woman held no bad feelings towards him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Lu, it must have been a tiring journey for you. Let me take you somewhere to get some rest,” Lily Anne offered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin shook his head. “It wasn’t tiring at all. I was just on a spacecraft.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah, it wasn’t tiring at all. Hurry up and send us to Planet Pyrolyte!” Hai Qiqi spoke anxiously as she was truly looking forward to going down to Planet Pyrolyte.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lily Anne glanced at Hai Qiqi. She wasn’t planning on exposing the girl’s status as the Sea King’s daughter. After all, as soon as the girl’s status was publicized, Northline Flowzone would be responsible for her safety, which was a tremendous burden, especially because of this girl’s quirks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lily Anne also didn’t plan on forming any sort of bond with Hai Qiqi. She had already learned that it would be useless to suck up to Hai Qiqi when she first met her. Instead, the best option was just to treat the girl normally.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Lu, all of the resources have already been prepared for you. Are you going to head down to Planet Pyrolyte now?” Lily Anne asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded before Lily Anne ordered some people to store some food and water in a cosmic ring which she then passed to Lu Yin. She then escorted Lu Yin to a hangar with many personal spacecraft where there were already some people waiting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin changed his appearance and also made Hai Qiqi change her appearance. They then each boarded a personal spacecraft and programmed their landing site. Lu Yin looked up as the spacecraft vibrated. In the end, he had still come to Planet Pyrolyte, the stage that had been set up for geniuses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi was excited; she had been waiting for this moment for a long time. She wanted her name to become renowned throughout the universe and surpass her brother. She didn’t care that Lu Yin had told her not to reveal her identity, as her main goal was to become famous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One by one, the personal spacecraft flew out from Northline Flowzone’s spacecraft and headed down towards Planet Pyrolyte. At the same time, there were other spacecraft from the other major powers that were preparing to enter the planet as well. There was a countless number of Limiteers descending onto Planet Pyrolyte at all times. It was as if the place had become a massive furnace that tempered all the Limiteers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some distance away, Nightqueen Qiuyu felt disdainful towards the Limiteers who were being sent down. Since there were elite powerhouses already present down below, any number of average Limiteers would be useless against them. She didn’t care about the number of cultivators that Northline Flowzone sent down, as those cultivators were just being sent to their deaths. She paused a moment and then looked away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sword Sect and the Wen family similarly didn’t care about the people who were being sent down by the minor powers. However, none of them could have imagined that there was a genius currently hidden in this batch.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On Planet Pyrolyte, there was a mountain range protruding from the ground that lay quite some distance from Pyrolyte Mountain. These peaks were only about a hundred meters high, and the range didn’t cover a large region either. Despite this, there were still hundreds of Limiteers fighting over this location. This was because this mountain range contained a small amount of pyrolyte ore, but it was nonetheless still enough to attract Limiteers from the minor flowzones.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The major forces weren’t interested in such a place, so the minor forces were left to fight over it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Gang, Ah Fan, and the other Limiteers from Northline Flowzone were currently fighting for control of this mountain range.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Northgate Gang and Ah Fan had been injured, but they couldn't even retreat since they were surrounded by enemies. A girl from Northline Flowzone screamed as she collapsed to the ground. A blade flashed, and she looked at the descending blade in despair. But right before the blade reached her, a weapon that looked like a knife appeared to block it, the vibrations from the impact shoving the girl into the ground. She vomited blood and then looked at the person who had saved her; it was Ah Fan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ah Fan panted heavily as he attacked the man in front of him. The man sneered and someone else jumped out from behind him, slashing at Ah Fan. At the same time, two-lined battle force erupted around the attacker, causing the girl to scream, “Be careful!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ah Fan gritted his teeth, but he managed to block the surprise attack. However, his abdomen was slashed open by the first person, which caused him to double over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Gang, who was nearby, cursed at Ah Fan for bothering to help someone else. He had initially planned on fighting his way out of the encirclement with Ah Fan, but his plan had been thwarted now that Ah Fan had become heavily injured.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Battles were taking place everywhere, and Northgate Gang tried to escape by himself using his Phantom Disc, but he was pushed back into the fray once again. Another group of Limiteers had joined the fight, and shockwaves were exploding from every direction.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang bang bang!</span></p>
