If that was the case, then why had he been so secretive earlier?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One person towered above all others like a peak, casting a shadow over everyone. At this moment, even Mu Rong’s image seemed to fade a bit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In space, numerous spacecraft suddenly formed words, “Unite, kill Lu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These simple words showed an incomparable determination. It had been the Daynight clan’s spacecraft to form those words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next moment, Zhanlong Daynight acted first. He raised his right hand and gathered all of his strength, and with a boundless power that warped the void, he released a punch. “Lu Yin, it’s been a long while.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s gaze shook when he saw Zhanlong Daynight’s punch. Everyone focused on him as he slowly raised his right hand. There was a tremendous explosion as smoke rose into the air around Lu Yin. A visible shockwave rippled out, pushing Hai Qiqi and the others back. The mountain range itself cracked open as a fissure snaked through the void, causing many onlookers to turn pale.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the dust settled, there was a woosh, and Lu Yin’s calm face appeared in everyone’s vision. He had not taken even half a step back, and his hand was tightly clenched around Zhanlong Daynight’s right fist, keeping the Daynight youth from advancing or retreating.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless mouths fell open as they stared at the scene in disbelief. This person was Zhanlong Daynight, one of the top powerhouses of the Daynight clan, and he was someone comparable to Liu Shaoqiu. In fact, he was also qualified to act as one of the powerhouses who had worked to surround Mu Rong, but his punch had been casually stopped by Lu Yin. It had to be acknowledged that, even if Ling Que or someone else at that level was attacked by Zhanlong Daynight’s punch, they would have had to retaliate or dodge. No one else could effortlessly receive such an attack besides Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight stared straight at Lu Yin as his eyes flickered in disbelief. “You- your strength.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes narrowed. “The current you is too weak.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin then exerted a bit of strength through his hand and broke Zhanlong Daynight’s hand with a sharp crack. The Daynight youth was then flung aside just like Nightqueen Yanqing. He spat out a mouthful of blood and lost consciousness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked down at him. “I’ll look for you again after I deal with the rest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He then stepped forward and disappeared, only to next be seen at the base of the mountain range.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had used merely two attacks to eliminate two of the strongest Daynight experts on Planet Pyrolyte. Just two attacks had dispatched two top-notch Daynight experts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s strength caused everyone else present to feel as if an insurmountable shadow had crept over their hearts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yōu Ye'er was astonished, as this person was indeed powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi blinked.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, he’s not bad to watch. I can understand why father is considering making him his son-in-law. I get why he didn’t directly order Lu Yin to come here and get the pyrolyte—hold on, that’s not right. What future son-in-law? That won’t happen!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Above the planet, Nightqueen Qiuyu’s eyes changed after Zhanlong Daynight and Nightqueen Yanqing were both thoroughly defeated after just two moves from Lu Yin. How could such a thing happen? Could there really be such a huge disparity between Limiteers? Lu Yin’s strength caused the old lady to think of the Ten Arbiters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On Planet Pyrolyte, at the base of the mountain range, Lord Pisces stared at Lu Yin, who had just suddenly appeared, in astonishment. In the blink of an eye, this person had appeared in front of Lord Pisces, who was not even five meters away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s gaze swept over everyone. “I’ll only say this just once: this mountain range belongs to me now. Everyone else, get lost.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que looked up, walked a few steps forward, and arrogantly stared at Lu Yin. “You’ve got balls. Even if you’re the strongest Limiteer, do you really think that you can stop all of us?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin turned towards Ling Que. “You can try.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que’s eyes went wide. “Everyone, attack him together! If we can’t defeat him, then no one will get anything from this place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as he finished speaking, he moved to attack, his Que’s Mighty Slash slicing through the void as it moved towards Lu Yin. Ling Que had put his full strength into this attack as he clearly remembered that this bastard had trapped his blade with just two fingers. This was not some random innate gift, as there was no one else who could stop Ling Que’s blade with just a couple of fingers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Next to Ling Que, Mu Rong also moved to attack. Since they were facing Lu Yin, he had chosen to cooperate with Ling Que. Before this, Ling Que and the rest had been attacking Mu Rong, but now, everyone had united against Lu Yin, even Mu Rong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The void before Lu Yin’s eyes was torn apart as the Que's Mighty Slash emerged. However, Lu Yin merely raised a hand and lightly tapped against the blade, sending it spiraling in another direction with a thump. He then raised his hand towards Ling Que and released a palm attack. By this time, he had already unleashed the grains of Fatesand around his heart and left arm, hiding them within his clothes. In other words, he had removed two-thirds of the seal that suppressed his physical strength. Right now, Lu Yin was invincible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The shockwave that the Spacerender Palm unleashed blasted through the void and snarled as it shot towards Ling Que like a strange beast. Ling Que’s eyes shrank, as he had already known that Lu Yin was powerful, but had Lu Yin’s strength really reached such a ridiculous extent that he could flick away his blade with one finger? This toppled Ling Que’s worldview. How was the disparity between them so vast?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a boom, the Spacerender Palm swept through one direction, though Ling Que was able to avoid it. However, everyone else in that area was struck, and they all lost their ability to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beneath Lu Yin, green grass appeared as the farmer boy's song was heard. Lu Yin’s brows rose. “You didn’t learn your lesson. Your farmer boy's song is useless against me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His body then trembled, and the void fractured as Lu Yin raised a hand towards Mu Rong, whose face changed as he quickly evaded the attack. A massive shockwave struck the place he had just been standing at.&nbsp;</span></p>

In just a few seconds, Lu Yin had demonstrated a strength that caused everyone to feel fear from the bottom of their hearts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Freak, he’s a freak!” someone shouted as they stared at Lu Yin in terror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At those words, the crowd immediately backed away from Lu Yin. “He’s a freak! He’s invincible!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Freak...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Against Mu Rong, the crowd had still been able to unite with Ling Que and have a relatively even battle, but against Lu Yin, even when Mu Rong joined their forces, they still felt like they were tiny ants trying to shake a giant tree. This was not a battle that could be won through simple numerical superiority.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qian'er looked on, dumbfounded. This was the strength of a peerless Limiteer. She had vastly overestimated herself at one point by wanting to experience such a strength for herself. Not to mention her, even Ling Que was too weak compared to Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since Mister Mu had upgraded Lu Yin’s physical body to the absolute limit, he had reached the same level of the Limiteer realm as that war spirit with closed eyes. This meant that Lu Yin was truly invincible, and he could perhaps match the strength shown by the Ten Arbiters when they had been Limiteers. At this moment, there was no one in the crowd who could stand up to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong looked at Lu Yin with a grave expression, as the current Lu Yin made even him feel powerless. He had already exchanged blows with Lu Yin once, and he had acutely sensed this person’s strength then. At the start, there had not been much of a disparity between them, and Lu Yin had not possessed the strength to shake off his farmer boy's song. However, by the end of their battle, Lu Yin had released a strength that belonged to an entirely different level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was what Mu Rong had come to realize at the Sea King’s Dome. However, at this moment on Planet Pyrolyte, Lu Yin had revealed his most powerful strength right from the very beginning of the battle. Mu Rong was not able to resist such a power, and the other people at his level were no different.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, the only ones who could fight against Lu Yin were either Explorers or perhaps even Cruisers, as he was truly an unequalled Limiteer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In outer space, above the planet, the various major powers were also all flabbergasted. The disparity displayed through this battle was too great, and it was not something that could be compensated for with numbers</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Sword Sect’s spacecraft, Elder <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span> was shocked. “There’s no explanation for this kid! Think of a way to send Explorers down to Planet Pyrolyte. Order Liu Shaoqiu and the rest to retreat back to Pyrolyte Mountain. They can’t fight against this kid.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, Elder.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside the Wen family’s spacecraft, Mira’s expression was similarly overwhelmed. She had not thought that, after not seeing Lu Yin for a while, that he would be able to become this strong, and certainly not to this exaggerated of a level. The current Lu Yin could even attract the attention of the Ten Arbiters. When they had been Limiteers in the past, they had been similarly invincible, but they had probably not surpassed Lu Yin’s current strength. It was possible that he already possessed a strength that could rival her own.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one would have thought that some nobody cultivator from Earth would be able to reach such a level and would hold such a supreme position within the Limiteer realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, the Daynight clan and Wen family also sent out orders for their ground forces to retreat. The elders could see the difference more clearly than the Limiteers on the ground. Lu Yin was not someone who their juniors could deal with.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the words in the skies changed, they all formed the same word: “Retreat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the base of the mountain range, everyone inexplicably relaxed, as they no longer had to fight against this freak anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked up, as the various powers that had been able to survive in the Innerverse had a rather decisive way of doing things. For them to order a retreat so quickly proved that they already had other plans. They might work to threaten Lu Yin himself, or find other powerhouses to send down here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu walked out from the forces of the Sword Sect with a resolute gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Xiaoyun’s face changed. “What are you doing? The elder ordered us to retreat!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others also looked at Liu Shaoqiu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu determinedly walked towards Lu Yin. “You and I had an agreement to challenge the Top 100 Rankings at the same time.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s right,” Lu Yin answered faintly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu’s gaze trembled. “I have a feeling that this battle might be the last one we have as Limiteers, as well as the first. I don’t want to miss this opportunity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes narrowed. “You aren’t my match.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu gripped his hilt tightly. “So what? This is my path of the sword.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In outer space, Elder <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span> and the rest all fell silent. Liu Shaoqiu had been able to inherit the Thirteen Swords, which was related to his path of the sword. In this current battle, regardless of the outcome, he had to act, or else his path would collapse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They would rather Liu Shaoqiu fight Lu Yin than destroy his path of the sword, even if it meant him being killed in this fight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, the Sword Sect did not believe that Lu Yin would actually dare to kill Liu Shaoqiu, as that would create a death debt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s head hurt, as someone with such an extreme sense of conviction was the most troublesome to deal with. Zhang Dingtian was one such person, and it seemed that this Liu Shaoqiu in front of him was another one. Ever since Lu Yin had started cultivating, he had relied on his die and his destiny. He held no strong determination towards cultivation itself. At this moment, when he looked at Liu Shaoqiu’s face, Lu Yin felt like he was lacking something himself and that he should also hold some sort of conviction.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then go ahead,” Lu Yin replied.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone stared at Liu Shaoqiu, as the Fourth Sword had not been enough to defeat even Ling Que and Mu Rong. Did that mean that he was about to use the Fifth Sword?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Each of the Thirteen Swords was overwhelming, and everyone wanted to take a look at the Fifth Sword’s power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu inhaled deeply as he clenched his sword’s hilt. His eyes flashed with his resolve. He was indeed about to display the Fifth Sword, which was a technique that he had yet to comprehend. It was already extremely terrifying for him to display the Fourth Sword with the strength of a Limiteer, and the Fifth Sword was something that he should only touch after breaking through to the Explorer realm. However, he had to use it now, or he would have no chance at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps, after using the Fifth Sword, he would become crippled! But even so, he would not regret it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Below the mountains, many cultivators pulled away from the two since they were afraid of being caught up in the impending battle’s aftershocks. Lu Yin did not attack, showing his respect for Liu Shaoqiu’s determination; he would give Liu Shaoqiu ample time to prepare.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cultivators continued to back away when one of them suddenly looked at his own sword in surprise. His sword was quivering, and the various swordsmen around him all found that their blades were similarly quivering, as if they could not be controlled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a forcefield. One that had yet to fully emerge, but one that still existed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Fourth Sword manifested in the form of a domain filled with sword qi, and it was able to unleash a powerful attack. At this moment, a forcefield had merged into the surrounding area.</span></p>
