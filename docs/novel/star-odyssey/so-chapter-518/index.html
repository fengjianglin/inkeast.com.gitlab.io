Did you think that all that is just for show? This senior may not know about other things, but I do know this: the inheritor of the Thirteen Swords may be defeated, but they can never retreat. This is because in the end, the Thirteen Swords will forever be the most powerful. This is a path to ultimate power, and any defeat is just because you cannot cultivate it well enough,” Long Yun explained with a tinge of envy and longing in his voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu’s eyes flickered, and he stood in place as he silently pondered over his senior’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun did not say anything more and walked away. Actually, he had simply come up with some rubbish since he was afraid of trouble. He had actually just said that so that Liu Shaoqiu would not pester him any further. However, his words could not be considered as pure rubbish, because the invincibility of the Thirteen Swords was real. However, that was only so when looking at all of history. There were times when the inheritors of the Thirteen Swords met crazy geniuses, and met with a tragic end where their entire generation was suppressed. For example, the current generation was in such a situation. Of course, Long Yun definitely would not mention those details.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the sky, Lu Yin continued to absorb star energy from star essences while also using the Shamrock Enterprises’ special medicines to treat the wounds on his chest and hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He placed special attention on the area in his chest where he had a deep horizontal gash that had caused half of his clothes to be stained red.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, cut down on how often you do this stuff in the future. You’re not alone! If you die, then I’ll die too.” The Ghost Monkey was unhappy with Lu Yin’s actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin simply replied, “As long as I continue to cultivate, such actions are unavoidable.” He then sighed, saying, “I haven’t suffered from injuries this severe in a long time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So, how many more times do you want to go through with this?” the monkey shrieked in exasperation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin laughed. If experiencing such an event could allow his battle force to improve, then why wouldn’t he take the risk?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was indeed very powerful now with six-lined battle force, but when would he manage to break through to the Explorer realm? He still did not have the feeling that he was close to a breakthrough, and the five-stage formcast model was still inside of him. Before he broke through, he would have to upgrade the formcast model once more to a six-stage formcast model. That would be perfect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He recalled that it had taken him 300,000 star crystals to upgrade the formcast model from a four-stage model to a five-stage model. He wondered how many more star crystals it would take to upgrade it one step further to a six-stage formcast model? It should be a lot since there were very few six-stage formcast models even in the entire universe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Hunter could create a normal formcast model, but a five-stage formcast model required at least an Enlighter to create it. A six-stage formcast model was on a different level, and it might require a monster like Northgate Taisui to get involved.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin wondered if there was such a thing as a seven-stage formcast model. If so, would that require an Envoy with a power level of over 500,000?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wondered if the Sea King was able to form a seven-stage formcast model. He would have to find an opportunity to question Hai Qiqi later. She definitely had a formcast model inside of her body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the mountain range entered his sight, Lu Yin moved towards it. However, his expression fell since he suddenly sensed an extreme danger. He had no time to retrieve the Giant Emperor’s third eye, but he subconsciously activated the Cosmic Art, and his eyes filled with star energy, which allowed him to move to the side with the Secret Sidestep technique. Dozens of strange weapons with green stripes suddenly pierced through the void and landed where he had just been as a figure appeared in front of him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin broke into a cold sweat, as he had been too careless. He had nearly fallen for that ambush just now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This figure was wrapped in a black robe, and he stared at Lu Yin in astonishment. He had clearly not expected his ambush to fail. However, the attacker did not stop and raised a hand before lunging at Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was enraged, as this person had nearly succeeded in ambushing him. If he had been impaled by those sharp weapons, then he would have definitely died. This person had to die, but Lu Yin could not act impulsively. He had seen how many rune lines made up this person, and it was about the same amount as Long Yun’s. This was another top-tier expert.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Above the planet, the various organizations did not notice the appearance of this person, and they had not seen when he had arrived or which force he belonged to since he was completely covered by the black robes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The figure grabbed at Lu Yin, who retreated while six-lined battle force burst forth from his body. He tapped out lightly, but his extreme physical strength created a gale of wind that was strong enough to repel people like Ling Que or Mu Rong. However, a strange weapon appeared in the black-robed figure’s hands, which he used to withstand Lu Yin’s attack after similarly coating it with six-lined battle force. Then, the hooded figure’s other hand lifted up, causing a chill to run down Lu Yin’s spine. He dodged again with the Secret Sidestep technique, and numerous weapons pierced through the void to stab at where he had just been standing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What is this?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was flabbergasted. Just how had these weapons appeared out of nowhere?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, look!” the monkey cried out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked at the figure again and saw that the black robes shrouding the figure had ripped open. While the face was unfamiliar, he had that unmistakable, eye-catching black-and-white hair. It was someone from the Daynight clan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one would have expected the Daynight clan to secretly send a top-notch expert down to Planet Pyrolyte, but this person had nearly killed Lu Yin in an ambush. The Daynight clan was just too ruthless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes turned sharp, and he used Flash Step to dash towards the Daynight man and then slam down with a palm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heavenly Armory.” The Daynight man looked up as strange weapons suddenly appeared all around his body, hiding him from view. The moment they appeared, the weapons were also wrapped in the green lines of six-lined battle force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was taken aback, as these weapons had been formed from an innate gift.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone in outer space, above the planet, cried out, “I got it! That’s Zhanbing Daynight, ranked fifty fifth on the Top 100 Rankings! He’s a Daynight genius.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The various great powers quickly recognized the attacker one after another as his innate gift was too conspicuous. It was to turn anything he touched into a sturdy weapon. Also, his battle technique was not one that belonged to the Daynight clan. Rather, it was something that he had obtained from the Dao of Slaughter in the Astral Combat Academy’s trial zones. This was an inherited ancient battle technique: Heavenly Armory.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Daynight expert who did not use the Daynight clan’s battle techniques was indeed very eye-catching.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On Planet Pyrolyte, Lu Yin stared at the powerhouse in front of him with shock. Zhanbing Daynight had covered his body with countless weapons, and he currently looked like some monster that was armed to the teeth. And on top of that, every last one of the weapons was covered with six-lined battle force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the rune lines representing Zhanbing Daynight were in no way inferior to Long Yun’s when he had used seven-lined battle force. Although this person only had six-lined battle force like Lu Yin, his battle technique and innate gift were able to make up for the difference, making him a top-notch expert who was not much weaker than Long Yun.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a whoosh as Zhanbing Daynight pressed one hand down in Lu Yin’s direction. From the sky, a powerful arm formed from weapons ruthlessly slammed down onto Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin gritted his teeth and punched out. There was a bang, and the void distorted for a moment before collapsing. Lu Yin was forced underground by Zhanbing Daynight, and half of his body went numb.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the strength of the individual ranked fifty-fifth on the Top 100 Rankings. This was someone whom <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Kayze</span> could not compare to, not to mention Ze Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanbing Daynight did not give Lu Yin any chance to catch his breath. He ferociously slammed his hand into the ground again, wanting to smash Lu Yin to death then and there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes went wide. He had not thought that he would have to use it here, but he released his Fatesand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a loud explosion, and Zhanbing Daynight’s two arms composed of weapons twisted as they smashed into the ground, causing the entirety of Planet Pyrolyte to tremble. A giant fissure emerged in the ground that extended out for hundreds of kilometers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What followed was an intense rumbling, as Zhanbing Daynight did not stop attacking. He struck out dozens of times and caused the surrounding area to completely disappear, leaving only a floor of lava.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in outer space blankly stared at the scene, as that attack had been way too brutal. Zhanbing Daynight had not given Lu Yin any chance to survive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Ren watched the events calmly, though Hai Dashao had clenched both of his fists. Against the expert ranked fifty-fifth on the Top 100 Rankings, Lu Yin’s chances of survival were slim, even if he had comprehended six-lined battle force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not too far from the battleground, even the mountain range had been completely split open, though Northgate Lie and the rest did not even dare to intervene. They could only stare fearfully at the enormous monster that was Zhanbing Daynight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi’s whereabouts were currently unknown, as she was not at the mountain range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun and the others looked in the direction of Pyrolyte Mountain, and they were shocked to feel the pressure of a top-notch expert.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanbing Daynight slowly rose up, looking like a giant monster overseeing its domain. He stared at the roiling lava. He had a cold expression on his face. His mission this time was to kill this person, and he was certain that all of his attacks had landed on him. Lu Yin’s death was unquestionable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He turned back to look at the mountain range, raised his weaponized arm, and then aimed it at Northgate Lie. A dozen weapons fired out at them. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Lie was overwhelmed, and he immediately used his Phantom Disc in an attempt to defend against the weapons. However, he had vastly overestimated his own abilities. He was able to block the majority of the weapons, but the few that he missed caused heavy casualties among Northline Flowzone’s forces. Even Lily Anne was injured, as she fell to the ground in a miserable condition.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a weapon stuck in Northgate Lie’s leg, and his face looked desperate as he stared at Zhanbing Daynight. Was the disparity between them that great? This was a person ranked fifty-fifth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Lu Yin battled against Long Yun at Pyrolyte Mountain, he had left in high spirits after his battle force broke through to six lines, but no one, least of all him, had expected to run into an ambush from Zhanbing Daynight. It was unknown if Lu Yin was still alive, but the mountain range was about to be taken over by the Daynight clan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanbing Daynight’s power was unquestionable, and he was already confident that Lu Yin had died. How could a mere Limiteer survive so many attacks from him? Could he really be that much of a monster?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Above Planet Pyrolyte, one personal spacecraft charged into the atmosphere and landed exactly where Zhanbing Daynight stood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The area around Planet Pyrolyte had already been sealed, so no one could enter without approval from the various forces. This personal spacecraft had taken advantage of everyone being distracted by Zhanbing Daynight to quickly shoot down onto Planet Pyrolyte.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone had initially wanted to block the vessel, but in the end, no one did. If the person on the ship was a Limiteer, then it was useless for them to go down to Planet Pyrolyte. And if they were an Explorer, then they would definitely die without question if they didn’t have a star essence skin. There was no need to block this person.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanbing Daynight towered high in the sky, and Nightqueen Yanqing and the others soon appeared one after another from a distance. They smiled. The mountain range had ended up belonging to them in the end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, the spacecraft that had barged into Planet Pyrolyte entered their sight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanbing Daynight casually released several weapons to attack the vessel, and each one was lined with with six-lined battle force as they tore through the void. He had assumed that the spacecraft would be easily destroyed by his attack, but when the weapons approached the spacecraft, they all broke apart and were reduced to dust.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanbing Daynight’s expression immediately changed, and he raised his giant weaponized arm and ruthlessly fired another volley of weapons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spacecraft continued its flight towards the ground, and a pretty figure appeared in midair. The void suddenly distorted in front of Zhanbing Daynight. He and the crowd behind him could vaguely make out a figure wearing a white coat embroidered with golden threads. There was a silver-white scabbard as well as black hair that hung down to the waist of the figure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a whoosh as sword qi streaked past, splitting Zhanbing Daynight’s arm of weapons in two and eradicating his six-lined battle force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene shocked everyone, including the various great powers in space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was Zhanbing Daynight, someone ranked fifty-fifth on the Top 100 Rankings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanbing Daynight was stunned, and he hurriedly retreated since he had felt a considerable amount of danger in that instant. He had encountered a terrifying powerhouse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A gale swept past him and swirled up the dark-red dust that floated by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the skies, a young and beautiful woman appeared in everyone’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wendy Yushan?” Above the planet, Moore was shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Others also quickly recognized the girl. She was ranked eighteenth on the Top 100 Rankings and was also one of the few Explorers who were in the front twenty: Wendy Yushan.</span></p>
