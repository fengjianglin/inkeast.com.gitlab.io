 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

He had never expected that Han Chong would be able to discover him. This person’s comprehension of his domain was quite high, and even Lu Yin’s Invisible Aura Technique had not been able to completely avoid its detection. Lu Yin felt that he should also try to learn to comprehend a domain, or else he would remain vulnerable to others’ domains in future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Still, after his interruption, it was not very likely that they would continue with their plans to mount an attack on the Tower of Resonating Light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Is that one of the nodes for the five sealing planets?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Lu Yin wondered to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back at the now ruined house, Han Chong and the rest each left separately. Grandini had a solemn expression, and she sought out Han Chong afterwards. “That person dissolved your technique, so he should be a Lockbreaker.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Chong nodded and smiled. “There’s no need to think about it any further. I already have a guess as to who he is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Me too. Since he was able to match my strength, is a Lockbreaker, and also has such great speed, it can only be him,” Grandini said with an excited tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who would have thought that the top four would all gather in Mingdu… This will be interesting,” Han Chong murmured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Grandini was shocked. “Top four? Starsibyl’s here as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Chong nodded. “She should be. Besides us, there are other trialtakers who have come to the capital, and some of them are no weaker than us. There are even those who are more powerful than us. The day of celebration will definitely not be peaceful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were only twenty three days remaining until the celebration. As the days counted down one by one, the Demon Hunters called in large numbers of experts to the capital, though the Ming Constables’ Ming Vanguard’s numbers dwindled. Reportedly, they had been deployed at the last minute to protect important personnel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Various high ranking officials had gathered from all across the Shenwu Empire. Crown Prince Ming Hao naturally could not let anything happen to them, as the consequences would be severe even in the lightest case. Hence, he had used his authority as the crown prince to mobilize the Ming Vanguard to protect them all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Recently, there have been great changes in the List of Tempering. Many experts have emerged, and they could very well be foreigners. The Ming Constables master has ordered us, the Ming Vanguard, to select powerhouses to defeat those who have recently joined the list. Who here is confident in their ability?” stated the Ming Vanguard commander, Bei Zhigui, as he scanned the gathered Ming Constables members.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was a subordinate under Bei Zhigui, who was an Explorer. The commander was not qualified to challenge the members of the List of Tempering even though the list was a method that Crown Prince Ming Hao used to display the empire’s strength. Even if they suspected that these new members were all foreigners, the Ming Vanguard could not capture the people on the list without good reason, or else people would suspect the List of Tempering of being manipulated fair. Hence, they could only kick them off the list before they gained any more influence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Zhigui spoke simple words, but the List of Tempering was a fair and honest ranking. Any expert who was able to step foot onto the List of Tempering had done so by challenging a previous member, so their strength could not be underestimated. Even though those in the Ming Vanguard had decent strength, they were still not confident in challenging those on the list.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Zhigui felt helpless, as there were very few experts in the entire Ming Constables who could challenge the List of Tempering. The list contained the top 200 Martial Monarch experts of the empire, and when these 200 were dispersed throughout the empire, it meant that there were few left on Ming Island, let alone the Ming Constables. Fortunately, there was still Li Zimo in the Ming Constables, who was ranked second on the List of Tempering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Does no one dare to step up to the challenge? The Ming Constables master has given the order that those who enter the top twenty on the List of Tempering will be made into deputy commanders while the top ten will be made commanders,” Bei Zhigui called out again in an attempt to incentivize the soldiers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin felt eager at the offered benefits, but he still did not move, as he felt a trace of unease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Shang stepped out. “This subordinate is willing to volunteer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Zhigui looked at him with a surprised look, but he quickly nodded and said, “Alright, here is the most recent List of Tempering.” He passed one to Wu Shang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Shang scanned it and then walked out of the Ming Constables.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were twelve names on the list that had changed recently, and two had even entered the top twenty of the List of Tempering. One was in Mingdu while the other was one city away from Mingdu, in Huaiqi city. Wu Shang headed for the latter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After leaving the capital, Wu Shang looked at the top of the List of Tempering as his eyes twinkled. His eyes narrowed, and then he quickly moved into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, Bei Zhigui appeared in front of Wu Shang, blocking his path. “I’ll go with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Shang respectfully replied, “There’s no need to trouble the commander.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Zhigui looked at Wu Shang before suddenly making a move. A sword swept out from the commander’s palm while Wu Shang’s eyes turned icy cold and his accumulated martial power suddenly burst forth. In an instant, multiple cracks appeared in the sky as more trialtakers arrived; they were actually coincidentally being dropped off at the capital.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The numerous members of the Ming Vanguard who had accompanied Bei Zhigui were shocked, and they immediately took out their heavenly globes</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin pitied these newcomers, which unlucky bastards had descended here? This coincidence had simply sent them straight to death’s door!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Five individuals dropped out of five cracks; there were three Limiteers and two Explorers. One Explorer even fell on top of Bei Zhigui’s head. The commander immediately retaliated, shouting, “Alien! It’s time to die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Native,” the fallen Explorer disparagingly shot back. There was a loud rumble as the earth shook.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, one of the four mountain peaks surrounding the capital lit up with a dazzling radiance as a terrifying martial power swept across the sky, shocking the entire capital.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Zhaoshu raised his head as he muttered, “Martial Sovereign.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Bank of Wuyun, Ah-Lan, who was the disguised Grandini Mavis, raised her head. “So the rumors are true. Every peak has a Martial Sovereign overseeing it.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when everyone assumed that the battle was about to end, a sword qi sliced through the area, tearing the void apart. The attack left a shocking spatial crack in its wake that seemed to cause the heavens to collapse. Many were stunned by the sight and felt their hair stand on end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crown Prince Ming Hao was the first to stand up, and his expression had changed drastically. “How is this possible?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Zhaoshu was similarly shocked as he crushed his glass in his hands. “A super powerhouse.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So the Sword Sect’s Long Yun was here, hahaha!” A tremendous sound wave engulfed the capital before spreading out into the distance. At the same time, terrifying attacks shot out from the other three peaks towards the east.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Goodbye, hahahaha.” Another sword qi swept out, causing the simultaneous attack from all four Martial Sovereigns to be stopped and even directly eradicated. Long Yun had not shown himself from the start of the confrontation to the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a shocking scene, and many were utterly terrified. One foreign alien had held his own against four Martial Sovereigns; this was an absolute powerhouse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The experts of the Shenwu Continent believed that while the foreigners may be strong, their top powerhouses were nothing much, and that they were even slightly weaker than the strongest powerhouses of their continent. However, Long Yun’s sword had completely shattered those assumptions. It was as if he had torn through a veil and shown those of the Shenwu Continent what reality was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crown Prince Ming Hao was also stunned beyond belief; that foreigner was a Martial Emperor like him, but the foreigner had withstood a combined attack from four Martial Sovereigns.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;He could not understand it. Even if he used all of the Shenwu Empire’s resources for his own cultivation, he would never be able to reach this terrifying level of strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Zhaoshu had a downcast expression, and a thought that he had long sealed away in his heart now resurfaced; he was going to take the Shenwu Continent out with him. From his view, the Shenwu Continent had never truly stopped the foreigners’ invasion, but had instead simply been placed under supervision. The natives were all to be pitied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Outside the capital, Lu Yin’s brows jumped up.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sword Sect, Long Yun?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;So he was a genius Explorer who was actually able to withstand an attack of four Cruisers. Although the four had not used their full strength, not even a normal Cruiser would have been able to resist that combined attack without suffering injuries, let alone an Explorer. This person was definitely an expert at the very top of the Top Hundred Battle Rankings, and was someone who even surpassed Wendy Yushan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had specifically checked once before and verified that Wendy Yushan had not yet become a Cruiser and that she was still an Explorer. Despite that, she had still used her own strength to become the captain of the Second Imperial Squadron and had once defeated a Cruiser.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Long Yun? That’s a familiar name. He’s one of the human powerhouses that has a ‘must kill’ status on the Heaven-Devouring list. It’s disgusting to see that someone like that is here as well!” the Ghost Monkey shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun’s sword had not only shocked the entire capital, but it had also saved those who had arrived with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides the two unlucky fellows who had dropped directly into the capital, the rest had escaped, and Wu Shang had run away as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This angered Bei Zhigui greatly, as Wu Shang had definitely been a foreigner. Those experts who had suddenly appeared on the List of Tempering out of nowhere were also possibly foreigners, yet only Wu Shang had the confidence to challenge them. He had also only recently joined the Ming Constables. Clearly, he was also a foreigner. What a pity it was that he had slipped away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ming Constables had always strictly examined every member who joined the Ming Vanguard, and even if Lu Yin had a stamp of approval from the previous court master, the Ming Constables would still investigate whatever they could. Lu Yin himself had nearly been discovered as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The top ranker of the List of Tempering had never been revealed, but that might just be a strategy devised by Crown Prince Ming Hao to reveal any foreigners who tried to challenge the List of Tempering. The leader would simply challenge whoever was suspect, which meant that they always had some insurance in the form of a peak powerhouse who was so terrifying that few could withstand them at the top of the list.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the List of Tempering had been created by the crown prince, he definitely preferred to leave no loopholes than let the Ming Constables take advantage of it. Lu Yin had just realized this logic, but it seemed that Wu Shang had only thought of it after leaving the city. Unfortunately, he had been noticed by Bei Zhigui and would have been in great danger if not for Long Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ten days quickly passed by, during which Lu Yin made a great contribution. He captured a trialtaker who was from the Innerverse’s Blazing Mist Flowzone on behalf of the Ming Constables. If someone had a good reputation within the Blaze Realm, then they were automatically an enemy of Lu Yin’s. He showed no mercy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ming Constables had established itself with the sole goal of slaughtering trialtakers, but not many were uncovered each year. As time passed, the trialtakers had gradually learned how to conceal and hide themselves better, which meant that the Ming Constables was rarely able to capture trialtakers alive. Thus, Lu Yin’s contribution caused Ming Zhaochen to praise him lavishly. As Lu Yin had already demonstrated sufficient strength, he was directly promoted to a deputy commander under Li Zimo’s command.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin simply did not believe that Ming Zhaochen would promote him that easily without ulterior motives—perhaps he wanted to use Li Zimo to silently monitor Lu Yin. Lu Yin was not bothered by this in any case, as he had always been planning on using the Ming Constables to deal with the Daynight clan’s members. Doing so would even gain him contributions from the Ming Constables.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Zimo was a naturally cold person who was an expert in the sword. His entire body resembled a sharp, unsheathed blade; he openly revealed his danger and ability, but he never hurt anyone. It was as if he had concealed his aura within a very confined space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu was very talented with the sword, but he had a subdued aura even though he had mastered a sword technique similar to the Thirteen Swords. This Li Zimo was number two on the List of Tempering, so his strength could not be overlooked. However, his sword technique was unknown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin dared not remain too close to the man, for fear that he might detect Lu Yin’s true strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“For now, we’ll head out with three people each to provide security for the Reverent King's Palace,” Li Zimo informed Lu Yin after receiving a mission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was shocked. “The Reverent King's Palace?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Reverent King's Palace is not far from the imperial palace. Let’s go,” Li Zimo replied indifferently. He then led six people from the Ming Vanguard towards the king’s palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin never thought that he would return to the Reverent King's household this soon. Fortunately, he had changed his appearance prior to joining the Ming Constables, or else he would be definitely recognized by the Reverent King's household members.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The palace was rather courteous to the Ming Constables members, and they requested them to protect the backdoor. This also meant that the Ming Vanguard members could escort any important members of the household to safety if so needed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Highness, the crown prince has ordered the Ming Vanguard to protect our Reverent King's Palace. Is he trying to monitor us?” Tang Si asked solemnly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Zhaoshu shook his head. “He’s not that stupid. He’s only doing this as a show for others. He wants to prove that our uncle-nephew relationship is harmonious. He’s actually rather invested in this, to the point where the Ming Constables even deployed a commander this time.”</span></p>
