 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We can’t enter it, since the space around this planet has been sealed. If an anomaly, like a spacecraft, shows up there, it will automatically be attacked,” someone answered apprehensively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin frowned. “There’s an Explorer guarding this space?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded. “Invite that Explorer onto the ship. Tell them that you’ve been taken over.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd was stunned, and everyone was baffled by Lu Yin’s words. But when Lu Yin glared at them, they quickly complied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a bit of time, a powerful aura shrouded the spacecraft. Lu Yin continued staring at the screen while also occasionally checking his gadget. It was about time to try calling Xia Luo again, and he hoped that Alfonso had held up his end of the deal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin did not control the people on the vessel and allowed everyone to leave the captain’s room. Before long, an Explorer entered and stared at Lu Yin’s back. His face was downcast. “You’re the one who seized this spacecraft?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin turned around. “That’s me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Explorer looked at Lu Yin. He was confused at first, but then he grew shocked. He muttered to himself for a bit and then turned around to face the others. “Take this gentleman wherever he wants to go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crewmembers were stunned. “But our mission is to observe this planet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Explorer gloomily replied, “Cancel the mission and immediately escort this gentleman to wherever he wishes to go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Understood.” The others were still bewildered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded appreciatively. “Thank you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Explorer forced out a smile and then left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A short time later, that Explorer stood at the bottom of the oceanic trench as he watched the spacecraft ascend and depart from the planet. His eyes flickered as he said to himself, “So he’s actually still alive. He somehow survived the storm and even managed to arrive in Zhengyang Flowzone. It’s too much to believe that he did all that himself, so there has to be some super powerhouse guarding him. He can’t be offended, but that means that Chaos Flowzone is about to get exciting. I hope that he’ll fight with Ling Que so that we can see if he really is qualified to be considered as one of the four unequalled Limiteers.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhengyang Flowzone was close to Daynight Flowzone, so its denizens had closely followed the news about the Daynight Feast. Hence, this Explorer had quickly recognized Lu Yin, though this might not have happened if Lu Yin had ended up in a more distant flowzone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In outer space, Lu Yin activated his gadget and tried to contact Xia Luo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Luo’s figure soon appeared on Lu Yin’s screen with a beaming smile. “So it turns out that you really are still alive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded. “How’re you guys doing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’re still alright. They haven’t discovered who we are yet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What about our two seniors?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Captured, but don’t worry. Many other people on Deep Crimson Planet were captured as well, so they were just unlucky,” Xia Luo said with a shrug.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, got it. I heard that Deep Crimson Planet’s been sealed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There was a group that risked their lives to break into Deep Crimson Planet, and they even crash-landed their spacecraft, so the seal’s been temporarily broken. However, it will be up again soon. Brother Lu, you chose the perfect time to contact me,” Xia Luo said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin promptly replied, “I’m in Zhengyang Flowzone, so I’ll arrive at Chaos Flowzone soon. We’ll join forces so that you all can escape from Deep Crimson Planet then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s not going to be easy. There’s animosity between the Deep Crimson Hall and our two seniors. They want revenge, so it won’t be easy to convince them to leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s head hurt. “The Deep Crimson Hall’s Bo Duo are both Hunters. Our seniors won’t be able to get their revenge just by themselves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Luo spread his hands. “They don’t have a choice since they couldn’t take it any longer. Our seniors have already assassinated four influential figures from Deep Crimson Hall, which angered the Bo Duo enough into sealing Deep Crimson Planet. All space-exploring foreigners have been captured.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin muttered something to himself and then said, “Tell our two seniors that there’ll be plenty of opportunities to take revenge in the future. I’ll take them away by force if necessary.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Luo nodded. “I’ll try. Meng Yue and Zhao Yilong have already snuck into their holding area, and they should have regrouped by now. We’ll wait for you to get here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded and then disconnected from the call. He looked at the space outside the vessel; every cultivator in the universe had their own conflicts and enemies. Lu Yin’s own enemy was even more terrifying, as they were one of the Ten Arbiters. He could not blindly take revenge and had to plan everything out step by step.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin believed that even Pirate King Highsage Leon would not be able to help Lu Yin take revenge. Even when the Ten Arbiters’ power and trump cards were taken out of consideration, they were incredibly influential, and each one had countless powers backing them. Their authority was enormous; just the title of the Ten Arbiters alone was enough to mobilize half of the universe, and that was just a conservative estimate. It was this authority that attracted so many youths to join the Ten Arbiters Council.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This organization held great authority over the younger generation, but they segregated their members and only accepted others members of the younger generation. Lu Yin wanted to take his revenge on the Ten Arbiters, but it would be a very arduous path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Pao and Little Pao’s enemies were just this Bo Duo. If Lu Yin wished it, then he could just rely on just his own influence to take care of these two. However, his first priority was to make it to Deep Crimson Planet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he had other urgent tasks that also needed to be done, and Lu Yin focused his attention on his gadget once again. Soon, Nightking Yuanjing appeared on his screen with a delighted expression on his face. “Little Yin, you’re alive?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin knew that the old man was not actually happy to see Lu Yin alive. If he held no value, then Nightking Yuanjing would not care if Lu Yin was still alive. Lu Yin understood his position perfectly well, but he still had to put on an act. Thus, he put on a remorseful expression and replied, “Grandpa Yuanjing, I’ve worried you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing looked at Lu Yin in amazement. “Little Yin, were you swallowed by the storm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing’s eyes flashed. “Then how did you get out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin appeared dazed. “I don't know. I don’t have any memory of the time I was inside the storm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing was disappointed, but at the same time, not surprised. Those who had survived similar storms in the past had similarly lost all memory related to their time in the storm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How’s your body? Did anything happen?” Nightking Yuanjing asked in concern, truly playing the perfect part of a benevolent elder.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin put on an agonized look. “I was injured, but nothing too serious. Thank you, Grandpa Yuanjing, for your concern. Little Yin failed to meet Grandpa Yuanjing’s expectations, and I did not manage to make it to the Daynight Feast in time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing shook a hand. “As long as you’re alright, nothing else matters.” He then paused before looking directly at Lu Yin. “Right, Little Yin, have you remembered anything else concerning the Great Realm of Nothingness?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin appeared astonished. “The Great Realm of Nothingness? I’ve already told you all that I know. I did not hide anything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing looked at Lu Yin with clear expectation written on his face. “Really? Nothing else? Nothing about that ancient Void Wanderer elder? Is there any way to deal with it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was at a loss. “The ancient Void Wanderer elder? I don't know anything about it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing stared closely at Lu Yin’s eyes and then sighed. He was clearly disappointed. “It’s alright. If you remember anything else, make sure to tell Grandpa Yuanjing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin sincerely replied, “Rest assured, Grandpa Yuanjing, Little Yin will definitely tell you everything that I know.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing nodded and then disconnected from the call.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin relaxed, as he was afraid that Nightking Yuanjing might have had a falling out with him on the spot. Fortunately, such old fellows had some manners and maintained their dignity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this also meant that Lu Yin was now worthless in Nightking Yuanjing’s eyes, and the old man would no longer restrict Nightqueen Yanqing just for Lu Yin. He frowned, as he now needed to think of some other method to increase his value in Nightking Yuanjing’s eyes. Otherwise, Frostwave Weave would become an endless battlefield since Nightqueen Yanqing could invite countless experts to deal with the Great Yu Empire at her whim.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were many important things that he had to do right now. The Great Yu Empire’s economy was deteriorating from the embargos, and Nightqueen Yanqing had kept her eyes on it this entire time. At this moment, Big Pao and Little Pao required help to be rescued, and Lu Yin still needed to figure out a way to earn more money. All of these matters were important, especially the one concerning earning money. Lu Yin needed to reach the peak of the Limiteer realm as soon as possible. He did not want to accumulate his power slowly like others and only reach the peak of the realm after several years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As long as Lu Yin didn’t become an Explorer, the universe would continue to be an obstacle that he could not step past. The ability to move freely throughout the universe was something that all cultivators desired.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin pondered for a long time, and then he decided to think of ways to improve his Lockbreaker identity after first rescuing Big Pao and Little Pao. That would help him earn more money as well as improve his status. After that, it might be possible to have a chat with the alluring Madam Nalan and borrow some of her family’s enormous wealth to support the Great Yu Empire. That was a matter that could be discussed after they unified Frostwave Weave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right, there was also Bushtree Planet as well. As long as Lu Yin had enough money, that planet would be how he would drastically improve his own power at a mind-boggling rate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he thought about various things, the spacecraft flew onto the Tributary Ark and crossed the Astral River Tributary to arrive in Chaos Flowzone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Tributary Arks were not as large as the Astral River Ark, but they were not small either. Each one could transport at least 10,000 spacecraft, and the small battle spacecraft that Lu Yin had seized was just one more to them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he watched the Astral River Tributary roar by outside, Lu Yin looked forward to visiting the Cosmic Sea. Ye Xingchen’s prestige had been established in the Cosmic Sea, though few had witnessed his power. However, just roaming about the Cosmic Sea was enough to rank him among the top four Limiteers of the younger generation, which clearly demonstrated the Cosmic Sea’s danger compared to the Innerverse and Outerverse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monkey was right; Lu Yin should organize a team and travel to the Cosmic Sea. Exploring the Cosmic Sea was something that everyone with passion would want to do some time in their life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the ark, each spacecraft was fixed onto a rail. Once they arrived at the other side, the rail would extend out of the ark, allowing the spacecraft inside to depart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Generally, only a few people would exit their spacecraft to enter the rail, but there were always a few exceptions. The rails were very safe, and there were also many special services aboard the arks, which provided various pleasures that many people were obsessed with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stood in the captain’s room and looked out at the occasional spacecraft that streaked by, and he saw that almost every single one of them had beauties aboard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Lu Yin was a little aroused since he had never experienced it before. Still, he held no real interest in such things. He suddenly thought of Ming Yan and wondered how she was doing. After such a long period of separation, would her initial feelings still be there?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He browsed through some information regarding Darkmist Weave on his gadget. The powers like the Mafioso Planet, Battle Street, and the Nine Allied Nations were still embroiled with Darkstar Gorge, but it seemed like they had reached some sort of agreement since tensions had recently eased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes flickered, and he felt like he should fan the flames some more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Lu Yin saw a familiar figure, but he was stumped by who it was. After a moment, he remembered.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Isn’t that the Mad Viper Knight?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, when Lu Yin had robbed the Mad Viper Knight Pirate Group, Zhuo Daynight had accidentally been injured. The events after, where he had taken care of her, had led Lu Yin to the pirate port, and later on, to Driftcharge Planet. The Mad Viper Knight had escaped back then, and Lu Yin had never dreamed that he would run into him at such a place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without hesitation, Lu Yin gave chase and shuttled down the railway at extreme speed. He chased after the Mad Viper Knight, but he did not know why he wanted to eliminate this person. It was possible that it was some form of revenge for Zhuo Daynight even though it had been Lu Yin himself who had injured her back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mad Viper Knight was different compared to when he had been in the Outerverse; he had now broken through and was now an Explorer. He was all alone in his spacecraft, cruising along in a certain direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin chased after him from a distance, not at all worried about being discovered since the Mad Viper Knight did not have the ability to discover him.</span></p>
