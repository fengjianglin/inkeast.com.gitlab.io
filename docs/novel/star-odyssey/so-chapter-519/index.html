Even Wendy Yushan, who should have been taking care of East Saint Dios, had appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her arrival was something that nobody expected. She did not join hands with any faction, which meant that she did not have a star essence skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanbing Daynight seemed to turn serious as he looked at her in a guarded manner.</span></p>

Without a star essence skin, even the most powerful Explorer would be fated to explode and die. This woman was far too reckless!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">News of the battles on Planet Pyrolyte had been sealed off by the various powers. While there had been some videos that leaked out, no one aside from them actually knew what was going on here. The same went for Wendy Yushan. This was the purpose of information. People who had it would gain the upper hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan was powerful, but she did not know what was going on this planet. Appearing out of nowhere was as good as dying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan directed her eyes to the ground. The reason why she had been in such a rush to come here was because of Lu Yin, the only person she acknowledged as a member of her family. She didn’t want him to die.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a bang, the ground cracked, and Lu Yin leaped up as he charged into the sky.</span></p>

I know that all of my attacks landed. He had to have died there! How can this be? Did he actually manage to block all of my attacks?</span></p>

He pulled out a star essence skin and ordered, “Wear it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This skin had belonged to Ze Lin, and Lu Yin was currently incredibly glad that he hadn’t sold it off. Otherwise, Wendy Yushan would die for sure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had no idea why she had to wear the thing, but she put it on without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ze Lin’s star essence skin wasn’t enough to completely protect her, but so long as she did not use too much power, she would be fine for now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin heaved a heavy sigh of relief, but then he glared at her. “How can you be so reckless? Don’t you know that Explorers can’t just enter Planet Pyrolyte as they please? There’s aerosolized pyrolyte everywhere, even in the air! If you breathe it in, you could explode!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan stared at Lu Yin while Lu Yin did the same, though he appeared to be absolutely fuming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, Wendy Yushan casually glanced away. “I got it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t say anything except by using star energy to make the air vibrate!” Lu Yin exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan made a sound of acknowledgement and then really stopped talking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everybody watched their interactions in a daze. This was an expert who was ranked eighteenth on the Top 100 Rankings, so why was she letting herself be reprimanded in such a manner?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Lu Yin himself was shocked. He’d been prepared for her to give him the cold shoulder, but she hadn’t done that and was instead being very obedient. What the hell?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nobody knew what she was thinking, but ever since Lu Yin had given her the Yu Secret Art, she had decided in her heart that Lu Yin was the only family member she had left in this universe. Thus, he was the only one who was allowed to get mad at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had been at Saint Dios when she heard about how Lu Yin had been threatened by an Enlighter holding the Great Yu Empire hostage, and she had also heard a bit about the battles on Planet Pyrolyte. From these matters, Lu Yin’s place in her heart had grown once again. This was because Lu Yin showed that he truly regarded the Great Yu Empire as his home, and it wasn’t just his home, but also hers as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Wendy Yushan might appear to be fine even after losing everyone in her Yushan family, that was only because her grief was hidden too deeply. Lu Yin was now the only family that she had left in the universe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also the reason why she had rushed over to Planet Pyrolyte without even considering her own safety. She did not want to lose her family ever again. The universe was much too big, dark, and cold. She needed to preserve the bit of warmth that she still had in her heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you doing here?” Lu Yin asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan kept her eye on Zhanbing Daynight, who was in the distance. “It was on the way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was speechless.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is the Astral Wilderness. On the way? To where?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked at her seriously. Just now, she’d seemed anxious and worried. She had probably come for him. He couldn’t help but feel touched at the thought. From the time he began cultivating until now, how many people had risked their lives for him? How many had even been worried about him? This was kinship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan took a step forward. “What should I do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes flashed coldly, and he looked at Zhanbing Daynight with merciless eyes. “Kill him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanbing Daynight’s actions made Lu Yin want to kill him. Since the other party had intended to kill him, then he wasn’t going to hold back. So what if this person was from the Daynight clan? Lu Yin was not someone who would let another person kill him just because he was scared of the Daynight clan. Besides, Zhanbing Daynight had nearly succeeded in his task.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan started to unsheathe her sword, and Zhanbing Daynight’s pupils shrank. He immediately charged up towards outer space. One of them was ranked fifty fifth while the other was ranked eighteenth on the Top 100 Rankings. The gap between them was just too vast. Zhanbing Daynight was not at all confident in being able to block her attacks even with the limitation that she could not use her full strength due to the limitations of her current star essence skin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a whoosh, her sword was completely unsheathed, and a cold glint immediately illuminated the entire region. No matter how quick one was, or even if one hid in the void, there was no way to dodge this sword. This was Ten Thousand Swords In One. The style of Myriad Swords Peak was incredibly simple: there was just one attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanbing Daynight’s body hung in the sky, completely still. He seemed to be dazed, and his eyes eventually glazed over. His weapons then disappeared one by one as his entire body smashed onto the ground. He was completely dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With just one attack, Wendy had killed Zhanbing Daynight. This was her strength. This was the strength of someone in the top twenty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everybody was frozen in place. Zhanbing Daynight was the first powerhouse in the Top 100 Rankings to have died here. The battles on Planet Pyrolyte were so vicious that even somebody with such an impressive level of strength wasn’t guaranteed to survive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Above the planet, Nightqueen Qiuyu was furious, but there was nothing that she could do about this. She no longer had anything that she could use to threaten Wendy Yushan as Frostwave Weave was now under the Sea King Dome’s protection. Unless the Daynight clan declared war on the Sea King, their clan elders would not intervene. This matter could only be handled by those in the younger generation. However, given Wendy Yushan’s strength, how many people in the Daynight clan were qualified to be her opponents? And what’s more, who could actually kill her?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan’s arrival had instantly made her the strongest being on Planet Pyrolyte for the moment. She was ranked in the top twenty of the Top 100 Rankings, and that was a height that only a few Explorers could reach. Unless Cruisers were able to descend onto the planet, Wendy would stand firmly at the peak for quite some time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that battle just now, there had been one thing that even the major powers were unable to understand. How had Lu Yin managed to block all of Zhanbing Daynight’s attacks without suffering from any injuries? It was very strange.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Wendy Yushan’s appearance had been too much of a surprise, so no one even had a chance to mention the matter of Lu Yin’s survival. Still, it wasn’t like they had completely forgotten about the matter either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing and the rest immediately fled without even grabbing Zhanbing Daynight’s corpse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin saw what they were doing, but after thinking it over, he ultimately decided against giving chase. There was no point in offending that clan any more than he already had, unless he was planning on actually joining the Sea King’s Dome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin went and retrieved Zhanbing Daynight’s star essence skin before having Wendy Yushan change into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She did not protest and returned the one that had belonged to Ze Lin afterwards. However, Lu Yin did not want it. “Wear them both. Even two might not even be enough to protect you completely. Having another one as a backup is also a good idea. Also, if you need to fight again, make sure you don’t use too much of your strength.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually… I think that it might be better if you head back. It’s too dangerous here,” he stated. He wasn’t worried that Wendy wasn’t strong enough. Rather, he was worried that she might explode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s fine. I know what I’m doing,” Wendy Yushan answered nonchalantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin did not press the issue and took her to the mountain range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Above the planet, Hai Dashao heaved a sigh of relief that he hadn’t been too late. The news regarding Lu Yin had been leaked to Wendy Yushan by the Sea King. Otherwise, there was no way that she would have found out. Everything had been a part of Elder Tong’s plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His plan had taken all sorts of unexpected elements into account. Actually, if Lu Yin did not have a star essence skin, then Elder Ren would have forcefully taken Wendy off of the planet. In his eyes, rules were made to be broken. They wouldn’t sit there and watch her die, but the current situation was for the best.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She possesses an interesting innate gift! She’d be a good match for you,” Elder Ren said as he looked at Wendy in appreciation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Dashao was also looking at her. She was definitely pretty and completely his type.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While he was looking at the planet, Elder Ren’s expression suddenly changed, and he became grim. “Go and have some fun with Avery.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Dashao’s eyes shone. “Is he attempting to go down to Planet Pyrolyte?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Ren nodded. “Elder Tong anticipated everything. That girl’s not somebody whom a regular person can deal with. The Blaze Realm, Ross Empire, and Dire Barbarian Clan have decided to work together to make a star essence skin for Avery so that he can go down to the planet and attack her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Dashao grinned. “Got it,” he said before vanishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On Planet Pyrolyte, Lu Yin found that Hai Qiqi had disappeared. He checked with Ah Fan and the rest, but nobody knew where she had gone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was no wonder why he hadn’t seen her on the sidelines while he’d been fighting. Lu Yin wasn’t worried about her since there were elders from the Sea King’s Dome above the planet. Besides, Hai Qiqi wasn’t weak herself, and she probably had a number of means to protect herself. All Lu Yin knew for sure was that the Sea King had been absolutely confident that Lu Yin didn’t need to protect Qiqi. Thus, she probably was at least as capable as Lu Yin in keeping herself safe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Lie and the others looked at Wendy Yushan in curiosity. She was in the top twenty of the Top 100 Rankings, but she was very young—even younger than the Ten Arbiters. Once they grew old enough to no longer be considered a part of the younger generation, Wendy Yushan would become one of the top ten on the ranking. Such a thought was terrifying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When had the people from the Northline Flowzone ever had the chance to be so close to somebody so powerful?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lily Anne tried to butter up to Wendy with her elegant demeanor, but unfortunately, such behavior had no effect whatsoever on Wendy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin chased everyone away and quietly asked, “How’s your practice for&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">that&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">going?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was speechless. “Then what do you know?”</span></p>

What he actually wanted to know was who had taken Wendy to Myriad Sword Peaks, but he didn’t know how to bring such a question up.&nbsp;</span></p>

Something swept over them like a huge gale, nearly causing the atmosphere itself to be destroyed.</span></p>
