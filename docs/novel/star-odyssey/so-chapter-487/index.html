Zhuo Daynight soon returned underground, where she consumed more of the Shamrock Enterprises’ special medicines before continuing to rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One day passed, and then two more days passed. When Zhuo Daynight awoke once again, she estimated the time that had gone and realized that three days had passed. By now, she had absorbed as much star energy from star crystals as she could to heal herself. Her condition had finally taken a turn for the better, but she still had not returned to her peak state yet. But for now, she would be able to protect herself, and she did not want to hide any longer. She had to find the other Daynight clan members, but she did not know which power was currently in control of Pyrolyte Mountain. The Sword Sect? Or the Daynight clan?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she emerged from under the ground, she could sense multiple auras approaching her through her domain. Zhuo Daynight quickly hid in the shadows and watched on as some cultivators appeared before gradually vanishing into the distance. They were headed towards Pyrolyte Mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She did not hesitate to immediately follow after them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight had escaped with heavy injuries, so she had not strayed too far away from Pyrolyte Mountain to begin with. When she saw a huge crack in the ground, she knew that Pyrolyte Mountain must be close by since this crevice had most likely been formed during the confrontation between Liu Shaoqiu and Zhanlong Daynight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ground trembled once again. This time, the tremors were accompanied by an intense gale. Zhuo Daynight’s face changed, as this was an undulation of star energy; another battle had broken out at Pyrolyte Mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, it should be either the Sword Sect or the Daynight clan attacking Pyrolyte Mountain since no other organizations could possibly stand up to those two . That meant that the Daynight clan should be at the mountain right now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight did not dare to abandon her clan’s missions, and she was well aware that all her actions were being monitored. If she did not participate in the battle, then she would face difficult times once she returned to the clan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, two figures streaked through the sky, both Limiteers. They noticed Zhuo Daynight and exchanged glances before they both attacked her at the same time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were disciples from an organization in the First Flowzone, which meant that they naturally followed the Sword Sect and were moving against the Daynight clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, they were too weak. Although their strength was decent within the scope of the younger generation, they were still lacking compared to Zhuo Daynight, who had comprehended a domain. She easily dispatched them, leaving one of the two alive for questioning. “What’s the situation at Pyrolyte Mountain like?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surviving Limiteer fearfully answered, “The Daynight clan, Wen family, Souldream Tribe, and quite a few other powers from smaller flowzones have started a war at Pyrolyte Mountain. They want to force the Sword Sect to share the mountain’s pyrolyte. The battle should have started about two hours ago.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight had not expected the battle to be this intense. Apparently, nearly half of the great powers on the planet were participating in the contest for Pyrolyte Mountain. The Sword Sect had Liu Shaoqiu, and numbers were meaningless against his Second Sword. What did that woman Nightqueen Yanqing have that gave her the confidence to launch another attack? Had reinforcements arrived?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight had not guessed wrongly, as the Wen family had invited Ling Que, and he had arrived at Planet Pyrolyte slightly earlier than Mu Rong. Nightqueen Yanqing and the others had been planning this attack for days, and they intended to use this small window of opportunity to seize Pyrolyte Mountain. After that, the various powerful organizations could unite and force the Sword Sect to split the benefits. When Mu Rong arrived, he would not be able to reverse the situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The current battle on Pyrolyte Mountain was more intense than any other previous battle on the planet. The site of Liu Shaoqiu and Zhanlong Daynight’s battle had moved to the northern side of Pyrolyte Mountain since they were too ferocious and the aftershocks too intense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Liu Xiaoyun and Kuang Wang were battling at the base of Pyrolyte Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Nightqueen Yanqing had been severely injured by Liu Shaoqiu, she had received critical care along with the resources of the entire Daynight clan. Thus, she had been able to recover enough to participate in the battle again, just like Liu Xiaoyun.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sword Sect was able to withstand Nightqueen Yanqing’s assault purely because of one person: Yōu Ye'er.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She only looked to be around eleven or twelve years old, just a petite girl, but when her strength erupted, it caused everyone’s brows to shoot up. She had forcibly delayed Nightqueen Yanqing, and even when the latter activated her Nightking’s Body and battle force, she still was not able to take Yōu Ye'er down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only was the Daynight clan astounded, but even Liu Shaoqiu was shocked at Yōu Ye'er’s strength. The Yōu Court had sent more than just Yōu Ye'er, and there were a few other Yōu Court Limiteers who were older but very strong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was this alliance between the Sword Sect and the Yōu Court that allowed them to withstand the combined force of the opposing alliance, which included the Daynight clan, Wen family, and Souldream Tribe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this deadlock would not last for much longer. Nightqueen Yanqing’s plans hinged around Ling Que. As soon as he arrived, Pyrolyte Mountain would once again change hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right now, Nightqueen Yanqing could only glare at the little girl blocking her way with a vengeful hatred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old aunty, you can’t go on, right? If you can, then bring it on!” Yōu Ye'er was clad in a black mandara dress, giving her an innocent look despite the mischievous grin she was directing towards Yanqing. She smiled, and although the little girl was cute and adorable, her ridiculing expression made Nightqueen Yanqing instinctively desire to tear Ye’er to pieces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who would have thought that she would be stopped here by such a little brat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can’t hold out much longer, stupid brat. Wait till I catch you! I’ll hang you up and beat you senseless!” Nightqueen Yanqing roared, her eyes flickering with a purple radiance. Yōu Ye'er’s eyes gleamed as she immediately retreated away from Nightqueen Yanqing, who charged at her with an impressive speed. However, the surroundings suddenly changed and isolated her from everyone else. A courtyard had appeared on all sides of Yanqing, a strange one that was formed from star energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the Yōu clan’s inherited battle technique—the Encompassing Lockdown Array. Four sides combined to form a single court that could entrap any cultivator, as long as the disparity in strength was not too great. Fortunately, despite Yōu Ye'er’s young looks, she was also a Limiteer, and she was not weak either. With her power, the Encompassing Lockdown Array was able to completely contain Nightqueen Yanqing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Encompassing Lockdown Array was not as famous as the Wen family’s Literary Prison, Nightqueen Yanqing would never belittle it. This was because the Yōu Court had originally been a part of an absolutely terrifying supreme power, and they had even been one of the Court of Seven Names’ core powers. Even if they had betrayed and broken away from that power, they had inherited the strength of that family, and the Encompassing Lockdown Array was something that they had received from that family.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Xiaoyun’s battle against Kuang Wang had not ended yet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xi Yue and Wen Qian'er had gained the upper hand in their own battles, and suppressing the disciples of the Sword Sect. Given enough time, they would win a complete victory and would be able to force the Sword Sect to retreat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The greatest variable in this battle was Liu Shaoqiu, but he was currently preoccupied with Zhanlong Daynight. Although Zhanlong Daynight could not beat the genius swordsman, Liu Shaoqiu could not emerge victorious anytime soon either, since the two were evenly matched. This stalemate gave the others enough time to play key roles in the overall situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The odds of victory were starting to lean towards the Daynight clan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From a distance away, sword qi shot over every once in a while, terrifying many of the combatants and prompting them to move further away. The battle between Liu Shaoqiu and Zhanlong Daynight was still the most terrifying one on the entire battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight arrived right outside of Pyrolyte Mountain, where she saw a chaotic battle involving more than a thousand people. The entire region around Pyrolyte Mountain had been turned into a chaotic battlefield, and fresh blood had long since stained the ground scarlet red.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Hua had already reached his limits, and he was barely able to keep his grip on his sword any longer. In front of him, Tiankong Daynight and Chilian Daynight were attacking him together. With one more barrage, Yan Hua was finally unable to hold out any longer, and he collapsed to the ground. It was unknown if he was dead or alive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many disciples from the Sword Sect had already perished, and the Wen family had suffered numerous casualties as well. Even Wen Qian'er was injured. She had joined forces with Xi Yue and was standing with her while panting heavily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight could tell that the Sword Sect was about to be defeated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In space, above the planet, a satisfied smile broke out across Nightqueen Qiuyu’s face. Even if Pyrolyte Mountain did not ultimately end up belonging to the Daynight clan alone, the Sword Sect would have to forget about retaining control. The two parties were on the same level, so neither one of them could think about hogging it all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Nightqueen Qiuyu received some news, and her expression became delighted. The battle was about to end. She looked into the distance where a personal spacecraft was barrelling towards Pyrolyte Mountain. Ling Que had finally arrived.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyu watched Ling Que’s spacecraft streak past her, but then another spacecraft charged towards Planet Pyrolyte. She looked on and suddenly had a strange feeling. What was that?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Trailing right behind Ling Que’s spacecraft was the group of professional cheerleaders. There was no place these women wouldn’t go to since Ling Que had promised to protect them. The more dangerous the place was, the greater their pay was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyu had an ugly expression. She had lived for a long time, but this was the first time she had encountered such a scene. Should she stop them?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While she was hesitating, the two spacecraft crash landed on Planet Pyrolyte. They landed rather close to Pyrolyte Mountain and were seen by many people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing was delighted. She recognized Ling Que’s spacecraft and knew that this battle was about to reach its finale. Now, they just needed to complete taking over Pyrolyte Mountain before Mu Rong arrived, as well as leave Liu Shaoqiu and the rest severely injured. That way, even if Mu Rong rushed over, he still would not be able to reverse such a grim situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To the north of Pyrolyte Mountain, Liu Shaoqiu and Zhanlong Daynight turned around simultaneously. They had a sort of apprehension that could not be easily explained, but it was as if they had met another one of their own kind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yōu Ye'er’s face changed. “Old aunty, what are you thinking about? Stop dreaming! You still can’t beat me no matter what you try.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing sneered, but she stopped attacking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Xiaoyun stood still and held onto her sword while Kuang Wang sat on the body of his azure dragon opposite her as he also looked over. “For now, we can’t determine which of us is stronger.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Xiaoyun did not bother looking at him. Instead, she wordlessly stared into the distance at where the spacecraft had just landed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hatch opened, and Ling Que walked out. The other spacecraft’s hatch also opened at the same time, and the cheerleaders frantically roared out. The various great powers in outer space stared at the scene, dumbfounded. Even this was possible?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ling Que, Ling Que, I love you! Ling Que, Ling Que, you’re the best!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ling Que, Ling Que, I love you! Ling Que, Ling Que, you’re the best!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que let out a sigh of contentment as he looked over at his crazed cheerleaders.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What a beautiful sight. Yes, act even more crazy and shout even more. Such things will eventually belong to me.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;He then sharply turned his gaze towards Pyrolyte Mountain and took a light step forward, but that movement caused his entire body to suddenly vanish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cheerleaders excitedly dashed after him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Ling Que even arrived at the mountain, vast amounts of star energy swept out through his Que’s Might Slash, the blade’s unique sharpness engulfing all of Pyrolyte Mountain. Whether it was Nightqueen Yanqing, Yōu Ye'er, Liu Xiaoyun, Zhuo Daynight, or even the distant Liu Shaoqiu and Zhanlong Daynight, they could all clearly feel that terrifyingly sharp energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone looked up at Ling Que, who was towering above them, high in the sky. The entire battlefield froze.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que’s lips curled up, as this was precisely the effect he wanted to have, so he did not find it wasteful to expend such an enormous amount of star energy on this. This was the entrance he deserved. He would treat the events at the Sea King’s Dome as a nightmare, something that he did not want to be reminded of for the rest of his life. Especially those two freaks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“From now on, this place belongs to me.” Ling Que’s calm voice reverberated across Pyrolyte Mountain, and his eyes slowly scanned across everyone there. He did not care if they belonged to the Sword Sect or the Daynight clan; he had been invited to help the Wen family.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kuang Wang was the first to grow unhappy; this chap was even more arrogant than himself. “Which noob are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que looked over at Kuang Wang, and when he saw the majestic azure dragon, an expression of disdain flashed across his mouth. He casually raised a hand, causing his Que's Mighty Slash to flash out. The next moment, everyone stared blankly at Kuang Wang, who slowly fell down. There was now a massive stain where blood was dying his clothes red. Everyone went numb at the sight. Kuang Wang’s azure dragon howled in anguish as it vanished in front of the onlookers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the entire region around Pyrolyte Mountain fell silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That person was Kuang Wang, a genius child from the Divine Grade Hall, and one of the Astral Combat Academy’s Realm Masters. He had been the strongest person on Planet Pyrolyte for a period of time, but he had not been able to withstand that single strike.</span></p>
