 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-d4d2cb20-7fff-3723-2913-c2fe4c194cb0"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrial took Lu Yin to a place they could directly observe the five sealing planets, which also happened to be&nbsp;where he had previously requested Wen Sansi to evaluate his trial results. From here, one could go straight to Shenwu Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Over the course of many years, many experts from Darkmist Weave had shed their blood there, which had reinforced the prestige of the five sealing planets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While making their way up to the observation room, Lu Yin did not run into anyone from the Daynight clan besides one. It would seem that the clan members had been forbidden from approaching Lu Yin, and the only person he saw was Zhanlong Daynight. Lu Yin had not expected that this person would be at the space station.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin quickly learned that the Daynight clan had occupied the eastern region of the Darkmist Weave as well as that Zhanlong Daynight did not follow Nightqueen Qiuyu. Instead, he had come here to the space station. It appeared that the distance between the Nightking bloodline and the ordinary members of the Daynight clan was rather vast. No matter how poorly Nightqueen Yanqing’s performance may have been, she would still be kept beside Nightqueen Qiuyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every time the two young men ran into each other, Zhanlong Daynight felt something new from Lu Yin. Their first meeting had been on Shenwu Continent. At that time, Zhanlong Daynight had believed that the difference between him and Lu Yin was not that large. His Daynight Restoration Technique had been suppressed by Lu Yin in the past, but the difference in their strengths had not been overwhelmingly disparate. The second time had been at the Tower of Resonating Light, where Lu Yin had easily defeated the Daynight genius. Their third encounter had been on Planet Pyrolyte, and there, Zhanlong Daynight had personally experienced the indescribable difference between the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, on the space station, Zhanlong Daynight was speechless. It seemed that Lu Yin had killed quite a few Enlighters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter the methods that Lu Yin had employed, even if he relied on foreign objects, attaining an achievement still showed Lu Yin’s ability. Zhanlong Daynight wanted to face him, not to attempt anything, but just to observe Lu Yin up close so that he could find out if this freak had grown stronger once again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The results made him relax slightly, because Lu Yin’s aura had not changed too greatly, and it was about the same as before. This proved that the two’s personal strengths had not changed much since last time, so Zhanlong Daynight felt that there was still a trace of a chance to catch up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two brushed past each other, but Zhanlong Daynight did not speak. Lu Yin did not say anything either. As they passed each other, it would seem that they had had no interactions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he looked at the five sealing planets, Lu Yin’s expression turned to shock when his eyes saw the boundless rune lines. These rune lines far surpassed anything that he had ever seen on an Enlighter. He estimated that these rune lines represented a power level close to 300,000. It was no wonder why these five planets were able to block an Enlighter’s attacks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, how had Wen Sansi managed to penetrate past the five sealing planets to affect Shenwu Continent with just his strength? Lu Yin could not understand this. He had originally thought that the five sealing planets would not be able to stop Wen Sansi, but now, he realized that they were definitely strong enough to do so. Despite that, Wen Sansi had still possessed his own methods that allowed him to influence Shenwu Continent. This demonstrated the might of the Ten Arbiters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is this the place that was chosen as the Outerverse’s last training ground?” Wendy Yushan studied the five sealing planets up and down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded. “That’s right. It’s stunning, isn’t it? One mainland is able to withstand an entire weave, and not even the Innerverse’s powers can do anything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan nodded. “Very amazing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m very curious about something. What’s the issue with this isolated space?” Lu Yin asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrial replied, “The so-called ‘strange space’ is equivalent to a parallel universe.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Parallel universe?” Lu Yin did not understand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrial continued, “According to some studies, all spaces that do not belong to this universe are known as a parallel universe. If you imagine our universe as an endless horizontal line, then a parallel universe would be another parallel line. There are no intersections between the two, but occasionally, because of some strange happenstance, a crossover occurs. This Shenwu Continent appeared because an Enlighter from there tore through the void, which caused it to intersect with our own universe.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is senior saying that there are many parallel universes?” Lu Yin was astounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrial replied, “That, I’m not sure of.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shouldn’t a parallel universe be identical to our universe? Perhaps there’s a time difference,” Wendy Yushan commented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrial shrugged. “There are many theories, but none have been proven to be completely accurate so far. However, it’s impossible to have a completely identical universe like you mentioned. At best, there will only be a fixed region that is identical.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Please elaborate, senior,” Lu Yin requested respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrial continued his explanation, saying, “For instance, if your Great Yu Empire’s Zenyu Star exists in a parallel universe, then there might also be an identical Zenyu Star in that parallel universe. However, there won’t be a completely identical Frostwave Weave. The scope of Zenyu Star in the context of a parallel universe is small. It might also include some surrounding planets, or perhaps even a filament. However, never an entire region of the universe. The people on that parallel Zenyu Star would not be able to explore the universe unless they managed to tear through the void and come to our universe.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That means that, if destiny allows it, if we tore through to that space, so long as that space exists within the parallel universe, we could see another Zenyu Star with copies of ourselves?” Lu Yin was shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrial nodded. “Another Zenyu Star would appear, but the people there would not be replicated. This is because no parallel universe can copy the entire universe. Hence, people who were originally from distant places of the universe would not appear on the parallel Zenyu Star.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin understood. This theory meant that only certain areas could exist in parallel universes, but it would be somewhat caged. If those in that parallel universe wanted to leave, then their only option was to tear through the void and come to their universe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Truthfully, Lu Yin did not believe in such a theory himself, and he felt that Tyrial was talking nonsense. If there truly existed a parallel universe, then there could be an identical universe with himself, Wendy Yushan, Ten Arbiters, and everyone else. How could there only be a planet in the parallel universe? That was no different from a cage!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Perhaps something identical exists in that region of the parallel universe, or perhaps it’s different. For example, in this universe, the region where Shenwu Continent lies was originally just a band of meteorites. It is tantamount to saying that the Enlighter on that mainland pulled Shenwu Continent out from that parallel space,” Tyrial explained.&nbsp;</span></p>

Perhaps, to the true universe, our universe is only a small region.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrial laughed. “That’s impossible, as our universe is too big. It’s practically limitless.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If the people in the parallel universe tear through the void, then would they come to our universe?” Wendy Yushan asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrial muttered, “Perhaps, perhaps not. Nobody knows how many parallel universes there might be. There could be countless numbers, where some include surrounding planets in a very small scope while others may include a filament or even a weave. No one can be sure.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>

If a parallel universe was big enough, then would his copy’s life be the same as what he had experienced in this universe? Such as losing his memory, going to Earth, participating in Astral-10’s trial, and so on?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, the concept of parallel universes was not precise, and there were at least 10,000 different theories. Countless researchers had studied parallel universes, but no one had been able to come up with a solid theory.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was still too early for humans to study the universe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, senior, has anyone from Shenwu Continent left the sealed space?” Lu Yin suddenly enquired.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrial replied, “Of course. We’ve captured quite a few people from Shenwu Continent throughout all these years, but they aren’t very valuable. We already have quite an accurate understanding of how&nbsp;things on Shenwu Continent operate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did Reverent King Ming Zhaoshu send out someone to discuss the details of cooperation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrial’s eyes flickered and he muttered, “There is, but that person was taken away by the Daynight clan, so no one can meet him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who was it?” Lu Yin was curious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Someone called Tang Si.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes lit up. “Take me to him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrial smiled bitterly. “Student Lu, Tang Si has been taken away by the Daynight clan, so we can’t meet him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s fine. Take me to the Daynight clan members,” Lu Yin said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan glanced at him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrial’s face revealed his troubled thoughts, but he still nodded. If Lu Yin was just a normal Limiteer, then the commander of the space station would not even have met with him. If some other Limiteer spoke to him in the same manner as Lu Yin, then Tyrial would be happy to slap the idiot to death. However, Lu Yin was someone who had killed Enlighters, and Tyrial did not wish to offend such a ruthless person.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the space station was large, Tyrial was able to tear through the void. Before long, he brought Lu Yin and Wendy Yushan to the Daynight clan’s section of the space station. Coincidentally, Zhanlong Daynight returned at the same time and bumped into Lu Yin again. He wondered what Lu Yin was doing in their section of the space station.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Please inform Madam Meilan that Tyrial has brought Lu Yin and Wendy Yushan for a visit,” Tyrial spoke courteously to the Daynight guard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Daynight member was arrogant, and although he was only a Limiteer, he haughtily replied, “Wait here.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrial was not angry, as he was only a Hunter from Darkmist Weave’s Nine Allied Nations. He had no right to act superior when speaking to a Daynight clan member.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked around, and through his transformed eyes, he was able to see at least three Hunters inside the Daynight clan’s section of the space station. They certainly lived up to their reputation as one of the universe’s most powerful clans. They were able to casually send out three Hunters on an errand, while the Great Yu Empire only had three Hunters in total.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a long while, that gatekeeper returned. “The madam is resting at the moment. You can return in a few hours.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrial was now placed in a difficult position.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin frowned and then kicked out with a leg, sending the Daynight guard flying back into the interior doors. Another guard grew furious. “How foolhardy!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin casually slapped out and knocked the second guard unconscious. Then, he stepped forward into the Daynight clan’s section of the space station.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrial’s eyes flickered. Lu Yin was indeed confident, and he had instantly taken action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had come to this place to check on Shenwu Continent’s situations, and he had made his preparations long ago. His next objective during this visit was to reveal his power. He knew that the more cautious he behaved, the more people would try to make trouble for him. He had to display the attitude of an Enlighter in order to cause those Enlighters who were secretly coveting Wendy Yushan to become apprehensive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Otherwise, there would only be unending troubles headed his way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An alarm rang, and many Daynight clan members appeared and surrounded Lu Yin and the other two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrial stepped forward to explain the situation, but Wendy Yushan had already unsheathed her sword. Sword qi swept through the room, and a Cruiser moved forward from the crowd of Daynight clan members to block the attack, but both of his arms were torn apart. Fresh blood stained the floor red, and the surrounding Daynight clan members suddenly didn’t dare to cause a ruckus.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan’s strength was enough for her to crush a normal Cruiser.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight immediately stepped forward. “Lu Yin, what do you guys want?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin glanced at the young man. “I want to see Tang Si.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight frowned. “Don’t cause trouble. Elder Qiuyu is about to arrive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s brows knitted; Nightqueen Qiuyu was coming? He glanced at Tyrial and saw the Hunter’s face turn to an unnatural state. Lu Yin immediately understood. He had forgotten that Tyrial was someone from the Darkmist Weave, and they were one of the predators that had originally coveted Shenwu Continent. He was not a good person. During the entire time they had been together talking, not once had Tyrial mentioned that Nightqueen Qiuyu was on her way. He probably wanted to see how Lu Yin would deal with an Enlighter!</span></p>
