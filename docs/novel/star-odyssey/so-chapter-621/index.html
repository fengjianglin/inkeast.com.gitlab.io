You’ve already made your family proud just by making it all the way here. Stay at the Budding Terrace for now, and perhaps you’ll be able to obtain a bit of fortune.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I think that there might be a bloodline in the northwest,” Autumnfrost Qing said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone looked at him in excitement. “Really? Brother Autumnfrost, what bloodline is it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked at him curiously.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A bloodline? How are they stored?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Autumnfrost Qing laughed. “This bloodline is very suitable for Fatty. It seems to be the Pompom Pig bloodline, which can be used to improve your bloodline.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people in the crowd were shocked and they all looked at Autumnfrost Qing in confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty’s face went pale as he stared at Autumnfrost Qing in a daze.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes narrowed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing everyone’s perplexed expressions, Autumnfrost Qing exclaimed, “Oh, I forgot! That fatty has always told people that his bloodline is that of the black cow. I’m sorry, Fatty, but if that bloodline over there really is the Pompom Pig bloodline, then this will truly be your lucky day. Don’t give up this chance to become stronger just for your pride. It’s to the northwest, so you can head over and take a look.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahahaha! Fatty, you actually have the Pompom Pig bloodline!” Sister Kui laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others taunted him as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Xiaojing was shocked, as she hadn’t known that the fatty had the Pompom Pig bloodline, and had always believed that he possessed the Black Cow bloodline. Although the two bloodlines were rather similar, they had very different reputations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty dropped his head, and his face was completely white. He clenched his fists tightly and wondered how Autumnfrost Qing could have discovered that he had the Pompom Pig bloodline! His reputation had been completely ruined now. Xiaojing would look down on him, not to mention that the entire Huang family had been disgraced. Autumnfrost Qing was truly a despicable person.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Autumnfrost Qing smirked; how dare this useless fatty contest him for Xiaojing! If the Huang family still had an Imprinter, then Autumnfrost Qing would likely be a bit more wary of them, but the Huang family’s power had dwindled over the years, and they had even been forced to use up their ancestor’s past contributions to obtain a futon. They would never return to their peak again, so it was fine to insult this fatty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Autumnfrost Qing glanced over at a crack in the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who’s that?” he shouted. He then immediately rushed over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A hidden silhouette’s pupils constricted as a person dashed out from inside the crack, scurrying away at an impressive speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Autumnfrost, that’s the guy who attacked us in First Divine Gate!” Yan Xiaojing immediately recognized the person.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Autumnfrost Qing slowed his chase, raised his right hand, and curled his fingers into claws. “Skyrender Claw.” The space around his right hand warped, and everyone present saw a massive claw appear in the sky that attacked the fleeing person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He screamed, “Please spare me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a bang as the claw slammed him into the ground, leaving a deep gouge filled with blood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was stunned, as that was an extremely powerful attack just now. The fleeing person had used both his imprint and bloodline at the last moment, but all of his defensive abilities had been destroyed by that claw. That attack was comparable to a full force attack from someone ranked fortieth on the Top 100 Rankings. Furthermore, Autumnfrost Qing had merely released a casual attack, which meant that he might be even more powerful than Nightking Gu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others moved forward and angrily looked down at the pool of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If not for him, Brother Lian and the rest wouldn’t have died,” Yan Xiaojing said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Autumnfrost Qing commented, “Then he got what was due.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty looked at the pool of blood in fear. Fortunately, he hadn’t impulsively said anything rude to Autumnfrost Qing. Otherwise, he might have ended up with the same fate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Xiaojing glanced at the fatty and motioned for him to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Autumnfrost Qing saw her movement and said, “Fatty, if you want to follow us, come back here in three days. I can take you to the Scripture Pavilion for Xiaojing’s sake, but that’s a dangerous place. You’ll have to depend on your own luck if you want to leave that place alive since I won’t be able to protect you the whole time.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Xiaojing quickly interjected, “Brother Autumnfrost, there’s no need for that. Just let him head back.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, I’ll be here!” Yan Xiaojing’s pleas had provoked the fatty, and so he immediately agreed. He even asked for a favor. “Can I bring this brother along with me?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, Autumnfrost Qing finally noticed Lu Yin. Lu Yin had been very casual up to now, and he was also within his own domain. Thus, Autumnfrost Qing was unable to sense Lu Yin’s power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who is this?” Autumnfrost Qing asked, as he suddenly remembered the domain expert that he had sensed earlier.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Xiaojing introduced Lu Yin to Autumnfrost Qing, “He’s a deaf and mute person that we met on our way here. He helped both Fatty and me along the way.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Autumnfrost, don’t bring him along. He didn’t use his imprint even when we were surrounded by Shenjia Guardians!

I’m thankful that you helped Xiaojing out before. However, you didn’t save my other friends, which cancels that out. You can follow us, but I won’t protect you.”&nbsp;</span></p>

He had been insulted just now, and so, he didn’t want to face Yan Xiaojing for the moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sometimes, loud and outspoken people like this fatty were the easiest ones to hurt.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bro, am I completely pathetic? My bloodline’s been exposed,” the fatty complained bitterly. “Our bloodline is supposed to be a symbol of strength in the Progenitor of Bloodlines Territory. A good bloodline can even transform a person. Autumnfrost Qing publicly insulted me, and everyone—even Xiaojing—knows what his character is like. He’s petty, paranoid, and arrogant, but due to his family and bloodline, nobody cares about his character.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Autumnfrost family is one of the few World Imprinter families in the Progenitor of Bloodlines Territory, and Elder Autumnfrost is their World Imprinter. Autumnfrost Qing is the direct heir to the Autumnfrost family, and he even possesses the Sky Overlord bloodline. Once that bloodline advances, it can become an invincible bloodline. It’s only slightly inferior to Teffa’s Ghost Racoon bloodline, and so, most people want to suck up to him.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty looked at his hands. “Meanwhile, I have the Pompom Pig bloodline. What a joke…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin quietly listened to his companion’s rant, but he didn’t have any time to console fatty since he was using his domain to observe the Budding Terrace. This platform was absolutely enormous, and he couldn’t even see the entire thing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty finally stopped whining after a few hours, but Lu Yin had already sealed off his ears an hour into the rant. This stupid fatty nagged so often and complained about his life so much that even Lu Yin had started feeling slightly depressed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ghost Monkey had immediately asked Lu Yin to screen him off, as he’d rather be screened off than be forced to listen to the fatty’s complaints.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty suddenly sighed. “I feel much better now. Bro, you’re the best! I’ve finally finished venting all my frustrations.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Lu Yin couldn’t hear him as he was instead looking at their surroundings. There weren’t any lucky opportunities nearby, only some people who occasionally walked past them from time to time. In particular, a certain fellow who they had just seen left after being shocked by something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hang on, that’s not right. There are more and more people headed towards that direction</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">. Lu Yin turned to look into the distance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moments later, a group of five or six people walked past the two while curiously glancing at Lu Yin and the fatty. They then continued on in another direction.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those people are from the Second Supreme Gate. The Daosource Sect has four main mountain gates: First Divine Gate, Second Supreme Gate, Third Azure Gate, and Fourth Imperial Gate. The Second Supreme Gate is near the First Divine Gate, but the Third Azure Gate and Fourth Imperial Gate are further away. Despite the Second Supreme Gate being closer, it still takes a few days to get to the Second Supreme Gate from First Divine Gate. It seems like this group of people plans to stay on the Budding Terrace, but that’s a pretty common occurrence,” the fatty explained.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin hadn’t known that there were three other gates in addition to the First Divine Gate, but with this information, he was able to guess that each gate had its own trials.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are many fortunes on the Budding Terrace, and many people stay in this area to search for opportunities. Some of them have actually managed to find their destiny, and I wonder if Fat Bro will be lucky enough to find anything.” The fatty had finally recovered and was again calling himself Fat Bro.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One day passed, but the fatty and Lu Yin didn’t find anything. The fatty kept cursing Autumnfrost Qing the whole time as there was clearly nothing in the northwestern region. Clearly, Autumnfrost Qing had used that moment to expose the fatty’s Pompom Pig bloodline and insult him. Although the fatty had already known that there wouldn’t be any bloodlines in this area, he still had to go and take a look. If he really could advance his bloodline, then his power would absolutely rise.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had been using his domain the entire time, but he hadn’t seen more than ten people over the course of the entire day. The people who he had seen were about as strong as Yan Xiaojing, and none of them could compare to Autumnfrost Qing. He was truly an elite powerhouse of his generation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t possible to have a large group of powerful people who were comparable to the top fifteen of the Top 100 Rankings. That list encompassed the youths from the seventy two weaves of the outerverse, the eight major flowzones of the Innerverse, the Starfall Sea, the Cosmic Sea, and many more areas of the Human Domain. One had to be extremely talented to step onto the Top 100 Rankings. For example, Northgate Lie was the only person who had managed to do so from all of Northline Flowzone. Despite his accomplishment, he was still ranked at the very bottom of the list. Although this was a weird place, it was impossible for there to be many equally powerful people here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, what Lu Yin wanted to find out about the most was the time limit of his futon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey Bro, that person should be from the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Progenitor of Combat Territory too!” the fatty exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked over and saw a young man slowly walk past them. He glanced at Lu Yin and the fatty, smiled, and then leisurely continued on his way.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had already noticed this person long ago. He had retracted his domain because this person had discovered him as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was wary of this person, and compared to Autumnfrost Qing, Lu Yin was definitely more wary of this unknown person since he had disregarded Lu Yin even though he knew that the domain that he had sensed belonged to Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You people from the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Progenitor of Combat Territory have a completely different vibe compared to the people from our&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Progenitor of Bloodlines Territory</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">. I could instantly tell that he’s from the Progenitor of Combat Territory. Brother, you have the same vibe as well, but yours isn’t as good as that guy’s,” the fatty commented.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another day passed by, and the fatty had finally given up on finding a lucky chance. Thus, the two of them went back to where they separated from the group.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although the Scripture Pavilion is dangerous, since that stupid Autumnfrost Qing will be with us, we probably won’t run into too much danger. He won’t dare to hurt us since that would damage his own reputation, and at worst, he’ll just insult us. So, Bro, we should keep following him. Actually, it would be perfect if we actually managed to find a destiny,” the fatty said hopefully.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin wasn’t planning on finding any fortunes since he had realized that the Daosource Sect had already existed for countless years. After the passage of so much time, all of the desirable destinies must have already been discovered and seized by other people. Thus, he definitely wouldn’t be able to find any. This was especially true since he had been traveling with the unlucky fatty; even if there were any lucky opportunities in their path, this guy had probably chased them all away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If not for the fact that he couldn’t find anyone better to get information out of, Lu Yin also would have abandoned the fatty.&nbsp;</span></p>
