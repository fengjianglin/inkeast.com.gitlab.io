 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A series of soft beeps sounded out from Lu Yin’s gadget.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked down and his gaze changed; this was incredible.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How did this happen?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Ten Arbiters have ruled that Lu Yin has no blemishes on his record and that he is allowed to join the Council of Astral Academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being able to join the Council of Astral Academy was hugely significant to Lu Yin. First, this meant that he was no longer just an ordinary student; rather, he had become a subsidiary member of the Ten Arbiters Council. This status gave him the Ten Arbiters’ protection, and there was no better backer than the Ten Arbiters. Even the Lockbreaker Society’s backing could not compare to the Ten Arbiters Council’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Lu Yin was slightly puzzled. Nightqueen Yanqing and Nightking Zhenwu had clearly made their moves. He was one of the Ten Arbiters, so how could Lu Yin still be able to join the Council of Astral Academy? At this moment, Lu Yin was feeling less elated and more apprehensive, as something unexpected had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, someone called him through his gadget, and Lu Yin answered. A cold and arrogant voice came through, and Lu Yin’s expression sank when he recognized it as Nightqueen Yanqing’s. “Congratulations on entering the Council of Astral Academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You must be very baffled at how you were able to enter.” Nightqueen Yanqing’s tone was a little lofty and indignant. “You’re pretty good. You even colluded with a Daynight girl and got her to step up and testify for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s heart skipped a beat and a name suddenly appeared in his mind—Zhuo Daynight. Aside from her, there was nobody else who could testify for him. He had gone to the pirate port back then in order to save her, so she was naturally the only person who could testify and clear his name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he was at the Tilting Tower, Lu Yin had already considered requesting Zhuo Daynight’s help, but he had ultimately decided against it. First of all, she might not even appear since she was also a member of the Daynight clan. Secondly, he did not want to owe Zhuo Daynight any favors, as he already had made her a promise. He wasn’t sure how he could pay her back if he owed her any more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He never expected Zhuo Daynight to spontaneously testify on his behalf and allow him to successfully join the Council of Astral Academy. What was she thinking?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s your relationship with that woman?” Nightqueen Yanqing barked interrogatively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cold glint flashed through Lu Yin’s eyes as he responded, “It’s none of your business.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that so? Anyways, I’ll have to admit that you have your ways. But so what? That girl has betrayed my brother and been imprisoned in the Daynight clan. Here, take a look for yourself.” A video file was then sent to Lu Yin’s gadget.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin apprehensively tapped on the video, and it was indeed Zhuo Daynight, whom he had not seen for a few months. In the video, she was wearing a prisoner’s outfit, and her face had a deathly pallor to it. She seemed to have fainted within the dark prison holding her. Old bloodstains could also be seen on her clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s gaze grew heated, and a flare of anger erupted from within him like never before. This fury was ten or even a hundred stronger than the humiliation he had felt after suffering under Bazeer. He was overcome by a wild impulse to destroy the entire Daynight clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With this surge of rage, his star energy turned unstable and even the void surrounding him warped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, the Trialmaster lifted his gaze and spoke. “Be quiet.” The deep sound that was reminiscent of a drumbeat shocked Lu Yin back to his senses. He breathed in deeply and suppressed his star energy. “What do you want?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, his voice was so calm that it was terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other end of the connection, Nightqueen Yanqing involuntarily felt a chill creep into the bottom of her heart, but she paid it no attention. “I’ve already given you a chance, but you’re not discerning enough to accept it. It seems that you really think that you can resist my Daynight clan by yourself. It doesn’t matter if you are the strongest person in the entire Astral Combat Academy; my Daynight clan can still easily wipe you out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is she still alive?” Lu Yin’s tone was icy, and his eyes hid an even deeper chill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing was pleased by his question. “Of course, I’ll keep her alive properly. She has colluded with outsiders and betrayed my brother; her crimes deserve decades of torture.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin inhaled deeply. “I’ll give up on joining the Council of Astral Academy. Do not torture her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing snorted disdainfully. “Lu Yin, you think too much of yourself. Do you really think that my Daynight clan cares about you? To my brother, dealing with you is as easy as lifting a finger. In fact, he’s already forgotten you. However, this woman has gone against my brother’s wishes too many times, and this incident was just the straw that broke the camel’s back. You’re still not at the level where my Daynight clan would worry about you. As for the Council of Astral Academy, you can join if you wish. It doesn’t matter. It’s all just a game to my brother.” She immediately ended the call after saying her last word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stood where he was, motionless for a long while. The image of Zhuo Daynight being imprisoned in a dark cell filled his mind, as well as her bloodstained clothes. It was too disturbing and so… heavy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did not even know where his emotions were coming from, as he had only met Zhuo Daynight three times. The first was a brief encounter while the second had been hostile. It was their third meeting that had left a deep impression on him—her helplessness, desolation, and nearly silent whispers. He remembered it all deeply. The two of them had not interacted much, but Zhuo Daynight’s suffering was all due to Lu Yin. This responsibility was too heavy to bear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was possible that Zhuo Daynight had only testified to repay Lu Yin for the favor of saving her life. Even still, Lu Yin felt an invisible burden weigh upon his shoulders, and he hoped that he could rescue that girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Trialmaster sighed. “The Daynight clan. Once again, it’s the Daynight clan.” He looked at Lu Yin with a complicated expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was shocked and hurried towards the mentor. “Trialmaster, do you have any ideas of how I could save my friend?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mentor looked at Lu Yin through his old, murky eyes and there was an unprecedented seriousness in his bearing. “Little brat, tell me. What’s your relationship with that girl?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was stumped. Relationship? He actually did not know what he considered her. A friend perhaps? Probably not, but was she an enemy? That was also not the case. After a moment of consideration, he replied, “We can be considered to be reluctant friends.”</span></p>

It’s a law that’s been passed down since ancient times. Brat, you should know that, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin muttered, “Trialmaster, she’s just my friend, but I do want to save her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mentor sighed again. “Save her? You’ll need a core elder of the Daynight clan to personally intervene. I know a Daynight elder, but what can you offer to request their help?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin clenched his fists and wondered what he could use to enlist the help of an elder of the Daynight clan. That person was an elder of one of the strongest clans in the universe. This was someone who Lu Yin was not even qualified to converse with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Lu Yin thought of something and his heart quickened. He looked at the mentor. “Trialmaster, could you please contact the Daynight elder? I do indeed have something that I can exchange.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Trialmaster sneered as he replied, “Little brat, the Daynight elders are all great beings who are at least at the Hunter realm. They’ve seen all sorts of treasure, so don’t attract their ridicule.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin seriously said, “Trialmaster, rest assured. I’m quite confident that this will move the elder to help.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mentor nodded. “Very well, I’ll contact him.” He then retrieved a rather ancient-looking gadget from under his buttocks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin withdrew a certain distance from the Trialmaster and stopped blocking the star energy to his right arm. “Don’t talk nonsense or else I’ll block you again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re being too much. We are one body! How could you do this to me?” The Ghost Monkey was furious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had an ice-cold gaze on his face. “I have no time to deal with your nonsense. Tell me, is that beast hide really related to Progenitor Wushang?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course! That’s something that I went to great trouble to obtain. Why else do you think Yao Gu triggered the decisive battle at the border and repeatedly targeted Planet Conan? All of that was just to obtain this one thing. Why are you suddenly asking me about this?” The Ghost Monkey was suspicious of Lu Yin’s motives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I need to use this thing to trade for a person right now. If what you say is false, then I will instantly obliterate you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ghost Monkey was momentarily stunned, but he quickly recovered and shouted, “What did you just say? Exchange it? You’re crazy! Do you know what that thing is? That’s Progenitor Wushang’s hide! Pro. Gen. I. Tor. Wu. Shang. It’s Progenitor Wushang’s... You don’t even understand what Progenitor Wushang’s name means. Exchange? Only you would think of something that harebrained. Even if you sell your entire Astral Combat Academy, it wouldn’t be worth a single hair from that hide.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s mood was heavy. “I don’t have any choice. This is all I have.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ghost Monkey was desperate to change Lu Yin’s mind, “What are you trying to exchange for the hide for? An art? A battle technique? A treasure map? Just say what you need, and I can help you get it! I know where many powerhouses’ graves are. I can be of great help with robbing tombs!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin shook his head. Since that beast hide really did seem to be related to Progenitor Wushang based on the Ghost Monkey’s reaction, it was definitely priceless. To the Daynight clan, it greatly surpassed Zhuo Daynight in terms of value, but to Lu Yin, measuring value was not as straightforward. Zhuo Daynight was suffering because of him, and so he would do all he could to rescue her. He would even not hesitate to exchange the larger beast hide for her freedom. This was just him following his personal code of conduct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A screen appeared in front of the Trialmaster that showed a desolate ground contrasting against a grey sky. An old man with a downcast expression appeared, his black-and-white long hair falling to his waist. He looked aged, but his skin also seemed to have a roaming brilliance. “Old Tan, how are you? You’re not dead yet?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Trialmaster duly replied, “How could I die before you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder sneered. “I’m much younger than you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mentor walked in front of Lu Yin. “I don’t have much time to talk trash with you. This fellow’s the one who wants to talk to you this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder appeared astonished when he looked at Lu Yin, who could feel the old man’s powerful aura even through the screen. If felt as if it could suppress everything in the endless void. He took a deep breath and bowed at the waist. “Student Lu Yin pays his respects to Senior.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder sized Lu Yin up and down before turning to the Trialmaster. “So this is your grandchild? Do you have that ability as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Trialmaster ignored the Daynight elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin respectfully continued, saying, “This junior is Astral-10’s student, and I shamelessly requested for Mentor to contact Senior so that I might request your help.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder seemed like he could not be bothered. “My help? Little brat, do you know who I am?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A Daynight elder.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder arrogantly replied, “I am Nightking Yuanjing, a Nightking elder! Not just some elder from the Daynight clan. Little brat, don’t be mistaken about my status.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin bowed again. “It’s my mistake to have to trouble Senior.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, I don’t have the time to waste chatting with you. Since you dared to contact me, then you must be confident in being able to enlist my help. Speak, and if I’m satisfied, I’ll naturally help you.” Nightking Yuanjing had little patience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin opened his mouth to speak, but the Ghost Monkey’s voice suddenly rang out in his mind. “Hold on, you’re trying to make an exchange with the Nightking clan? Why didn’t you tell me this earlier? I’ll give you some information that they’ll exchange anything for.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hurry up. I have no time to waste talking to you,” Nightking Yuanjing said with a frown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Trialmaster also looked at Lu Yin, as he was very curious what Lu Yin would use to plead with a Nightking elder. There were just too few things in this universe that could actually move this old thing’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin trembled as he asked, “I don’t know if Elder wishes to know the whereabouts of the Third Nightking.”</span></p>
