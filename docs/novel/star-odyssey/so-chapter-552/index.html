Unfortunately, this junior’s afraid of dying, so I can’t really trust you.” Lu Yin then tapped out and a gust of wind struck the second chest, opening it as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Wu and <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> stared at the chest with bulging eyes. As soon as another formless danger burst forth, they would have to suffer heavy injuries in order to retreat.&nbsp;</span></p>

There wasn’t a sourcebox inside. Instead, a piece of Progenitor Wushang’s hide had been stuck inside the box, and when the two Enlighters saw it, they felt their minds be jostled. Lu Yin took this opportunity to aim and fire his gun, first at Elder Wu, and then again at <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

Lu Yin’s shot had missed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s pupils constricted as he stared at the dissipating mist in shock. What had just happened? He had clearly aimed at <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span>’s head, but his head turned into a dark mist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dark mist that had taken the place of <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> dissipated. Then, Lu Yin clearly saw <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span>’s true appearance and was stunned. <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> was only a meter tall!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> came to his senses, as his head had cleared by the second gunshot. He saw the black mist fading away above his head, and he stared at Lu Yin in fear. “Junior, I nearly died at your hands!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin couldn’t believe his eyes. “Is this your real body?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> suddenly leaped up. The formless danger from the sourcebox caused multiple wounds to appear on his arm and legs. But before he was able to completely avoid the sourcebox’s invisible danger, his body was struck, and he crashed heavily to the ground. He spat out a mouthful of blood and looked at the sourcebox within the chest in fear. He then looked back at Lu Yin with an icy glare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin gripped his gun tightly and pointed it at <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span>. This old fart was too devious. He was clearly only one meter tall, but he had pretended to be two meters tall and managed to avoid Lu Yin’s killing shot. It was troubling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> raised a hand. “Junior, I don’t want to become enemies with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes narrowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> spat out a mouthful of blood. “There are so many Enlighters from the Innerverse who are stuck in the Outerverse, and those people are the ones who are our true enemy. Junior, I’ll look forward to cooperating with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> then leaped up and tore through the void to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stared closely at the void, and he only lowered his gun after he could verify that the rune lines had disappeared. His palms were sweaty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Enlighters were vigilant, it was too difficult to kill them. This wily old fox had plotted specially to ambush Elder Wu, and he had even played Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, won’t that old fart spread information about you?” The Ghost Monkey was worried.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was also worried, as it would be hard to continually use these methods to kill another Enlighter if they were revealed to the universe. During this ambush, both his gun and Progenitor Wushang’s hide had been exposed. “Just ignore him. So what if he releases it. There’s no way that he could have recognized Progenitor Wushang's hide, so all he knows is that I have a means to daze Enlighters, and that’s enough. Otherwise, he would not have left.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s true. There are only a few people in this universe who can recognize Progenitor Wushang's hide. Even that Sea King might not be able to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Wu was dead. Lu Yin had removed the threat of Darkstar Gorge that had been hanging over his head. Now, there was only the Scholar Newmoon left. Lu Yin looked up. He hoped that the Scholar Newmoon had not made his move to capture Wendy yet. He had to rush over to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It took him half a day of work to shut the chest and encase the sourcebox once again. After that, he grabbed the piece of Progenitor Wushang's hide and walked over to Elder Wu’s corpse. This was the third Enlighter that he had killed. &nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, where did that gun of yours come from? That thing can even kill an Enlighter,” the monkey asked in an odd tone. He had been wondering about this for a long time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s something that I got during lockbreaking. It’s some kind of an ancient item,” Lu Yin answered simply as he squatted down to retrieve Elder Wu’s cosmic ring, as well as the dead man’s blood. He then collected all of the polarium essence that was left on the ground and he moved to leave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Obtained through lockbreaking? An ancient item? That can’t be. I am very knowledgeable in the field of archaeology. One look is enough to tell that that gun is not ancient.” The monkey voiced his doubts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s up to you whether or not you want to believe me.” Lu Yin’s reply was straightforward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monkey was helpless, as he had already promised numerous times that he would not betray Lu Yin, and yet, no matter what, Lu Yin did not trust him. The monkey couldn’t even be bothered to kick up a fuss about it any more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">News of Elder Wu’s death would not spread quickly. Even if Elder Wu went missing, no one would think that he had died. For now, Lu Yin needed to get in touch with Wendy Yushan and find out what the situation at San Dios was looking like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, he felt a powerful pressure coming from off in the distance. Lu Yin looked up as his eyes filled with star energy, staring into the distance, where he saw an enormous number of rune lines. Although they could not compare with an Enlighter, they were not too far from it. These rune lines were from a peak Hunter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This pressure came from the region that was under Darkstar Gorge’s control. Another expert from that power had arrived on the planet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin hurriedly concealed his star energy and then used only his physical strength to run across the ground towards his hidden spacecraft.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very soon after, the void where Lu Yin had just been was torn open, and a man with a sullen face walked out. Strangely, his eyes were tightly shut.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He sensed the air for a moment and then headed in the direction that Lu Yin had escaped.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a trivial task for the Hunter to catch up to Lu Yin in terms of speed, but Lu Yin had concealed his star energy while the man had not comprehended a domain. Thus, he was not able to sense Lu Yin even when he used his star energy to search the space in front of him. Also, Lu Yin’s domain enabled him to merge with his surroundings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Underground, beneath a giant worm’s corpse, Lu Yin looked upwards through the crevices in the ground. He saw the Hunter from Darkstar Gorge appear, only to vanish shortly after. Lu Yin had an ugly expression on his face, as this person was moving about with his eyes tightly closed. Evidently, this person knew about Progenitor Wushang's hide. It had to be <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span>. Aside from that old Enlighter, there was no one else who knew that Lu Yin could use the hide to stun powerhouses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That devious sly old fox</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">, Lu Yin mentally cursed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other party had clearly made their own preparations, and they had even sent a peak Hunter. Lu Yin’s gun was powerful, but that did not mean that his attack would definitely connect. If he wasn’t able to stun this Hunter, then it would be pointless to shoot at him. Even if the universal armor could block the Hunter’s attacks, that didn’t mean that <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span> wouldn’t suddenly return and ambush him. That old fogey was very crafty, and Lu Yin didn’t have enough confidence in the armor to face him at this time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He needed to first find a better means of escaping from this planet. And afterwards, he could think about his revenge.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin found some time to transmit an image of Elder Wu’s death to Wendy Yushan, and then he headed towards his hidden spacecraft while traveling underground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was not easy to avoid pursuit and make it to his spacecraft. He could have gotten there quickly if he had flown, but he had to rely only on his physical strength to forcefully travel through the soil. It was difficult to cover such a distance, and it would take Lu Yin at least a couple of days.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Several days later, atop the tower at East San Dios, Puyu was looking down. The meeting had lasted for a few days, and what had needed to be said had already been said. There was only one matter remaining, which was to force Wendy Yushan to hand her secret technique over and then draw out Lu Yin. As long as they were able to kill Lu Yin and get their hands on the secret technique, Darkstar Gorge’s power would soar, and they would be guaranteed a strong ally in the Scholar Newmoon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re still not going to act? She’s about to leave.” Liu Shaoge stepped up onto the tower and sat down casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Puyu kept his back to the new arrival. “Do you think that I will be the one to act?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoge’s brows rose. “There’s someone else?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Puyu’s lips curled up. “They’ll arrive shortly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Darkstar Gorge wasn’t the only power that had made arrangements to deal with Lu Yin, as Scholar Newmoon was determined to do so as well. Although Elder Wu had gone to Shuta Planet, Scholar Newmoon had followed the original plan and traveled to East San Dios. He greatly desired the secret technique, and he also felt a need to kill Lu Yin. Elder Wu had been aware that the Scholar Newmoon would act, so he had been at ease when he headed to Shuta Planet. However, Puyu wasn’t certain what methods Elder Wu had used to guarantee that Scholar Newmoon would share the secret technique after obtaining it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan was staying in a courtyard. After receiving the picture confirming Elder Wu’s death, she knew that it was time to leave. She had come to San Dios this time for two reasons. First of all, she was trying to act responsibly. The second reason was to resolve their current crisis. She and Lu Yin could not allow this conflict to reach the Frostwave Weave, and now that Elder Wu had died, it was time for her to return home.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the Outerverse Youth Council, it was unavoidable that it’s power would decline. With Enlighters running about the Outerverse and the council cut off from the support of the Ten Arbiters, it was inevitable that the power dynamic of the entire Outerverse would change. Unless the council was supported by more than just one Enlighter, it’s power would gradually fade away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Wendy Yushan had never bothered with the council’s internal matters, it had shown her a kindness that she would not forget. In the future, once she became unrivalled in the Outerverse with her secret technique, she would once again rebuild the Outerverse Youth Council out of gratitude towards the Ten Arbiters Council.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the secret technique, Wendy no longer doubted her strength in the future unless, of course, she died prematurely.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She left the courtyard and observed her surroundings. Despite the fact that the council was already on the path to decline, no one would dare to touch them in this place. A declining power was one thing, but no one could know for certain that the Innerverse and the Outerverse would remain separated forever. There would come a day when the two regions would reconnect, and at that time, whoever acted against Wendy Yushan would have to face the punishment of the Ten Arbiters. No one was willing to take such a risk.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Closeby, there was a bang as a woman fell down. She held her forehead as she stood up. “Pain, pain…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan glanced over. “Zhao Ran, do you remember Lu Yin?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Ran stood up with a dazed expression. “Lu Yin?”</span></p>

She opened a piece of paper that was hanging from her neck and looked at it. “I remember now! Lu Yin, he brought me here. He’s a good person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan looked at the girl. “Do you want to leave this place with me? I’ll take you to see him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Ran thought about it, but then she shook her head and answered in a downcast voice, “There’s no need. I lose my memory often, so I’m a burden. I don’t want to be a burden to him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan wanted to reply, but a kind-looking elder in white robes slowly walked over in front of her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan’s gaze trembled when she saw the man, and she pushed Zhao Ran behind her while vigilantly watching the elder. “The Ross Empire’s Scholar Newmoon.”</span></p>
