Chaos Flowzone was adjacent to the Starfall Sea, and so the people from there were well aware of the Starfall Sea’s might. The ban on battling on the seaweed was a rule set in place by the Starfall Sea’s ruler, the Sea King, and no one dared to violate it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they saw that Feng Mo did not continue attacking them, the group relaxed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He doesn’t dare to attack. If he does, the Sea King will teach him the meaning of regret,” Hui Daynight said in a deep voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin relaxed, but then, the pain in his abdomen overcame him once again. He looked down and saw that the aftershock from the earlier impact had actually torn his skin open, and there was a bloody wound on his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah, Brother Lu, you’re injured! Coco will give you a jab,” Coco quickly offered as she whipped out her giant syringe. Her face had a very worried expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin immediately turned her down. “I have some medicine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He hurriedly retrieved some of Shamrock Enterprises’ special medicine and consumed them, leaving Coco disappointed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stood up with Coco’s support. They then walked out of the spacecraft and stepped down onto the giant seaweed, discovering that it was very soft.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they exited the vessel, there were many bystanders staring at them in amazement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This strand of seaweed was beyond enormous, and it was not that much different from a city, as countless buildings had been constructed atop the giant plant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, a man wearing an azure ring armor descended. His bearing was proud, and he directly approached Lu Yin’s group. “You’ve damaged the seaweed. Either pay restitution or accept the appropriate punishment for fighting on the seaweed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lulu casually tossed out a Mavis Bank card. “Swipe it as you wish.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a dominating behavior stunned even the armored man for a bit, but then he tossed the card back to Lulu. “No swiping.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How much is the fine?” Xia Luo asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seaweed maintenance costs five star essence.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youths were shocked. “Why is this thing so expensive? That’s 500,000 star crystals!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man remained arrogant. “This was raised by the Sea King's Dome, and it can be found nowhere else in the universe, only here, outside of the Starfall Sea.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rarity of the object determined its value.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lulu’s lips twitched, but she still casually tossed the man five star essence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man put the money away, ignoring them as he quickly left. From start to finish, he had behaved arrogantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That bastard’s looking down on us,” Meng Yue was irritated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hui Daynight felt nervous. “He’s qualified to since he’s from the Sea King's Dome.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Sea King's Dome?” Meng Yue was puzzled. Like Lu Yin, he was someone from the Outerverse, so he was not very familiar with the Starfall Sea. The average person would not be able to access any information related to the Sea King's Dome on the network.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Sea King's Dome is the seat of the Starfall Sea’s ruler, and it governs the entire Starfall Sea. The master of the Sea King's Dome is the Sea King, and his word is like the heavenly law within the Starfall Sea, to the extent where no one dares to disobey him even outside of the Starfall Sea. It’s rumored that the Sea King’s power level is over 500,000,” Xia Luo explained.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group was immediately horrified; the strongest among them were Big Pao and Little Pao, who had just broken through, becoming Explorers with power levels of just over 10,000. What did “over 500,000” mean?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s heart skipped; 500,000 was the threshold of an Envoy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, we need to move the spacecraft to another docking location and then get someone to give it a coating before we can enter the Starfall Sea. We are only allowed to stay on the seaweed for three days maximum, which means that, after this time, we need to either enter the Starfall Sea or leave,” Michelle informed the others since she had some understanding of the Starfall Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, Hui Daynight, Meng Yue, and Zhao Yilong went to take care of the vessel while Coco helped Lu Yin to a building that looked like a bar along with the others. Upon entering, it seemed that this building was a place for newcomers to gather information.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Coco did not forget to offer Lu Yin an injection, but Lu Yin had only been superficially wounded. His injuries were relatively minor, so he would not agree to her offer no matter what, leaving Coco very disappointed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo stared at them from a distance, his gaze a perpetual thorn in their backs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were many people on the seaweed, and the bar had been established by some permanent residents. Becoming a permanent resident on the seaweed involved an arduous application process. However, once one successfully passed through the process, they would be able to discard any worries about any previous enemies they might have had since they would have the protection of the Sea King from then on. No one dared to act violently on the seaweed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Starfall Sea’s entrance could be said to be one of the more blessed places in the Innerverse, because it was one of the few places where people did not need to worry about the law of the jungle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin and the rest sat down in three groups at the bar. The lights inside the building were kept dim, and there was no clamorous music. Everyone in the building tried to stay quiet, which was not quite the same atmosphere the group expected from a bar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After they sat down, Lulu impatiently asked, “Lu Yin, where did you get Fatesand?!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Michelle, Coco and Zora did not understand the question since they had never even heard of Fatesand before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, Seventh Bro, where did you get that Fatesand?” The monkey was also curious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin swirled his wine around in his glass. “Someone gave it to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lulu exclaimed, “Who’s so generous that they would give you Fatesand? That’s Fatesand! A precious treasure of the universe!.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sister Lulu, what’s Fatesand?” Coco asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Luo spoke up to explain. “It’s a sort of treasure that can fuse with one’s body. It can also awaken into a form that’s the most suitable for the individual. It’s very mysterious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fatesand might as well not even exist in the Outerverse, and there’s very little of it even in the Innerverse. It’s a coin toss as to whether even the Ten Arbiters have some,” Lulu said gravely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others were shocked, as this was something that not even the Ten Arbiters might have. This showed how rare and precious it was. Where had Lu Yin gotten some?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Michelle stared closely at Lu Yin, as she knew a bit more than the others and was aware that Lu Yin had possibly been colluding with pirates. Although it was true that the Blackbeard Pirates had been lured out one way or another this time, that did not completely eliminate Lu Yin’s possible connection to pirates. The Outerverse’s Darkstar Gorge had actually been split open by one slice from a super powerhouse’s attack. Michelle had heard about the matter from her sister, and she knew that Lu Yin’s background was not as simple as it appeared to be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin rolled his eyes. “Don’t try to exaggerate things. How could the Ten Arbiters not have it? Even if they really don’t, it would only be because they don’t want to use it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lulu retorted, “It’s no exaggeration! Even my Mavis Family only has a few grains of Fatesand, and we’ve never stopped searching for more throughout the years. Despite that, we’ve only managed to get a hold of those few grains. Do you really think that what I just said is exaggerated?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s heart leaped; it seemed that this thing was even more valuable than he had originally been led on to believe. It was no wonder why the monkey had not believed him in the slightest when he had told the beast that he had Fatesand. It also started to make sense why not even his two Honor Points were enough for him to grant him access to any information on Fatesand through the network.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, I already told you that Tian Hou is the strongest person in the Spiritual Academy, as well as Skymender’s disciple, but even he doesn’t have any Fatesand. You should realize how precious it is! I only learned of it from a powerhouse’s records. I can tell you this—not even that Hunter who attacked you recognized that thing as Fatesand. Speaking of which, it’s not really a surprise that the Mavis girl can identify it, but why does that Xia Luo know about it as well?” the monkey said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s thoughts were the complete opposite of the Ghost Monkey’s, as he was certain that Xia Luo knew way more than Lu Yin did himself. This person had concealed himself rather deeply, but fortunately, he held no hostility towards Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And Lu Yin had also noticed an important detail right before he had repulsed the Hunter’s attack: both Lulu’s and Xia Luo’s bodies had converged with an exceptional number of rune lines, and this abnormality only had one explanation. They had been prepared to defend against the Hunter’s blow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin could still believe it if Lulu used the Mavis family’s innate gift to withstand the Hunter’s strike, but what about Xia Luo? Lu Yin was rather interested in his comrade’s secret, especially since they both had primeval surnames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Lu, your Fatesand’s awakened form is rather unique. Congratulations.” Xia Luo suddenly smiled as he looked at Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, Lulu blinked and recalled that clump of dirt. Then, she laughed impudently and in an extremely taunting manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin felt helpless. It was indeed true that his Fatesand’s awakened form truly was just a clump of dirt. Real, authentic dirt. There were no marks or anything on it at all, which caused him to be rather speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, stop laughing. At least it has a strong defense,” Lu Yin said with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Luo had a serious look. “Brother Lu, I didn’t mean to ridicule you. Fatesand may be a precious treasure, but it still isn’t enough to make up for the disparity between a Limiteer and a Hunter. Moreover, he’s a Hunter with a power level of over 150,000. Your Fatesand’s awakened form was able to block Feng Mo’s strike, which is unprecedented. Perhaps what we saw isn’t accurate, and we just weren’t able to fully comprehend it.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin thought about it and ultimately agreed. If everybody with awakened Fatesand were able to withstand a Hunter’s attack, then common knowledge would be completely ripped apart, so it should be impossible. So, why was his Fatesand able to do so?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Feng Mo’s casual strike could be thought of as an attack with a lower power level, and its force might not have surpassed 70,000, it still carried the might of a Hunter with it. It did not make sense for Lu Yin to have charged forth without thinking, and even he himself was in disbelief at his former actions, and even more so at the fact that he had been able to withstand the attack. Thinking back on it, the reason why he had charged out so boldly had been because Feng Mo’s strike had not consisted of an excessive amount of rune lines, so Lu Yin had assumed that he could block it. However, could that have partly been due to the Fatesand affecting him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin thought about it some more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He urgently wanted to speak with some other people who had fused with Fatesand and see if it was possible that it had influenced his subconscious. Or perhaps there had been some other ability that had shielded him from the pressure of a powerhouse’s might. Otherwise, he could not explain why he had hot-headedly charged out, as he had not been able to feel that pressure at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, it’s time to think about what’s next. Feng Mo will not let us go, so he will definitely chase us into the Starfall Sea, and killing is not prohibited there. On the contrary, murders happen in there all the time, and we’ll never be able to escape from him,” Michelle said gravely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked up. “There’s a simple method. Feng Mo’s target is me, Big Pao, and Little Pao. The three of us can each head out on our own, and he’ll only be able to chase after one of us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’ll probably chase after you,” Michelle said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin fell silent, since that was very likely to be the case. Feng Mo had to capture Lu Yin alive, as his main objective was to hand Lu Yin over to the Blackbeard Pirates. The Bo Duo was not foolish, either, and it was very likely that they had also investigated the matter of the Blackbeard Pirates being plundered. Of course, they could not be completely certain, which was why they had paid such a high price for Feng Mo to capture Lu Yin alive. The most important target was definitely Lu Yin himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gloomy gaze from the Hunter could still be felt. Feng Mo had not even bothered to conceal himself, and he had sat down in the same bar, about ten meters away from Lu Yin’s group. He was entirely focused on Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin felt a headache coming on; if he had known what would happen, he would have changed his appearance when he had arrived at Deep Crimson Planet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His back went cold from Feng Mo’s constant staring. He called the bartender over, pointed at Feng Mo, and said, “Give that brother a drink as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo sneered, “You can’t escape. Just follow me obediently, and I can still spare your life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin smiled amicably, but he felt a headache creep up on him again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wondered if there were any experts from the Lockbreaker Society or the Ten Arbiters Council on the seaweed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he was left with no other choice, then Lu Yin could still reveal his relationship with Highsage Leon. Given the intimidation from the Pirate King, the Relentless Slayers definitely would not dare to touch Lu Yin. After all, Highsage Leon was not the Daynight clan—he was the Pirate King. Such a person would have plenty of methods. But that was his last option.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He downed a mouthful of wine. At that moment, Big Pao ran over and sat down besides Lu Yin. He excitedly whispered, “I’ve come up with a way where Feng Mo definitely will not dare to attack us, even if his courage is multiplied by ten!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd felt strange upon hearing Big Pao’s words. “How?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Pao’s lips curled up. “Have you heard of the Sea King’s search for a son-in-law?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Sea King’s looking for a son-in-law?” Lu Yin and the rest were at a loss, as they had not heard about this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Pao, Meng Yue, and the rest also moved over to listen.</span></p>
