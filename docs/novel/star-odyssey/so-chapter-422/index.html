So, logically, you should have been one of the strongest of the Astral Beast Domain’s younger generation. However, you still couldn’t get a hold of any Fatesand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, you’ve also defeated Tian Hou, who’s the strongest at the Spiritual Academy, but that won’t get you any Fatesand. Not just anyone can take out something like that, and even the grand prize for the Astral Combat Tournament wouldn’t be something that precious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve heard that something like that can also ruin someone and cause their demise.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monkey thought about Lu Yin’s comment and responded, “I’ve heard of that, but I’m not sure about the details. Alright, Seventh Bro, stop asking about that. You might not even see something like that over the course of your entire life. Think more practically and figure out where we are first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked up, as he had already thought about it. Any planet within the Innerverse or the Outerverse would be under the control of a great civilization, which meant that there would be traces left behind. Thus, he just had to find the location on this planet that featured the most legends.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before long, Lu Yin tore through the void and left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long after, the troops located and surrounded the building, but Lu Yin had already disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His gadget could directly invade any network on the planet, so Lu Yin quickly discovered that the most dangerous place on the planet was an oceanic trench located at the junction of several continents. It was hexagonal and immeasurably deep. It was a place where countless ships had gone missing since ages long ago. Other kinds of technology, such as aircraft, were no exception either. Anything that approached this oceanic trench would mysteriously vanish.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The planet’s most powerful country had explored this region, but they had found nothing at all and had no information on it. A country in the past had once blasted the ocean ravine with its most powerful weapons, but the only outcome had been a tsunami that caused countless deaths on the shores of the mainlands. Its actions had been condemned by the entire planet, and the nation had eventually collapsed shortly thereafter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless photographs of strange spacecraft had also been posted online, and they had all been taken close to the trench.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin rapidly sped through the void and soon arrived at the oceanic trench. His eyes filled with star energy as he looked down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He saw that there were many rune lines converging around the trench, and it represented a power that surpassed a Limiteer’s just based on sheer quantity, and it had even reached the threshold of an Explorer’s. This meant that there was something with an Explorer’s strength within the trench, though it was not necessarily human. It was also possible that it was some collection of energy, though of course, the possibility of it being a human was much higher.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regardless, this place presented no threat to Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He shot downwards and into the ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An enormous whirlpool instantly swirled about the ocean. It possessed a strong force of attraction, the power of which was not inferior to a Melder’s. This was also equivalent to the planet’s most powerful weapons being launched all at once, but it was no threat to Lu Yin at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bottom of the ocean was dark, but at the bottommost part, there was a small channel that sparkled slightly. Lu Yin used Flash to approach that place, and there, he saw a small warship outfitted with Explorer-level weapons. This spacecraft was what had generated those rune lines that had the power of an Explorer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, this planet was under the observation of a great civilization, which was a tragedy for the people of this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He effortlessly moved into the spacecraft and unleashed his domain, which allowed him to see a dozen people bustling around. Most of them were Melders along with a few Limiteers, but there were no Explorers here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He casually captured one of the people, and under their terrified gaze, he threateningly asked, “Where in the universe is this planet located?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That person looked at Lu Yin in fear. He had not expected for someone to suddenly appear on this spacecraft, but he replied in a trembling voice, “The Zhengyang Flowzone.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was startled. “The Zhengyang Flowzone? Where’s that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That man was puzzled, but he still answered, “It’s located at the junction between the Daynight, Spirit Seal, and Chaos Flowzones. It’s a bit to the west of the Innerverse.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was surprised, as Mister Mu had tossed him far west in an instant. He had simply assumed that he was still in Tempest Flowzone, so this was quite an exaggerated shift. He felt that the concept of distance simply did not exist to Mister Mu. If that man had wished it, then he might have even been able to throw Lu Yin back to Earth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Still, this place was convenient for him since he wanted to get to Chaos Flowzone quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He asked a few more questions before quickly knocking the person unconscious and hiding his limp body before heading to the captain’s room. He had to gain control of this spacecraft first; otherwise, he had no way to leave this planet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he approached the captain’s room, he was surprised to hear his own name being mentioned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did you hear about the Daynight Feast? That famous Lu Yin actually didn’t show up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone says that he died.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a pity. The Daynight clan mentioned that the four strongest Limiteers in the universe’s younger generation are Ye Xingchen, Mu Rong, Ling Que, and Lu Yin. If Lu Yin had showed up, then he could have fought with Ling Que to show who’s stronger.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re too naive. My friend’s brother’s ex-girlfriend’s uncle’s goes to the Astral Combat Academy. He heard that Lu Yin has some enmity with the Daynight clan and that they intentionally invited him alongside Ling Que and the rest in order to instigate a battle between them so that they could use those three to suppress Lu Yin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But Lu Yin is comparable to them, and he is even more famous. Why would the Daynight clan be so certain of suppressing him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lu Yin can compare to those three only because it’s rumored that he matched the Ten Arbiters’ Divine Fist’s record. In reality, another Arbiter has said that that record isn’t genuine and that Lu Yin is still slightly inferior to that Arbiter’s strength when he was a Limiteer. However, those other three are different. Let’s not even mention Ye Xingchen, who roams the Cosmic Sea for now. Mu Rong is a part of the Ten Arbiters Council and has been recognized by the Ten Arbiters as the strongest Limiteer while Ling Que is someone from the Lingling Clan. You should know about the terror of the Lingling clan. Lu Yin’s truly slightly inferior to the three of them.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you saying that they intentionally puffed him up?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It should be, but the Daynight clan’s scheme fell apart since Lu Yin didn’t even show up. He even died, haha.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s true, but this Daynight Feast raised Ling Que’s reputation up too much. Now, everyone in the universe knows his name. It was reported that he’s heading to the Starfall Sea to challenge an expert on the Top Hundred Rankings. After he wins, he’ll be the only Limiteer on the list! That’s too formidable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, those freak geniuses can’t be understood. For ordinary people, being able to withstand an Explorer’s attack while still in the Limiteer realm is already pretty decent, let alone challenging the Top Hundred. Those Realmbreakers who can challenge Explorers are all freaks, but this person can actually challenge the Top Hundred Rankings while doing so. Although they’re all a part of the younger generation, which one of them isn’t a freak themselves? They are definitely some of the most powerful Explorers, to the point where even those old Explorers won’t easily provoke them.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, and I also heard that, after the Daynight clan ranked those four experts, it caused a bunch of youths to become unhappy. Ling Que headed to the Starfall Sea, and many young powerhouses followed him there to challenge him.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah, our Young Master went there as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whatever, he isn’t even a Realmbreaker that can challenge an Explorer. He’s just there to watch the fun.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“True, though it’s a pity that we can’t watch. The Starfall Sea’s gotta be pretty lively right about now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stood outside the captain’s room and continued eavesdropping while he browsed through the official news related to the Daynight Feast. He found many pictures, and many young elites had appeared there. The most eye-grabbing person there was naturally Ling Que, and his Que's Mighty Slash had shocked the entire audience. To him, even <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Y</span>anqing had just been a prop. Quite a number of the experts who had attended the Daynight Feast had challenged him, but not a single one of them had been his opponent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin opened a video to take a look, and his face quickly turned solemn. This person was truly strong, and his Que's Mighty Slash contained an unusual strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que was from the Lingling Clan, which Lu Yin had not heard of before. Out of curiosity, he searched the network and found some basic information on them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The more he looked through the information, the more astonished he became. This Lingling Clan was a bit terrifying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was an extremely rare race of humans, and every one of their members had the ability to absorb other people’s innate gifts to use for themselves. Each person could absorb ten innate gifts at most, which would then merge into a kind of eternal innate gift. This eternal innate gift would be a combination of the original ones, and it would be considerably powerful. Thus, each member of the Lingling Clan was a powerhouse with an amazing innate gift.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the universe was vast and there were many uncommon races, there were still some people with innate gifts that went beyond comprehension. Lu Yin never would have thought that a race like the Lingling Clan could exist, where their members could actually select others’ innate gifts and then combine them into one. This was so ridiculous that, upon hearing about it, people would forget to curse their luck.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, there were extremely few members of the Lingling Clan. Otherwise, not even the Daynight clan would be able to compare to them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, no matter how rare their members were, that clan was the true leading powerhouse that controlled the Spirit Seal Flowzone, and any member that appeared there would be an absolute expert.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que was an elite amongst experts, as his Que's Mighty Slash was his eternal innate gift that he had solidified through the combination of various other innate gifts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was all information that could be found on the network. Next, Lu Yin used the authority granted to him by his Honor Points to search for even deeper records about the Lingling Clan, which allowed him to learn some information that was hidden to most. One thing that he discovered was that the Lingling Clan possessed a shocking inherited technique: the Soulsplitting Technique.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even after countless years, the war at the border of the Human Domain had not stopped even once. As such, no power was able to completely hide its inherited strengths. The Daynight clan was no exception, as Zhanlong Daynight’s Daynight Restoration Technique was something that had been recorded down. The Lingling Clan was the same, as their Soulsplitting Technique was their clan’s strongest inherited technique. Essentially, it let its user create a doppelganger, and each copy possessed the main body’s strength. It was truly an incomprehensible art.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin withdrew his gaze upon learning that there was actually such a clan. Their unique powers caused others to be speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh, Seventh Bro, are you looking at the Lingling clan’s information?” The Ghost Monkey was astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You know about them as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course. The Lingling clan is a huge headache for the Astral Beast Domain, and those people have all sorts of innate gifts. Their Soulsplitting Technique makes them even more terrifying, and most powerhouses are rendered powerless against the Lingling clan. Fortunately, there are only a few of them, and we haven’t faced any of them at the border warfront in recent years.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who’s there?” A voice barked, and a few people nearby suddenly stared at Lu Yin with evident surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin casually pushed the captain’s door open, and the two who had been conversing stared blankly at Lu Yin. They had been on this planet for quite a while, but they had never encountered any outsiders before. Thus, they were unable to react promptly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Activate the spacecraft and head towards Chaos Flowzone’s Deep Crimson Planet.” Lu Yin walked over to the screen and gave out some orders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, the people who had been outside the room charged in and aimed their weapons at Lu Yin. The two who had been in the room also finally reacted to his presence and asked, “Who are you?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin turned around, and his gaze flickered as a strong gale swept out from beneath his feet. This was a pressure caused by pure star energy, and the crowd was instantly pinned to the ground as their star energy guns exploded. “I need to trouble you, so start the spacecraft and &nbsp;head towards Chaos Flowzone’s Deep Crimson Planet.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd were overwhelmed by Lu Yin, as his strength horrified them. They did not dare to resist, and they immediately voiced their assent.</span></p>
