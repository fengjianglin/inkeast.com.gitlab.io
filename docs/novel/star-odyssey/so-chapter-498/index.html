 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-18dd6b1e-7fff-1bc3-3abf-8f2566297a8b"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Ling Que could even say anything in response, Zhanlong Daynight, who was nearby, rushed over. He attempted to land a blow on Ling Que while shouting, “Enough nonsense! The Daynight clan doesn’t need to fawn over anyone!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight’s attack turned into a strong gale that could be seen by the naked eye. It tore the ground apart with a tremendous noise, but Ling Que easily evaded the attack. He lifted a hand, and the blade of his Que’s Mighty Slash tore through the void and disappeared. Zhanlong Daynight’s face changed when their fists clashed, the void warping even as a result. In an instant, multiple layers of shockwaves rippled out from where Zhanlong Daynight was standing, spreading in all directions. The Que's Mighty Slash shot out of the void, headed straight for Zhanlong Daynight, but it was stopped midway by the shockwaves, which caused its power to drop substantially. Even though the attack caused Zhanlong Daynight to bleed, it was not enough to substantially damage him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a method that Zhanlong Daynight had spent a long time creating, and it had been made specifically to deal with the Que's Mighty Slash. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Against Ling Que, Liu Shaoqiu had used his Second Sword as a defensive countermeasure while also changing up his offensive strategies. Zhanlong Daynight, on the other hand, was capable of clapping his palms together to create shockwaves that could act as defensive barriers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que was amazed by this tactic. “Interesting.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right in front of the two of them, Nightqueen Yanqing cursed at Zhanlong Daynight’s stupidity inside her own head. She was not fazed by the battle, and with sparkling purple lights in her pupils, she suddenly yelled out, “Brother Ling!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que automatically looked in her direction, and his eyes met her purple eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immediately, the bottom of Ling Que’s feet turned to stone, and the stonification quickly spread to other parts of his body. This was Nightqueen Yanqing’s innate gift—purple eyes. Her eyes were able to turn anything into stone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que’s brows rose up, and he felt his body jolt. Right after that, a second Ling Que appeared. He had used his Soulsplitting Technique, and the Ling Que who had been turned into stone quickly vanished. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Miss Yanqing, you’ve gone too far.” Ling Que’s tone turned cold when he realized that he had been sneak attacked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing activated her Nightking’s Body and released her battle force even as she replied in an agonized tone, “I am sorry, Brother Ling. I didn’t wish for things to happen this way either. Please don’t hold it against me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a swoosh, Zhanlong Daynight shot past Nightqueen Yanqing and threw a blow straight at Ling Que while the Que's Mighty Slash in Ling Que’s hand flickered as it slashed out horizontally. A thunderous sound was heard as a spatial tear appeared that quickly ballooned to cross the entirety of Pyrolyte Lake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight’s body spun around as he evaded the attack. He then kicked out with his leg at Ling Que, and at the same time, Nightqueen Yanqing launched an attack from the another side.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que quickly twisted his body, swinging the large blade around as he did so, and moved away so that Zhanlong Daynight and Nightqueen Yanqing’s attacks landed on empty ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The earth instantly shattered, and all three of them were cast underground at the same time. Terrifying shockwaves shuddered through the land, causing the earth below to be sent flying up high in the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight and Nightqueen Yanqing immediately jumped up from beneath the ground. The next moment, a huge number of Daynight clan members from the surrounding area charged forward to attack the ground. The Daynight clan intended to use their combined power to defeat Ling Que.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From high above, Nightqueen Qiuyu stared intently at a screen. Would their strategy actually work?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qichen frowned, as Ling Que had been too careless in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Daynight clan had no slouches among them. Every member of the Daynight clan was capable of executing battle techniques that could attack their opponents’ spiritual force. Their coordinated attack just now had not been launched in hopes of damaging Ling Que’s body, but rather in hopes of damaging his spiritual force. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also the reason why the combined might of the Daynight clan’s attacks did not cause much damage to Pyrolyte Lake. Even though the naked eye could not see the blow that they had unleashed, it had actually dealt quite a significant amount of damage to Ling Que’s spiritual force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the round of attacks concluded, all of the Daynight clan’s members involved were out of breath. Zhanlong Daynight tightly clenched his fists. This was the first time he had ever attacked another person with an overwhelming numerical superiority. The coordinated group attack left him feeling sour, but it was inevitable since he could not fight against Ling Que on his own.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing had a look of longing in her eyes. She was hoping that Ling Que had been unable to withstand their attacks. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, reality ended up leaving all of them horribly disappointed. Ling Que slowly emerged from the ground with a sinister look on his face as sweat dripped down from his forehead. The series of attacks that he had received from the Daynight clan had not been entirely ineffective; they had caused him to become dizzy and had ignited his rage. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que raised his head, revealing a cold glare in his eyes. His gaze swept across all the people from the Daynight clan. “Do you all have a death wish?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing’s heart raced. She could tell that the situation had taken a turn for the worse. “Everyone, RETREAT!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight let out a low growl and aimed his fist at Ling Que. The unparalleled Limiteer paused slightly before leaping up with Que’s Mighty Slash in his hand. The void ripped open, and the tear continued to spread across the sky. Across from him, Zhanlong Daynight violently crashed to the ground, blood oozing from everywhere. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que swept his glance over his surroundings as the giant blade disappeared. The next moment, the throats of a dozen Daynight clan members were slashed open, instantly killing them. Nightqueen Yanqing’s pupils shrank, and she desperately tried to flee. Ling Que’s eyes narrowed and the massive blade disappeared again. This time, it was headed straight for Nightqueen Yanqing. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing’s scalp went numb. “Brother Ling, please have mercy!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A glimmer of icy arrogance flashed across Ling Que’s eyes. Even though he was vain and lecherous, that was just the kind of man that Ling Que was! He was one of the four unparalleled Limiteers and an extremely talented man from the Lingling clan. He was not someone who would take an insult lying down. Although he absolutely reveled in the Nightqueen’s respect and worship for him, that earlier attack had crossed his bottom line. Since that was the case, then he would just kill her!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Powerful cultivators all had a bottom line, and once that line was crossed, they would become savage beasts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing could truly see death’s door at this moment. It would take just three seconds, three seconds for her to be slain by his Que's Mighty Slash. One second, two seconds… On the third second, she suddenly stretched an arm out, grabbed Zhuo Daynight, and used her as a shield. Zhuo Daynight had been a part of the earlier attack. Now that Ling Que was about to deal her a fatal blow, she knew that, without a doubt, this was the end. She had no hope of escaping.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she was grabbed by Nightqueen Yanqing, Zhuo Daynight had a pale look of death on her face; her time had come.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Que's Mighty Slash emerged from the void, headed straight for Zhuo Daynight’s forehead. Ling Que showed no mercy, and his eyes were icy cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing hid behind Zhuo Daynight, her face white as a sheet. At best, Zhuo Daynight’s death would buy her another second of life. Although it was another second, Nightqueen Yanqing had no idea how she could possibly defend herself against Que's Mighty Slash. This man was just too terrifying!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In outer space, above the planet, Nightqueen Qiuyu was unable to bear the situation anymore. She was ready to take action as Nightqueen Yanqing could not die!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that very moment, the exact moment Zhuo Daynight sensed that her forehead was about to be pierced, two fingers suddenly appeared in front of Zhuo Daynight and grabbed ahold of the mysterious Que's Mighty Slash. After that, the void trembled, and everyone felt as if their hearts had stopped beating. Even the air itself went silent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone stared dumbfoundedly at the figure who had appeared in front of Zhuo Daynight. This man had just used merely two fingers to block the Que's Mighty Slash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que was thoroughly shocked by this scene.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How can this be? Not even Mu Rong can do that!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing stared at the man in disbelief. He was just centimeters away from her. Who was this strange man who had just saved her life? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Drip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Drip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood slowly dripped onto the ground. Even though the Que's Mighty Slash had been stopped, it had nevertheless still stabbed in between Zhuo Daynight brows. She had already fainted, or to put it more accurately, she was on the brink of death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man who was standing in front of Zhuo Daynight was, unsurprisingly, Lu Yin. He had witnessed this scene right as he had arrived at Pyrolyte Lake. He had immediately unleashed the grains of Fatesand in his heart and left arm to release a huge portion of his true physical strength, which was how he had managed to use only two fingers to stop the Que's Mighty Slash. Alas, he had still been too late, the blade had already stabbed between Zhuo Daynight’s eyebrows.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, Hai Qiqi covered her mouth. She could not bear to watch what was happening.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A blade stabbing someone between the eyebrows would cause their forehead to split open and basically guarantee death. This was not an injury that could be healed by even the best medication Shamrock Enterprises had to offer. Humans could usually recover from almost any injury, but there was no way to recover from a wound like this. Zhuo Daynight’s life had been snatched away the moment the blade stabbed her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pyrolyte Lake fell silent. Lu Yin’s arms trembled, and his eyes glistened as he looked at Zhuo Daynight. Zhuo Daynight, on the other hand, had dull eyes as she stared back at Lu Yin. All she saw was a stranger since Lu Yin had disguised himself. She felt no resentment, as death was a form of absolution for her. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Que's Mighty Slash that had pierced her forehead vanished, as Ling Que had taken it back. Lu Yin grabbed Zhuo Daynight as shockwaves pulsed out from his body, forcing Nightqueen Yanqing to stumble and take cover. He then charged away from Pyrolyte Lake since he had suddenly thought of something: the piece of white fruit. It was the same white fruit that he had used a vast number of star essences to upgrade to the point of it being able to instinctively avoid danger. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Trialmaster had once said that such a fruit became more potent over time, and that some could even gain the power of resurrection since they were chock full of life energy. While Lu Yin did not believe that this fruit could actually resurrect someone, this was the only way he had a chance of saving Zhuo Daynight. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone except Ling Que was stunned. Ling Que stared at Lu Yin for a moment before rushing after him, shouting, “Hey, wait! Who the hell are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Throughout the entire universe, there wasn’t a single Limiteer that Ling Que could think of who could stop his Que’s Mighty Slash with just two fingers. If Mu Rong wasn’t capable of such a feat, then it was unlikely for Lu Yin to be capable of it as well. So with that line of thought, who in the world was this person? This man had to be the most powerful Limiteer in the universe, and Ling Que had to find out who he was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que wasn’t the only person who was curious about Lu Yin’s identity, as everyone was wondering the same thing. This even included the various powers above the planet. Wen Qichen, Nightqueen Qiuyu, Elder <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span>, and the others were all intently watching the events take place at Pyrolyte Lake. They were all curious to find out how such a powerful Limiteer had come here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Northline Flowzone’s Granny Chan, Lily Anne, and a few others knew who this person was, but they had all been shocked when they saw how Lu Yin had blocked Ling Que’s blade. This went against everything that they knew about the power of a Limiteer. Even Enlighters like Granny Chan were completely lost on how a Limiteer could be so strong. This was just too amazing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que scurried after Lu Yin as he raised a hand and sent out another one of his Que’s Mighty Slash. The blade shot through the void and headed straight for Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin frowned as he still did not want to reveal his identity. He had Hai Qiqi leave while he spun around to face the giant blade. Right when it appeared, he shifted his body to the side. He then tightly hugged Zhuo Daynight and charged at the ground while spitting out a glob of blood. Right before he landed, Lu Yin threw a feigned look of reluctance at Ling Que and then sped away at his top speed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que remained standing in the same spot, bewildered. The man had clearly just been hurt since there was a trace of blood on the blade, but if that was the case, then how had he stopped Ling Que’s blade earlier? He could not come up with an appropriate answer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was baffled by what had just happened, but there was only one possible explanation. The man had most likely used an innate gift to block the Que's Mighty Slash, but the innate gift was not one that could be sustained for a long time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the only possible explanation that people could come up with. Each innate gift in the universe was unique, and there were all sorts of innate gifts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only other explanation was that the man had pretended to be injured, but no one present could think of why someone would fake such a thing. This event should be a great way for this person to become renowned throughout the Human Domain, so it seemed unlikely that he had faked his injury.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As people’s thoughts kept going down such a path, many of them heaved sighs of relief. They had reassured themselves that no Limiteer could be so unreasonably powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had pretended to be injured by the blade to confuse everyone since he did not wish to expose himself. As for the identity of the person who had rescued Zhuo Daynight, although suspicions might fall on him, as long as no one could know it was him for certain, it was alright.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he tightly held onto Zhuo Daynight, Lu Yin stomped on the ground, creating a fissure that he jumped into. Now that he was away from the watchful eyes of all of the observing powers above the planet, he went ahead and pulled out the white fruit from his cosmic ring. He then forced Zhuo Daynight’s mouth open and stuffed the fruit in. Now, whether or not she recovered was left solely up to luck.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, what did you just feed that woman? Why did her life force suddenly surge?” the Ghost Monkey asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
