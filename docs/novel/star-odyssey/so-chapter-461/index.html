Work hard, and who knows? Perhaps one day, you’ll be able to go to the Starsibyl Clan and buy this Starsibyl to take home as your maid.” The Ghost Monkey snickered. He wasn’t actually trying to mock Lu Yin since he could tell that Lu Yin was being honest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone had their own pursuits. Starsibyl had heard all sorts of answers before, but Lu Yin’s answer truly confused her. Those who qualified for her to ask this question were all freaks of the universe. Rich kids did not qualify to even meet her, but because of who she asked this question to, there had never been anyone who had answered that their dream was to become rich. Lu Yin was the first.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was slightly confused at this moment. She had the feeling that this man had given her the most pathetic answer, but at the same time, it might also possibly be the most daring one.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is my answer very strange?” Lu Yin asked while appearing curious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Starsibyl gazed at him and could only respond, “Every person has a different pursuit.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin made a sound of acknowledgement. “How does my answer compare to Wen Sansi’s?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Starsibyl was shocked, not having expected Lu Yin to ask such a question. Could the two answers even be compared? One was about learning and studying while the other was about making money, something even a fool could do! She had no idea where Lu Yin found the confidence to assume that he was on par with Wen Sansi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Starsibyl did not answer his question. Instead, she merely said, “There is something that I need to do, so I need to leave now. Goodbye.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded. “Okay.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as she was about to leave, Lu Yin suddenly remembered something and yelled to her, “By the way, I met Grandpa Jiu.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Starsibyl paused and turned around, her face suddenly ashen. “Be careful of what you say, Lu Yin.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin asked, “Isn’t Xuan Jiu your Grandpa Jiu? He carries around a huge banner that says that he’s Starsibyl’s Grandpa Jiu.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Starsibyl frowned. She rarely showed such an expression to people, as she almost always had that enigmatic smile on her face. “That person has nothing to do with me. Please do not bring him up again.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She then tore through the void and left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin sighed. He hadn’t intended on purposefully angering Starsibyl, as he had merely been trying to discover how much truth there was to Xuan Jiu’s words. That man had once told Lu Yin that he had stared into the eyes of the dead. In the past, Lu Yin had no idea what those words were supposed to mean. But now, after having run into the Specter Clan and merged into one of the clan member’s bodies through his die’s Possession, could it be that the Specter Clan represented “the dead” since they possessed death energy? If that was the case, then Xuan Jiu had not been telling him about the past, but rather about the future. That would truly be divination.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin wanted to know if Xuan Jiu truly had the ability to divine the future. Based on Starsibyl’s reaction, Xuan Jiu was more than he seemed to be. She clearly wanted nothing to do with that man and had tried to evade the matter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Also, Lu Yin felt like he had caught a glimpse of Hai Dashao, who probably had heard his answer. Hopefully, that guy had been so disappointed by Lu Yin’s answer that he would try to get the Sea King to call off the engagement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve got a question that I’ve been wanting to ask you,” the monkey suddenly said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you going to ask why I’m so eager to earn money?” Lu Yin replied.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monkey answered, “No. I want to know where the money you’ve earned has gone.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin pursed his lips. That was a question that was very difficult for him to answer. “That’s private, so don’t ask again.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monkey was speechless. “By the way, why have you been blocking me every time you spend money?

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin frowned. “What kind of place are you talking about?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s where humans give in to their most primal urges!

Stop making wild guesses.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You haven’t gone there? That’s impossible. What else could you be spending your money on? Could it be that you spent it all on games and equipment?” The monkey felt absolutely certain in his guess this time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked confused. “Games? Equipment?”&nbsp;</span></p>

You humans have created a bunch of different kinds of battle-games. A lot of young people are addicted to these games. You must have spent all your money on buying new techniques!” the monkey exclaimed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin didn’t even want to respond anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You shouldn’t get addicted to games, Seventh Bro. Those techniques are all fake, so you won’t be able to use them in real life,” he sagaciously advised Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin blocked off the star energy to his right arm. That monkey was being a nuisance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As time passed, the news that Lu Yin was set to become the Sea King’s son-in-law spread through the universe like wildfire. It was talked about everywhere within the Chaos Flowzone and Daynight Flowzone. This was one of the benefits of having a universal network connect the Human Domain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Nightqueen Yanqing found out about this matter, she was absolutely devastated. She’d been patiently waiting for her clan to stop bothering with Lu Yin so that she could thoroughly crush him, but then, all of a sudden, he’d become entangled with such a powerful person. The Sea King no less! He was a person whom even the Daynight clan had no wish to provoke without good reason.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a bang as she punched the ground. Ruining Lu Yin had become her foremost priority by now, something that she absolutely had to accomplish no matter what! She’d never been defeated so thoroughly before. Not only had Lu Yin personally defeated her in front of an audience, but she also couldn’t do anything to him even with the help from her clan. She had the power to imprison someone like Zhanlong Daynight with her influence as a Nightqueen, but such power was useless against Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She knew his weakness, but there was nothing she could do about it at all, and it was driving her mad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a thing had already happened multiple times in the past; whenever she wanted to make a move against him, she had been stopped by something. Lu Yin had already become her inner demon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, her gadget sounded out with a notification. She answered it and was met with a face she had come to hate. “Become an Explorer as soon as possible. The clan is going to send you into the Astral Wilderness to gather a certain substance.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person on the screen was Nightking Yuanjing. This was the person who was always preventing her from destroying Lu Yin, and this was honestly killing her inside. However, there was nothing that could be done.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, sir,” she answered in a low voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing stared at her intensely. “I’m warning you once again: don’t lay a hand on Lu Yin. He is not someone who you have the right to touch. The clan has its own plans for him.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing’s eyes flashed with a cold glint as she ended the connection. She looked up and clenched her fists. She would wait. As long as her brother was still set to become the leader of the Nightking Clan, she would continue to reign above the others. Her day would come soon enough.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After contacting Nightqueen Yanqing, Nightking Yuanjing called Lu Yin right away. He was eager to talk to Lu Yin since the Sea King could become a strong ally of the Daynight clan. The moment Lu Yin truly became the Sea King’s son-in-law, the Daynight clan could make use of him to more easily enter the Starfall Sea and explore that area that numerous people wanted to know more about.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon enough, the call connected, and Lu Yin appeared on the screen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had been reciting the Stonewall Scriptures since he had nothing else to do. It was quite surprising that Nightking Yuanjing would take the initiative to contact him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hi there, Grandpa Yuanjing!” Lu Yin greeted the old man with an enthusiastic smile, as if he’d forgotten about the scheming that had been gone on back on the spacecraft.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing’s wrinkles creased as he smiled kindly at the youth. “I’m so glad you’re fine, Lu Yin. I heard that you took part in the Sea King’s son-in-law selection. Such an event will create a lot of enemies, so make sure that you don’t overdo things.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked touched, and he hastily replied, “Thank you for the concern, Grandpa Yuanjing, but I’m doing fine.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing looked happy at his answer. “That’s good. By the way, I’ve translated the text that you showed me before. Would you like to know what those words mean?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s heart skipped a beat, and he stared at Nightking Yuanjing in shock. The old man was actually willing to share such sensitive information with him? It appeared that the Sea King had a reputation that was far beyond what Lu Yin had initially imagined! This meant that he no longer needed to worry about the safety of Frostwave Weave. It would be for the best if he could maintain his position as the Sea King’s publicly announced son-in-law until he was able to become more powerful himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, if Nightking Yuanjing was willing to share the translation of that text with Lu Yin, then that also indicated that it wasn’t all that important.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That should be a top secret of the Daynight clan, Grandpa Yuanjing. It’s best if I don’t know,” Lu Yin said, putting on an expression as if he was caught in a difficult position even though he really wanted to know.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing chuckled. “Since you call me Grandpa, then the Nightking clan can be considered as your home. Family members naturally have the right to this knowledge!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was about to vomit. The old man was so fake! Of course, Lu Yin was just as bad since he made sure to appear delighted. “Thank you, Grandpa Yuanjing!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing made a sound of acknowledgement, obviously pleased with such a response. “It roughly translates to: ‘Hate cannot protect you! Await the end of rain. Hate! Hate! Hate!’”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was confused; what did that even mean? It sounded incredibly sinister.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing noticed Lu Yin’s perplexed expression and explained, “It probably has something to do with a grudge between some ancient powerhouses. We don’t know much either. If you’re lucky, you might be able to find out in the future.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin could only smile. “If even the Daynight clan doesn’t know, then there’s no way I’ll be able to find out. Regardless, thank you for being so kind to me, Grandpa Yuanjing.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha, you’re no outsider. By the way, are you currently at the dome?” Nightking Yuanjing inquired. This was what he was truly interested in discovering.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded and sadly answered, “The Sea King locked me up and said that I can’t leave until I become an Explorer. I’m in a bit of a sticky situation.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing solemnly answered, “He’s trying to help you. You will have to do something for him in thanks in the future.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin adjusted his expression. “I understand. Don’t worry, Grandpa Yuanjing.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing grunted. “You don’t need to worry about your Frostwave Weave. As long as the Daynight clan is around, nobody will be able to meddle in its affairs.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you so much, Grandpa Yuanjing!” Lu Yin exclaimed gratefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not much more time passed before Lu Yin ended the call. His face became contemplative. So it turned out that the Sea King’s influence was actually this powerful, which meant that Lu Yin could rest easy. This was something that he had not expected at all. Even an elder from the Nightking clan had called to butter up to him. This indicated that Lu Yin’s status as the Sea King’s future son-in-law was definitely something worth having.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Also, it was quite a surprise that the Daynight clan had been able to translate that bit of text. The amount of time that had passed since it had been first written down was enough for even brick walls to erode into powder, but the Daynight clan had already successfully translated it. Such an achievement showed just how terrifying the clan truly was. It was far beyond Lu Yin’s imagination. Was he destined to forever be the underdog and perpetually keep pretending with Yuanjing?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To be honest, everything would be fine as long as Lu Yin became the Sea King’s son-in-law. However, that was not taking Hai Qiqi’s terrible personality into consideration. After all, what would become of Ming Yan? The reason why Lu Yin had been training this hard all along had been because he detested being restricted by others. If he gave up on what he loved just because he wanted to forge a connection with the Sea King, then what was the point of training this far?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A person should decide what was important to them and then follow through on that. Lu Yin didn’t mind being humiliated if it allowed him to achieve what he wanted. However, he could never give up on what he truly wanted, not even if it meant death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, it wouldn’t be easy for him to become the Sea King’s son-in-law either. It might seem like Lu Yin had received the Sea King’s acknowledgement, but Lu Yin couldn’t be certain what that man actually thought of him. Lu Yin wasn’t so narcissistic that he believed that the Sea King would force him into this marriage. The future was completely unknown to Lu Yin right now, as everything was in the Sea King’s control. It was a terrible feeling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Lu Yin’s biggest headache was how he could leave this place. It felt like it would take him ages to break through and become an Explorer.</span></p>
