This was the strength of a powerhouse from the Sixth Mainland who could compete for the position of one of the Daosource Three Skies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hold on.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Lu Yin suddenly recalled something.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Gong is from the Lingling clan, and the Lingling clan has the Soulsplitting Technique!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Above the cauldron, White Knight had been stabbed through, and Blood Looney pulled his hand back to taste the fresh blood. The red color in his eyes grew even brighter as he continued to stare into White Knight’s eyes. He saw the suffering in them, and this excited him to no end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Blood Looney’s gaze trembled. As he stared into White Knight’s eyes, he saw his reflection, behind which a figure had suddenly appeared. He whirled around, only to see a spear about to pierce through his throat. At the last possible moment, Blood Looney raised his hand and grabbed a hold of the spear, his nine lined battle force causing White Knight to halt his advance. “You- you’re not dead?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Looney was certain that he had just killed White Knight, as what he had just seen and felt was something that could not be faked. So how was there now another White Knight?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Knight’s spear vibrated and swept Blood Looney’s hand aside. Then, his spear lashed forward again, striking Blood Looney’s body and sending him flying away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beneath the two, the castle that had stopped spreading began to slowly release a certain radiance that caused all the blood lotuses in its surrounding area to completely evaporate away. A grand clock rang out, sounding as if it had come from a palace in the heavens.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Looney clutched his chest. Fresh blood dripped down from the corners of his lips, and he stared intently at White Knight with a berserk light in his eyes. “How is this possible? How could you defeat me?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Knight’s spear was aimed straight at Blood Looney. “I’ve already told you that you guys have no future, not even your so-called ‘Daosource Three Skies.’ You are all just slaves to a rigid cultivation system, and just you guys alone cannot beat us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After speaking, White Knight thrust their spear forward once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Looney was infuriated, and the blood lotuses that were sealing off the cauldron’s entrance melted away, returned to blood, and were reabsorbed back into Blood Looney. His entire body turned a scarlet red, and he charged at White Knight with a rabid expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Knight’s gaze trembled, and the castle’s radiance expanded once again as the spear continued piercing forward.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a bang, a massive spatial crack split the sky apart, and an intense gale swept out in all directions, causing many of the surviving cultivators to spit out blood. Even Lu Yin felt his heart lurch and his chest tighten, causing him to nearly spit out blood as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sky warped as the two figures mutually repelled each other. This was an all out collision between the two powerhouses, and both the blood lotuses and castle disappeared at that moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two figures crashed into each other atop the cauldron, and they spat out blood at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The outcome of their fight could not be determined, as both had been injured in this exchange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blood lotuses that had sealed off the top of the cauldron had also disappeared, as this last strike had injured both of the fighters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the two of them were still blocking the exit, and no one dared to charge past them and escape.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, a noise could be heard from outside the cauldron, and White Knight leaped up and left. It seemed that White Knight had heard someone else outside the cauldron, which had prompted them to leave as, being someone from the Fifth Mainland, White Knight would have to face attackers from all sides wherever they went. White Knight was thus left with no choice but to flee given their injuries.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Looney stared off into the distance with an unwilling expression as he clenched both fists tightly. If he had been able to absorb some more of this person’s fresh blood, then he definitely would have become strong enough to defeat the current generation’s Daosource Three Skies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go!” someone within the cauldron barked. They were all afraid of being trapped by Blood Looney once again. Although he was currently injured, the disparity between his strength and their own was too great; they didn’t dare to contest Blood Looney even with his injured state.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Less than twenty people inside the cauldron had survived the battle, and they quickly all dashed out and fled in various directions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Looney became flustered even as he spat out a mouthful of blood. He had indeed wanted to seal off the top of the cauldron once again, but it was already too late. His only choice was to choose a random direction and chase down whoever had fled that way. Coincidentally, he chose the direction that Lu Yin and his companions had fled in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why is this lunatic chasing us?” Huang San was terrified. He had woken up, and upon regaining consciousness, the first thing he saw was Blood Looney running after them. “Did you guys piss him off?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We should split up. Since he dares to chase after us, it shows that his injuries are not too severe and that he still has the confidence to deal with us,” Mr. Bai suggested, and Miss Qing and Lu Yin agreed with him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Split up? Who should I follow?” The fatty was horrified, as he was the weakest out of them all, not to mention the slowest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin frowned, as this stupid fatty was truly troublesome. He was about to answer when the fatty vanished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was speechless. For the fatty’s time to expire at this moment showed that he enjoyed exceptional luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Bai, Miss Qing, and Lu Yin thus went their own ways, each choosing a different direction.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Looney growled in anger. If he had not been heavily injured, then there was no way he would allow any of these three to slip away given his top speed. He glanced around, chose a direction, and then continued to chase after one of the youths.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, that lunatic is chasing you!” the Ghost Monkey shrieked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin turned around and coincidentally exchanged glances with Blood Looney’s red eyes. His expression changed. “Why is he chasing me? Can he tell that I’m from the Fifth Mainland?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, you’re really a firefly in the dark! You get chased wherever you go!” the monkey wailed in agony.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had no choice either, but then he suddenly thought of a possibility. Two days ago, he had been the only one who was able to remain standing during the battle between the two young powerhouses, and he had even been able to drag Mr. Bai and the other two youths in their group away. Perhaps that incident had caused him to stand out in Blood Looney’s eyes, making Lu Yin seem very powerful, or at the very least, stronger than the others. This would make Blood Looney think that Lu Yin’s blood would be more advantageous for him. It had to be said that the lunatic had guessed correctly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin smiled bitterly, as he should have tried to behave in a more low-profile manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind him, Blood Looney took action, and summoned a corpse dragon from his body that shot through the sky and towards Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin further increased his speed, but the space ahead of him suddenly split open. He hurriedly dodged to the side as the corpse dragon rushed into the spatial crack and disappeared. However, another corpse dragon dashed out a short while later to chase after him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The space in the Nine Cauldrons’ region was comparatively stable, but Lu Yin would actually prefer it to be unstable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if Blood Looney was currently injured, he was still very fast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can’t catch me! Go and kill someone else!” Lu Yin shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Looney grinned coldly. “It has to be you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin thought of turning back and giving his all in a fight, as the Yu Secret Art combined with the Dream Finger might actually be enough to deal with the injured Blood Looney. Still, Lu Yin decided against that course of action after thinking about it more.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He continued to flee for a while longer until he finally saw a light pillar ahead of him; this one was located in the center of the Nine Cauldrons’ region. Lu Yin was delighted, and he quickly dashed towards it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Looney snorted coldly, and he raised a hand, causing a giant blood lotus to appear in the sky as he attempted to crush Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The light pillar was right in front of Lu Yin, so he raised a hand and casually waved it in response, activating the Yu Secret Art. Immediately, the blood lotus attack was diverted in another direction.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Looney’s pupils shrank. “Is this a battle technique? No, with your strength, there’s no way a battle technique could withstand my attack… This is a secret technique! You know a secret technique!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin gritted his teeth and stepped into the light pillar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop running! Hand over that secret technique!” Blood Looney gave his all and ferociously spat out a mouthful of blood. The blood formed a mist that surged around him and enveloped his body. He then tore through the void and instantly appeared in front of Lu Yin, stepping into the light pillar at the same moment as Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s scalp went numb even as the scenery changed before his eyes. He left the region with the Nine Cauldrons and instead appeared in an area riddled with canyons. But more importantly, Blood Looney appeared there at the same time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Looney grabbed Lu Yin’s shoulder, and Lu Yin reached out to grab Blood Looney’s wrist in turn. The two were both using their physical strength at the same time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Looney’s wrist shattered into pieces, leaving him shocked. How had he actually lost in a battle of strength? Without hesitation, his nine lined battle force burst forth, and he swatted out with a hand. Lu Yin also released his seven lined battle force while his Fatesand formed into a shield in front of him. There was a thump, and the Fatesand trembled while Lu Yin was sent flying out of the light pillar. He knew that he was outmatched, and instantly he moved to escape into the distance without turning back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Looney coughed out yet another mouthful of blood, as he had been severely injured during his battle with White Knight. Despite that, he had forced himself to use his battle techniques and even activated his nine lined battle force to chase after Lu Yin, which had further aggravated his injuries. But for a secret technique, he was willing to pay anything. As long as he could get that secret technique, his power would undergo a groundbreaking transformation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why did he want to become one of the Daosource Three Skies? Aside from the experts from the Secret Progenitor Realm, the experts of the Blood Progenitor Realm and the Martial Progenitor Realm also wanted to obtain a secret technique. Blood Looney’s true objective was to become one of the Daosource Three Skies , and he would only reach an invincible position if he grasped a secret technique. And now, there was a secret technique right in front of his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Looney slapped his own chest, and his face went pale as he spat out another large mouthful of blood. This time, the bloody mist reinforced his body, and he instantly tore through the void to chase after Lu Yin again, immediately appearing behind Lu Yin. Behind Blood Looney, the imprint that he had received from the Bluedome Elder reappeared, and an enormous pressure caused Lu Yin’s back to turn cold. “Stop right there and hand over the secret technique!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, Blood Looney grabbed at Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin paused and turned around with a raised finger. His eyes suddenly went slack as he lost consciousness. A boundless rage surged through him, and the Dream Finger tapped out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The void froze, and only that finger was able to transcend space to tap against Blood Looney’s palm. The finger easily pierced through the palm and continued moving towards his brain, as if it intended to crush his brain within his skull.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it did not succeed. Blood Looney was too powerful, and Lu Yin could not touch him even if he pushed this technique to the point of his finger splitting. Helpless, Lu Yin pulled his finger back, but the power of that finger had already forced Blood Looney back by a hundred meters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The void recovered, and Lu Yin continued fleeing once again, though his finger was now bleeding.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Looney was stunned, and he tightly clutched his shoulder as fresh blood flowed from beneath his palm. How was this possible? An Explorer had actually injured him? That finger had cut off all possible means of evasion. What sort of battle technique was that? This person had a secret technique, an invincible battle technique, and even battle force on top of all that! He was an absolute monster!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wait a minute, he never used an imprint at all.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Blood Looney’s head snapped up. There was only one possibility where someone would not use their imprint at such a critical juncture. Could this person be yet another survivor from the Fifth Mainland?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Looney snarled loudly. He had to capture this person, as his secret and battle techniques were the best gift possible for Blood Looney after being locked away in cryostasis for a thousand years.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite being repeatedly injured, Blood Looney still did not give up the chase.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was also feeling helpless, as this madman must have guessed that Lu Yin was not someone from the Sixth Mainland by now. Lu Yin knew that would be in deep trouble if he bumped into anyone from the Sixth Mainland at this juncture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Lu Yin’s thoughts reached this point, he saw that there was someone up ahead of him, lighting a fire. This new person’s posture seemed like they were intending to prepare some food to eat. Lu Yin wanted to avoid them, but after a moment’s thought, he didn’t. At this moment, what Blood Looney wanted to do the most was to obtain Lu Yin’s secret technique, and thus, the madman would not allow Lu Yin’s identity to be exposed for fear of Lu Yin being captured by someone else. This meant that anyone who appeared in their path, regardless of whether they were from the Fifth or the Sixth Mainland, was an enemy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was very expectant as he charged towards the area with the fire, hoping to encounter a ruthless character, as even someone like Autumnfrost Qing would be enough at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Looney had also seen that there was someone lighting a fire up ahead in the distance, and he ground his teeth so hard that he almost spat out another mouthful of blood while his face paled even further. If he wanted to acquire this secret technique, then he would require quite a long period of recovery after this, but it would all be well worth it for a secret technique. Anyone who blocked his path had to die.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">***</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nong Zaitian had always believed that he was an ambitious youth. Since a young age, he had held a dream, which was to spread his brilliant image across the entire Sixth Mainland—not just throughout the Blood Progenitor Realm, but even to the Martial Progenitor Realm and the Secret Progenitor Realm. Everybody everywhere should know of his glorious image.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, this dream had been shattered the moment he became more sensible. His name meant that he was fated to never acquire any glory. And that indeed turned out to be the case: there was nothing wrong with anything else about him, as his appearance, personality, and even social skills were quite decent. It was just his name, which was the greatest stain on his life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had thought of rebelling and changing his name, but when he tried, he had failed, and he had nothing to show of it aside from being beaten countless times. However, he had never thought of giving up, and had instead decided to change his name after becoming a top-notch expert. But as he matured, the ancestors in his family had given him a power vessel, and after receiving it, Nong Zaitian realized that he would never be able to shake off his name, as that power vessel was actually a hoe.</span></p>
