 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-3cfe7a1c-7fff-6b55-ca0e-fb6f2280355d"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kong Shi fell silent for a moment when she heard Lu Yin’s question before finally saying, “I don’t know. The strength that you showed today is enough to prevent her from defeating you, but neither are you able to defeat her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And with those words, she left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin let out a breath. He had not been confident about his chances of defeating Kong Shi. After all, she was a peak Hunter, and she had not used a single battle technique or innate gift during their spar, only her raw strength as a Hunter. On the other hand, Lu Yin had used his full physical strength, Fatesand, and domain. Due to this discrepancy, he believed that his current strength was not enough to defeat a peak Hunter like Kong Shi who surely had an excellent innate gift.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He might be able to defeat an average Hunter, but his chances of beating Kong Shi were slim. At the very least, he would not be defeated by her, though that was not due to his universal armor, but rather the Yu Secret Art. With the secret technique, Kong Shi’s attacks could be easily negated, and Lu Yin had also comprehended the Secret Sidestep technique.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kong Shi had also indicated that Cool Sis, who was ranked tenth on the Top 100 Rankings, was able to rival Kong Shi herself. So was Cool Sis a Realmbreaker then? This also seemed to imply that she was not a regular Realmbreaker either and that there was a large gap between those in the top ten of the rankings and those below them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Lu Yin faced off against Nightking Gu again, then it would not be too difficult for Lu Yin to win. Even so, Kong Shi believed that Lu Yin was not capable of defeating Cool Sis, which showed that the disparity between them was great.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had previously guessed that, once he broke through and became an Explorer, it might be possible for him to enter the top fifty, whereas Wendy Yushan had estimated that he would be able to enter the top thirty. Reality had proven both of them wrong; Lu Yin was actually able to rival the top ten, and this was when his domain was not completely unleashed. Moreover, he still had one hidden move left up his sleeves, though he didn’t know if it could actually be used. Once it was activated, its might would likely be very terrifying. It was the finger from his dreams.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once again, Lu Yin stepped into the top ten of the Ironblood Points rankings. The moment his name reappeared, it left An Shaohua speechless, who was currently stationed in another one of the five lower strongholds. He felt like Lu Yin was just playing around; why else would he keep jumping up and down through the rankings unlike anyone else.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Xianzi had a complex expression, as this person only became more unfathomable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan smiled; everything else was fine as long as he was still alive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another battle broke out again unexpectedly. When the astral beasts appeared in the gaps of the sourceboxes’ formless danger zones, a huge wave of attacks burst forth. However, they were all blocked by an Enlighter realm Amethyst Beast. The creature already had an impressive defense to begin with, and despite it only having a power level of around 200,000, Elder Lohar was the only person in Ironblood Weave who could fight against it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless attacks smothered the Amethyst Beast, but they were all to no avail.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, a large group of Void Wanderers appeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the command center, Wang Wen gave the order, “Smash them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next moment, dozens of grams of pyrolyte were thrown towards the invading astral beasts. This pyrolyte had belonged to the Blaze Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Explosions with a force that could rival attacks with power levels in the hundreds of thousands shook the region, tearing space apart as if it was a curtain, creating countless blackholes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a furious roar, the Enlighter Amethyst Beast smashed its way directly towards Brokenblade Fort. At the same time, Monster Loach appeared and erupted with the full force of its power level of 300,000 as it also crashed towards Brokenblade Fort.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Lohar shot up into the sky and pushed the Amethyst Beast back before attacking Monster Loach.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless Void Wanderers were eliminated, but more continued to appear in an unceasing wave, and each one of them carried numerous groups of beasts with them, many of which were space-exploring powerhouses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Experts like <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span>, Huo Houye, Posion Flame, Anfield, Kong Shi, Liu Miaomiao, and Huo Qingshan all dashed into outer space.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin donned his universal armor and similarly leaped up as seven lined battle force erupted from his body. Nearby, Long Yun also charged upwards, though he was a bit stunned when he saw Lu Yin’s battle force. Not much time had passed, but this kid had already upgraded his battle force. What a monster!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were five Enlighter beasts among the invaders. Han Fei, <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Topmist</span>, and Huo Houye took on three while Elder Lohar single-handedly dealt with the Amethyst Beast and Monster Loach. The Hunters, like Kong Shi, along with Poison Flame, restricted one while Wang Wen had Lu Yin take on the final one.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Wen had his own plan of defending while the astral beasts similarly had their own invasion strategy. This was especially so after encountering someone as unconventional as Lu Yin, a human who had all sorts of sneaky tricks. One particular Enlighter beast had already made preparations for him, and it formed a mass of shadow that attacked the new Explorer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, be careful! That’s a Shadowbeast!” The Ghost Monkey became frantic.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin subconsciously dodged, but his head was still hit by a strong force, and his entire body was sent flying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s that?” Lu Yin asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A Shadowbeast! It’s an astral beast that can hide in the shadows and launch attacks from there. It has no material body, so they’re very difficult to face,” the monkey said solemnly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin frowned, “A Shadowbeast? How do we deal with it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me think,” the monkey replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was another thump as Lu Yin was struck once again. The Shadowbeast was unlike the other Enlighter realm beast, as most of them could only unleash sneak attacks by hiding in the void. But this particular beast only needed to hide within Lu Yin’s shadow, and its fighting style would be a problem for any Enlighter to face, not just Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>

Seventh Bro, find a place without any light sources! As long as there are no shadows, that thing won’t be able to get close to you,” the monkey shouted.&nbsp;</span></p>

But the heavens were huge with light sources everywhere. How could he find such a place?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“BLACKHOLE!” the monkey screamed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked up. Many blackholes had been created by the detonated pyrolyte, and there was definitely no light to be found within them. Thus, no shadows could be produced there either. However, Lu Yin was too scared to enter a blackhole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Relax, Seventh Bro, those aren’t real blackholes. The sky in this place is false.” The monkey paused briefly before hurriedly continuing to say, “A destructive strength with a power level in the mere several hundred thousands isn’t enough to create a true blackhole that can swallow everything. In fact, the blackholes created from a planet’s explosion isn’t real either. They all belong to the surface layer. Don’t forget—even a blackhole-grade Aurora can pass through these blackholes, let alone you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin ferociously dashed towards the blackholes. According to the rune lines that he could see, they were not much of a threat to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A shadow appeared before him, and Lu Yin casually waved a hand and activated the Yu Secret Art. At the point directly in front of him, the shadow attack missed, and it only managed to shatter some layers of the void.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Shadowbeast clearly wanted to stop Lu Yin from entering a blackhole. However, Lu Yin managed to rely on the Yu Secret Art and the Secret Sidestep Technique to shake off the Shadowbeast. He then directly charged into one of the blackholes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an instant, the gravity nearly caused him to lose control of his body. He thought of Tian Hou, as that freak was essentially a living blackhole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Shadowbeast’s rune lines neared Lu Yin, and the creature dashed into the blackhole right behind Lu Yin. It had no intention of letting Lu Yin off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was not a single ray of light in the blackhole, and it incessantly tried to pull Lu Yin into an unknown space. He filled his eyes with star energy and looked around him, only to see that even rune lines were distorted in this place. He could not track the Shadowbeast’s position at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, think of a way to attack the Shadowbeast, or else it’ll just toy with you until you die!” The monkey was flustered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was similarly anxious. He was in a position where all he could do was evade the Shadowbeast’s attacks. However, with the size of this blackhole, he would eventually be hit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Any attack from Lu Yin would be too weak to do anything to an Enlighter, and only his gun would be effective. “Monkey, aren’t you a shadow as well? Can you hide in its shadow?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monkey was stumped. “I- I don’t know.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Try!” Lu Yin then dashed out of the blackhole since it was useless to keep hiding within it, especially since he could not remain hidden for long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Lu Yin emerged, the Shadowbeast left the blackhole as well. Its boundless rune lines immediately vanished, only to suddenly strike at Lu Yin. The beast had hidden itself within Lu Yin’s shadow again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the Ghost Monkey appeared. While Lu Yin was being attacked, the monkey locked onto the Shadowbeast’s position. Lu Yin fired his gun, but the Shadowbeast had already disappeared. It was aware of how dangerous the gun was, so it was very cautious. However, the monkey also turned into a shadow and latched onto the Enlighter’s shadow. So, when the beast reappeared, Lu Yin waved a hand and activated the Yu Secret Art. The bullet vanished, only to reappear and strike the Shadowbeast. The Enlighter had been hit. Even though its body was immaterial, that did not mean that it couldn’t be hit. As long as its shadow was hit, it would be similarly affected.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Shadowbeast did not expect for Lu Yin to have a tamed beast in his body, much less one that could follow and reveal its location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That shot wasn’t enough to kill the beast by itself, but it was certainly enough to scare it off, and the beast immediately distanced itself from Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ghost Monkey reintegrated into Lu Yin’s body afterwards. “Seventh Bro, I never thought that there would come a day when this monkey would help you deal with an Enlighter!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stored his gun away and sighed. There was only one shot left. “That Shadowbeast won’t give up. Get ready to stop it again.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monkey was excited. “Alright!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin glanced at the monkey, and his eyes flashed. This monkey still thought that Lu Yin had not caught on to what he had said about the false sky. The monkey clearly knew something, but he had never elaborated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Battles were erupting in every corner of Brokenblade Fort, and Lu Yin could not afford to wait for when the Shadowbeast came looking for trouble again. He still had one bullet left in his gun, and he wanted to use the Yu Secret Art to help the Enlighters deal with the beasts. However, at that moment, he saw that Wang Wen was surrounded by beasts and two Hunter beasts at that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin quickly dashed over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“SAVE ME! SAVE ME!” Wang Wen shouted urgently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two giant Hunter beasts were angrily trying to smash the coffin apart, but they quickly realized that they couldn’t do a thing to it. Then, one of them opened its mouth and moved to swallow the coffin whole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Wen’s face turned deathly white.</span></p>

They came from the Myriad Swords Peak’s senior disciple Linley and <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Lilyrose</span>, respectively. The two had acted to deal with the Hunter beasts, which allowed Wang Wen to breathe easy again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Linley wasn’t able to hold out for long before being sent flying by one of the beasts’ tails; his sword qi had not been able to harm the beast in the least.&nbsp;</span></p>

After that, sword qi streaked by to pierce the two Hunter beasts before tearing through the void.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Linley spat out a mouthful of blood from where he was laying on the ground.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Linley looked devastated. Were they going to die?</span></p>

Her last attack had been made with all of her strength. Run? She couldn’t escape, and the most unfortunate part was that she still had not tasted enough men!</span></p>
