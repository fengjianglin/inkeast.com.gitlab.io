As the number of figures continued to increase, the piece grew even more melancholic, and every note was full of bleakness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the music stopped, and Nightqueen Yanqing looked at the score in excitement. “I’m giving you all a mission: go to Frostwave Weave and massacre all of the space-exploring powerhouses of the Great Yu Empire. Don’t let a single one get away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes,” the kneeling crowd acknowledged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing’s lips curled up in a merciless smile. The clan had finally lifted the restriction on interfering with Frostwave Weave. She had immediately acted, ready to make Lu Yin regret his entire life. She would not immediately destroy the Great Yu Empire, as she was planning on slowly toying with it instead. She had a great deal of spare time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the people before her were just Cruisers, the Daynight clan’s Cruisers were incomparable to a Cruiser of the Outerverse. If these people united, then they could even challenge a Hunter. Thus, she was effectively sending a few Hunters, which would be more than enough to deal with the Great Yu Empire’s Hunters and eliminate the entire upper echelon of the Great Yu Empire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But then, there was a sudden soft beep, and Nightqueen Yanqing looked at her gadget. Her face quickly changed, and an intense coldness shone through. She tried to make a call, and Nightking Yuanjing’s figure quickly appeared on her display.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Yuanjing, why did you reinstate the restriction concerning the Frostwave Weave?” Nightqueen Yanqing suppressed her rage when speaking to the elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He replied in a deep voice, “You don’t need to know about that. I will explain to Zhenwu. The restriction stands.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing widened her eyes. “What exactly is your relationship with Lu Yin?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing did not bother replying, and he simply disconnected from the call.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To every powerful clan in the universe, the most important priority for them was always their inheritance. The Daynight clan valued the submitted ancient words that Lu Yin had submitted, as these characters represented culture, which also stood for inheritance. Even if the content of the words held no intrinsic value, the words themselves were worth studying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One set of words in exchange for a period of noninterference in the Frostwave Weave’s war had been Nightking Yuanjing’s proposed deal to the elders of the clan, and it was precisely this deal that had denied Nightqueen Yanqing her bloodlust. Nightking Yuanjing did not explicitly state how long the restriction would last, which meant that he could rip up the deal at any time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing looked at the hazy moonlight outside, and her entire body trembled in anger. Thrice she had tried to act against Lu Yin. And thrice she had been restricted, each and every time. Very well, she would wait. She refused to believe that the elders would continue to protect that person, which meant that, one day, she would trample him beneath her feet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, she was not the only one shocked, as Hui Daynight was similarly stunned by the news.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was the one who had informed Lu Yin that the restriction concerning the Frostwave Weave had been lifted, and even though only a brief amount of time had passed, the restriction had already been reinstated. Just what exactly had Lu Yin just done?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Lu Yin became incomparably mysterious to Hui Daynight. It was no wonder why he had dared to oppose the Daynight clan in the trial zones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind Lu Yin and the others, a radiant-grade Aurora shot through space, carrying Feng Mo of the Relentless Slayers. He had accepted Deep Crimson Hall’s mission to capture Lu Yin and the rest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he was uncertain about the information concerning Lu Yin’s group, they had appeared on Deep Crimson Planet, and their pictures had long since been transmitted to Feng Mo’s gadget. With his strength as a Hunter, they would not be able to hide from him even if they changed their appearances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite the vastness of outer space, there were not that many habitable planets. With the Relentless Slayers’ methods, details concerning any spacecraft that landed on one of these planets along the route had already been investigated. This method wasn’t something exclusive to the Relentless Slayers, and most of the powerful organizations of the universe could employ similar methods. Otherwise, no one would be able to find someone who hid on some random planet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Feng Mo’s strength, it would not take him too long to cover a planet with his star energy. Hence, he could search through even uninhabited planets quite quickly, and this also ensured that his targets had nowhere to hide. He could follow the signals from the trackers on Big Pao and Little Pao, but there were no other such devices on the others. Thus, he had to manually search for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The universe is vast, but there’s only one path to escape.” Feng Mo’s eyes remained cold as he stared ahead. As he passed by a planet, his star energy formed into a squall that swept over it, overwhelming all the Explorers on the planet. They merely trembled, not daring to resist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo quickly scanned the entire planet and then continued on his way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If not for the need to scan every single planet, he would have long since caught up to the fleeing students as his Aurora traveled ten times as fast as a normal spacecraft.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at that moment, he received an assassination request. Although the mission’s location was in the exact opposite direction of him, it wasn’t too far from his current location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He hesitated as he looked at the enormous bounty on the request. He then turned the vehicle around and headed towards the location specified in the request.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Space-exploring powerhouses could alter their physical bodies to adapt to the universe, but they also consumed star energy as an energy source; otherwise, their physical body would become exhausted. This was the so-called “period of exhaustion,” and in general, an average Explorer had to consume at least ten million star crystals at the end of a cycle to avoid entering it. This was equivalent to about one hundred star essences. As a Hunter with a power level above 150,000, Feng Mo needed to consume at least 10,000 star essences if he wanted to keep his body from lapsing into a period of exhaustion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also just the most basic consumption rate. The techniques that Feng Mo had cultivated actually required even more star energy than normal, so he required many times that figure, which meant that he needed to consume a terrifying amount of resources just to maintain his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When his cultivation resources, breakthroughs, battle techniques, and other various transactions were added on, Feng Mo was short on money even though he was a Hunter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Otherwise, why would a grand Hunter turn into a killer? There were many powerhouses throughout the universe, but each one was helpless in their own way. Even a powerful clan like the Daynight clan did not allocate resources to their clan members as extravagantly as an outsider might imagine, and the Mavis Family might be the only exception.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo felt strange as he looked at the mission details. The target was only an Explorer, so it should not be necessary for a Hunter like himself to act. The other party had also requested for him specifically to take on the job, and he had no reason to turn it down since it wasn’t too far away from him either.</span></p>

Thus, he could spend a few additional hours to finish this job before continuing his previous pursuit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo was full of confidence as he headed towards the location of this mission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two hours later, just as he was about to arrive at the site of the job and descend into the planet’s atmosphere, the mission details suddenly changed, causing Feng Mo to frown. A mission update was uncommon, and the client would need to compensate for any losses incurred due to the changes. However, the condition for that compensation was that the killer completed the mission; otherwise, the additional compensation would not be paid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo looked at the updated mission location. It was another hour away from his present location, so he still had time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the fugitives’ small vessel’s flying speed, it would take them at least ten days to reach the Starfall Sea. Feng Mo thought about it and then confidently continued on his way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin and the rest did not remain idle during this time. They had already changed their route and were planning on visiting the closest busy planet with the goal of buying a small Aurora. As for their funds, although Lulu was rich, she wasn’t foolish, and she had no intention of paying for everything herself. This was especially so since a small Aurora was not cheap, as they cost at least fifty star essence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her thought process was correct, but unfortunately, reality was different from her intentions; the other students were broke. Coco and Zora were poor, and Hui Daynight was the same. Xia Luo simply raised both of his hands to show his willingness to allow Lulu to search his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin wanted to do the same, but he was currently quite rich, and he could not hide it. Finally, he shouldered the burden along with Lulu, and they bought a small Aurora together. Their new ride allowed them to continue on towards the Starfall Sea at ten times their previous speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo did not have access to any real information concerning Lu Yin’s group, and he never would have thought that a bunch of youngsters could afford an Aurora, which cost at least 500,000 star crystals. Only great powers could be so wealthy, and their heirs would not have to run and hide like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He would not know that it didn’t matter to Lulu whether or not they hid, as their goal was just to protect Big Pao and Little Pao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At another planet, Feng Mo arrived at the new location for his assassination mission, only for the target’s location to change once again. Feng Mo was not stupid, and he immediately realized that something fishy was going on and that someone was deliberately delaying his pursuit. This shocked him; who could possibly have such a deep understanding of the Relentless Slayers that they could even track his whereabouts?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Mo wanted to continue, since a mission could not be changed too many times, and he would receive compensation after a maximum of three changes. However, the mission details this time had changed to a location that was even further out of the way. If he continued trying to complete this assassination mission, he would not be able to chase after the previous group of fugitives .&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, after Feng Mo weighed all the pros and cons, he chose to abandon the mission. He then sped straight towards the Starfall Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the small Aurora, Xia Luo put away his gadget and looked at Lu Yin. “Feng Mo’s on his way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded. “That’s to be expected. After living in the universe for so long, it would be strange if he couldn’t realize that there was something strange going on. He’s rather decisive, and it also seems that Deep Crimson Hall has offered him a significant payment for us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nearby, the others were listening, and they also knew about Feng Mo. Little Pao said, “The powerhouse from the Relentless Slayers who helped Deep Crimson Hall extinguish Blackfire Hall back then was also Feng Mo.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It looks like his relationship with Deep Crimson Hall runs rather deep,” Xia Luo commented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cold glint flashed through Little Pao’s eyes. “Almost half of Deep Crimson Hall’s resources are given to him, so their relationship is naturally not something superficial.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, an alarm sounded in the spacecraft, and everyone turned towards the command room. Michelle frowned. “There’s a ruined nebula up ahead, so we need to reroute.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They looked at the screen, and their route kept changing for a bit before it finally settled on a new path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they looked at the new route, their hearts sank; this rerouting had delayed their arrival at Starfall Sea by seven hours.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seven hours. Will Feng Mo catch up to us with this?” Coco asked in a worried voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Michelle looked at their new route. “The timing isn’t what’s important. Rather, it’s that this new route needs us to retrace our path for quite a while, which means that we’ll be heading back towards Feng Mo.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Which means that we might meet Feng Mo during that stretch,” Lu Yin said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Michelle looked at him. “Or we could change our destination and not head for the Starfall Sea.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To the northwest of the Starfall Sea was originally the Outerverse’s Endless Weave, but unfortunately, that area has been taken over by the Technocracy, so there’s no other choice,” Xia Luo said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin forced out a smile. “There’s no other choice then. We’ll head towards the Starfall Sea. We’ll just have to hope that we’re lucky and don’t get caught.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group felt helpless, but they really didn’t have any other choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The network contained no information about Fatesand, and even Lu Yin’s Honor Points status weren’t enough for him to find any information.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, you’re searching for information about Fatesand? Didn’t I already tell you that that thing’s an ultimate treasure? It’s possible to never even see it during your entire life. To clarify, even the top ten of the Top 100 Rankings might not have some,” the monkey said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin indifferently replied, “I have three grains fused into my body.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monkey didn’t believe him in the slightest. Forget three grains, it would be an amazing stroke of luck to get just one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin sat down cross-legged and unleashed his domain. His eyes filled with star energy as he looked at his heart, his left arm, and his right leg. These three areas showed many converging rune lines, and the more lines that he saw, the greater the influence that thing had on the universe. These three areas converged towards Lu Yin’s star energy and vigor, suppressing his physical strength. More shockingly, the converging rune lines had surpassed even those of his own body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who knew when they would awaken.</span></p>
