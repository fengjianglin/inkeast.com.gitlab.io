 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-3cb10512-7fff-9cbf-66f7-9ff3423caa78"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“By the way, you seem to have quite a few enemies, and even the Ten Arbiters are against you. I feel like I’ve been tricked into something.” The Ghost Monkey’s voice sounded out in Lu Yin’s mind again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the tamed monkey hadn’t spoken, then Lu Yin would have forgotten that there was something he did not have total control over in the Time Stop space. He absolutely could not let this astral beast see him rolling his die. Who knew if it would one day escape from his control. With this in mind, he turned around and headed towards the entrance of the teleportation arena. He wanted to speak with Kuang Wang and learn more about beast taming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon after, Lu Yin appeared next to the Ocean of Death within the Dao of Heaven. Kuang Wang wasn’t there, so Lu Yin found someone from Astral-5 and requested to meet with Kuang Wang inside one of the trial zones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they saw that it was Lu Yin making the request, the person's face took on an expression of worship as they immediately agreed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the recent Astral Combat Tournament, the treatment that Astral-10’s students received in the trial zones had improved drastically now that nobody dared to make life difficult for them. Regardless of whether it was Big Pao, Little Pao, Xia Luo, Silver, or Lulu, all of them were very strong. Lu Yin, in particular, was more powerful than most academy leaders, and was one of the strongest people in the entire Astral Combat Academy. Even Area Masters would be very polite when they met Astral-10 students.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Lu Yin’s first time visiting the Dao of Heaven. The trial zones were a simulated world, but they contained ancient inheritance within themselves. It was a strange place where even the Ghost Monkey could accompany Lu Yin. Having a tamed beast was apparently considered a type of ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is this one of the so-called trial zones that belong to the Astral Combat Academy? Hey, have you killed a war spirit before?” the Ghost Monkey asked, sounding very excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nonchalantly answered, “Yup.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What did it feel like? What did you see?” the Ghost Monkey eagerly asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Lu Yin was about to answer, he suddenly had a random thought. How did the Ghost Monkey know about the war spirits here? Also, there were so many other things that he could ask about, but he was specifically inquiring about war spirits. Why?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin casually replied, “I didn’t see anything other than…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Other than what?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ghost Monkey seemed anxious to hear his next words, which caused Lu Yin to smirk. “...Other than some strange things that I couldn’t understand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What was it?!” The Ghost Monkey became increasingly distressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, Lu Yin was able to confirm that the Ghost Monkey actually knew something about the war spirits. However, the monkey was just a student of the Astral Beast Domain’s Sky Academy. Even if it was a top student there, he’d still only be comparable to an academy leader from the Astral Combat Academy. How did he know the secrets of the trial zones? Even Hunters weren’t this knowledgeable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go on! What exactly did you see?” The Ghost Monkey was getting frustrated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s tone suddenly turned cold. “What do you know? Spit it out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ghost Monkey froze before responding in a mocking tone. “Me? What could I know? I was just curious, that’s all! Don’t overthink things.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin frowned in displeasure. “You’ve been with me for long enough to know my general characteristics. I don’t like it when people hide things from me. You know a little too much for a mere student. I’ll give you one last chance. Tell me what you know, or I’ll end you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fine, fine. You always use this move on me. Just wait. I won’t let you do this again.” The Ghost Monkey was left with no choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin chuckled. He had finally seen through this guy’s character. This astral beast may seem fierce, but he was all talk. When he did know something, he would easily spill the beans with a minor threat. It was a wonder how he’d managed to survive in the Astral Beast Domain for as long as he did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, the trial zones that your Astral Combat Academy own came from a unique civilization known as the Runemasters.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was surprised. “Are you saying that they cultivated by drawing runes on paper?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who said anything about drawing runes on paper? I don’t know anything about that, but the Runemasters’ cultivation method was essentially linking runes together and creating space with them. In their eyes, whether it was a being, an environment, or a planet, everything was formed from runes. Their battle power was a representation of how many runes they could see. For example, a person might only be able to see a hundred runes at first, but the stronger they grew, the more they could see. Take a planet, for instance; it might consist of a million runes. It was a very interesting civilization. These trial zones should have been left behind by them. Their characteristic ability was to see through the laws of this world and change material things into a simulated reality. They could also turn these virtual simulations into material items,” the Ghost Monkey explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was surprised, “Such a civilization existed? Does that mean that they were able to create miracles?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can put it like that. This civilization was very powerful and had a very unique way of fighting. They focused on erasing their opponents’ runes, which was the same as disrupting the essence of their opponents’ attacks. But then, their entire civilization mysteriously disappeared without a trace one day. Regardless of if it’s their cultivation methods or their bodies, nothing remains other than some scattered ruins. These trial zones are one of the few things that were left behind,” the Ghost Monkey said ruefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin recalled what he had seen with the Cosmic Art after killing a war spirit; there had been some strange characters formed from lines. Could those have been the aforementioned runes?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How do you know so much?” Lu Yin found this matter strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ghost Monkey was very proud of himself. “I know a lot of things. If you want to know what I know, then you’d better treat me well. I even know about Progenitor Wushang and the Runemasters, and Progenitor Wushang is an even older existence than the Runemasters.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin narrowed his eyes; there was something off about this Ghost Monkey. Not even a Hunter would know all of this ancient history, much less a Limiteer. This guy was definitely worth milking more information.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Maybe you could try killing a few more war spirits. You might even obtain some kind of Rune Technology inheritance from these runes! It’s a very strange way of attacking, but don’t tell anyone about this,” the Ghost Monkey suggested.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had no interest in such things. He knew that it was better not to bite off more than he could chew. If he had extra time, then he was better off training and refining his battle force. He wanted to raise his battle force to nine lines and see how powerful it would be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the two were conversing, Kuang Wang arrived. “I heard that you were looking for me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin nodded. “I wanted to ask about the Dao of Heaven’s Sea of Death.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kuang Wang’s eyes narrowed. “You want to steal the Dao of Heaven’s Realm Master position?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course not. I’m just curious about it. I’ve heard that the Ten Arbiters have been here before,” Lu Yin hastily responded. He wanted Kuang Wang’s help, so it wouldn’t be wise to offend him here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After confirming that Lu Yin really wasn’t there to take his position, Kuang Wang sighed in relief. He wasn’t sure if he could win against Lu Yin—no, it was more than that; he was certain that he wouldn’t be able to win. While Kuang Wang might have been reckless, he also knew his own strength. “The Sea of Death is the Dao of Purgatory’s strangest training ground. There are rumors that…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin actually held no interest in the Sea of Death and had only brought it up as a conversational topic. After listening to Kuang Wang’s explanation about the Sea of Death, Lu Yin asked, “By the way, I’ve always been curious about how you guys from the Beast Tamers Flowzone fight. Do you let your tamed beasts out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kuang Wang nodded. “Kind of. Actually, tamed beasts don’t have bodies of their own, and you need techniques to tame them. Why are you asking about this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If I had a tamed beast, is there a way for me to hypothetically block off its senses?” Lu Yin asked. This was what he really wanted to know.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing this, the Ghost Monkey exclaimed, “Hey, what are you doing?! Stop it, bro, we’re sharing one body. Everything I do is for your own good…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kuang Wang looked at Lu Yin oddly. “You have a tamed beast?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin casually shrugged. “I’m just interested in it, and I was thinking of learning about it at the Beast Tamers Flowzone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kuang Wang burst into laughter. “Sure. If you go to Beast Tamers Flowzone, you’ll definitely be able to join the Divine Grade Hall. They’ll even teach you the technique there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can you briefly tell me how it works?” Lu Yin asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kuang Wang gave Lu Yin a strange look and focused on his right arm. After considering things a moment, he answered, “Well, it’s very easy to block off its senses. You just have to cut off its access to your star energy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s all?” Lu Yin was surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What did you think it entailed? Taming beasts is just one of the myriad forms of battle techniques. And without star energy, battle techniques are useless. This applies to tamed beasts as well. Every action that a tamed beast takes requires star energy, so the basic principle of controlling it is controlling its star energy,” Kuang Wang explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bro- no, Seventh Bro, please don’t do anything! I want to be able to see the outside world! I don’t want to die without knowing how it happened! Please, Seventh Bro, I’m begging you. Don’t block me…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monkey’s voice gradually faded away after Lu Yin had cut off all star energy from going into his right arm. After the Ghost Monkey’s voice disappeared, Lu Yin suddenly felt refreshed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If it’s not necessary, there’s no need to block a tamed beast’s senses. That’s because once you successfully tame a beast, they definitely won’t be able to leave you. If they do, they’ll immediately die since you’ve become one entity,” Kuang Wang said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin knew that Kuang Wang had guessed that Lu Yin had a tamed beast, but Kuang Wang had purposefully not exposed him; Kuang Wang wasn’t dumb. “Thank you for letting me know, Kuang Wang.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person being addressed stretched leisurely. “When are you joining the Council of Astral Academy?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin shook his head in response. “Not now. It’ll have to wait until after I become a Limiteer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That makes sense. Nobody can go against a decision made by the Ten Arbiters. By the way, if you manage to break through on time, you can go straight to the Tilting Tower and have them notify the other academy leaders. They’ll then hold a student council meeting there since that’s where they’re usually held,” Kuang Wang said before moving to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin thanked him once more and then let the Ghost Monkey regain access to his senses. “You and I have one body, Seventh Bro. There’s no need to block me out.” The Ghost Monkey felt maligned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You babble too much,” Lu Yin dryly replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ghost Monkey had no response to that. “If you block me out, then I won’t be able to tell you about a lot of things.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That doesn’t matter to me. I’m happier without you.” Lu Yin acted nonchalant about the Ghost Monkey’s supposed benefits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ghost Monkey tried to test the waters. “Is there something that you’re trying to hide from me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin blocked off the star energy in his right arm again. It was time to roll his die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an abandoned area of Astral-10, Lu Yin let out a light breath and spread his fingers as his die appeared, whirling slowly in the air. It had been around two months since he had last rolled it, and there seemed to be a relationship between how long he waited between rolls and how likely it was for him to get the result that he wanted, such as Six: Possession or Three: Enhance. He hadn’t rolled six pips in a while, so it was probably about time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin rolled his die, and as he watched it spin, he had a strong feeling that he really might get six pips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When it stopped spinning, Lu Yin saw six pips on the die’s face, and the scenery before his eyes changed. He saw the familiar darkness filled with little specks of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was more experienced now, and he knew that the more attractive a speck of light was to him, the better it was as a match. The specks of light quickly flitted through the dark space. Lu Yin had ten star essence in his cosmic ring, which was equivalent to about a million star crystals. It might seem like a lot, but he could use them all up in a single moment. Lu Yin did not dare waste too much time in this dark space as he would rather spend the star essence on extending the time he Possessed another person for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did not hesitate, especially since he couldn’t tell who he would be Possessing anyway. Lu Yin chose a random speck of light that was fairly attractive and charged over to fuse with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Lu Yin opened his eyes again, he saw he was in a room with an ancient air to it. There were wooden tables and stools, paper lanterns, and copper mirrors. This was an ancient civilization.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few moments later, Lu Yin finished going through the basic memories of the person whom he’d fused with. This man’s name was Wu Xia, and he was the butler for the Shenwu<a href="#footnote_1" id="footnote_ref_1">[1]</a> Empire’s Crown Prince Residence. He was a peak Fighter, which meant that he was the same as a peak Melder. He was also on the verge of breaking into the Martial King realm, which was the equivalent of a Limiteer.</span></p>
