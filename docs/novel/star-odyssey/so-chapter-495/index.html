 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi blinked and grinned. “Who knows? But you can keep guessing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had asked just for fun, but by the looks of it, it really seemed like she might have comprehended a forcefield. Lu Yin still only knew of three people who had comprehended a forcefield, so if Hai Qiqi had truly done so, she would be the fourth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A forcefield was an incredibly powerful ability. Mu Rong had been able to force Ling Que to split his soul into three clones with just his forcefield. And Liu Shaoqiu’s forcefield, the Fourth Sword, had helped him conquer Pyrolyte Mountain. A forcefield was not something that just anyone could comprehend. Lu Yin had struggled just to comprehend a domain, so he didn’t even think about what his chances of comprehending a forcefield were.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Hai Qiqi really did have a forcefield, then she must be rather powerful. At the very least, her strength was comparable to Zhang Dingtian’s, which was to be expected of the Sea King’s daughter. Although she was not a fighter and had never experienced a bloodbath before, she was definitely not weak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s the range of your forcefield?” Lu Yin asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi thought it over before replying, “I’m not sure, but it should cover quite a large distance.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Help me find something.” He tapped on his gadget and showed her a picture of Zhuo Daynight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi rolled her eyes at him. “Why should I?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you help me find her, you can go wherever you want,” Lu Yin temptingly replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi’s eyes lit up. “Deal!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, she started unleashing her domain at full force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Hai Qiqi had released her domain earlier, while the average Limiteer cultivator might not have realized it, the geniuses had all become aware that someone amazing had arrived. And so none of them dared to release their own domains to challenge her. However, they had ultimately decided to band together, and with the goal of challenging the girl next to Lu Yin, they started to surround the two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pyrolyte Lake was massive, and while the various Limiteers were fighting against each other, they had also made an agreement to work together in order to resist the heirs of the major powers. At this moment, Hai Qiqi and Lu Yin fit the description, so the combatants had decided to first work together and eliminate these two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin quickly realized what was going on and scanned the area behind him. There were five people working together, and each of them was equal to a genius from a large organization. Each of the five had comprehended a domain, and if they had been in the Astral Combat Academy, then they would have become Area Masters at the very least. One of them might have even been strong enough to become a Realm Master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, these people were still weak in Lu Yin’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi didn’t even bother with them. She continued to use her domain to search for Zhuo Daynight while Lu Yin slowly turned around, raised his hand, and then directed it at one of the geniuses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Spacerender Palm.” As he spoke, his palm vibrated in such a way that the void distorted while a shockwave appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, the five attackers became horribly startled. Through their domains, they could tell how terrifying Lu Yin’s attack was, and the one who had been targeted by Lu Yin’s palm strike shrank back and hurriedly tried to escape. Shockwaves brushed past him and sent him flying while half of his body went numb from the attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not interested in this place. I’m just here to look for someone,” Lu Yin stated coldly as he looked the four remaining people up and down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They eyed him fearfully. This person was terrifying! He was also a Limiteer, but why was the gap between them so large? He was most certainly a monster and was clearly somebody who they couldn’t provoke. Not a single one of them spoke a word as they all immediately moved away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In order to survive in the universe, it was better to have friends than enemies. Lu Yin did not enjoy killing, and unless it was absolutely necessary, he would avoid doing so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle for Pyrolyte Lake had been going on for quite a while, and the intensity had not let up at all. The lake was originally a dull red, but the fresh blood had stained it into a brighter scarlet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spacecraft shot down from the sky and landed around the lake as even more Limiteers came out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi searched for quite some time, but she finally shook her head. “I can’t find her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was rather disappointed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi offered, “I’ll try again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin did not say anything. While he really didn’t want to admit it, it was very unlikely that Zhuo Daynight had survived. Even if she was alive, there was an extremely miniscule possibility that she had come to Pyrolyte Lake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi suddenly shrieked and looked to the east.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s wrong?” He asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi pointed to the east. “Some powerhouses from the Daynight clan are here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin frowned and gazed in the direction she had pointed in. He saw that there were about twenty people charging towards the lake, and the one leading them was Nightqueen Yanqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pyrolyte Mountain had already been taken over by the Sword Sect. Thus, the Daynight clan was trying to gain control of Pyrolyte Lake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of a sudden, Lu Yin’s expression changed. His gaze locked onto a figure who wasn’t that far away from Nightqueen Yanqing. It was Zhanlong Daynight.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I’ve been looking for you.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, Lu Yin barely resisted the urge to rush over, seize Zhanlong Daynight by the neck, and question him on how he’d managed to leave the Shenwu Continent and if he’d come to some kind of agreement with Ming Zhaoshu. However, Lu Yin instead decided not to make a rash decision. This wasn’t the right time to expose himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The arrival of the Daynight clan meant that they would soon be the owners of Pyrolyte Lake. Even if all the present Limiteers here banded together, they still wouldn’t be a match for the twenty new arrivals. Besides, they were all too afraid to fight against the Daynight clan anyways.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi had been using her domain to look for Zhuo Daynight when her domain bumped into a domain genius from the Daynight clan, which was how the two of them had been found out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Numerous Daynight cultivators appeared in front of Lu Yin and Hai Qiqi, glaring coldly at them. “Who are you?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you doing? Trying to find out how many people are here?” Hai Qiqi shot back sarcastically.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That was your domain, wasn’t it?” the Daynight cultivator asked as he looked at her, seeming rather cautious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi pointed at Lu Yin. “It was his.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was speechless since the person in front of them could clearly sense the truth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Daynight clan cultivator frowned. “I don’t care who you are, but Pyrolyte Lake belongs to the Daynight clan now. Please leave this place immediately.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin didn’t want to expose himself and pulled Hai Qiqi away, intending to leave. However, at that moment, Nightqueen Yanqing showed up. While she hadn’t comprehended a domain, she could still tell how powerful Hai Qiqi’s was. The fluctuations from the girl’s domain had shocked her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait.” Nightqueen Yanqing stood in front of them, carefully studying Lu Yin and then Hai Qiqi. “Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi rolled her eyes. “You guys from the Daynight clan must be here to figure out how many people are here. What’s it matter to you who we are? Get out of our way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin sighed. They were going to get in a fight. This brat had always been amazing at provoking people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As expected, right after she spoke, the people from the Daynight clan became furious. Nightqueen Yanqing raised her brows. “Didn’t your parents teach you any manners? I guess I’ll have to do it for them.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Hai Qiqi might have a sharp tongue, she wasn’t always trying to pick a fight. However, she found Nightqueen Yanqing to be a horrible eyesore, especially with her ample breasts. Visually, the woman was aggravating, so Hai Qiqi went straight to it. “Sure thing, old aunty. Thanks for making it clear how old you are.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing was now thoroughly enraged. Being called “old aunty” reminded her of Yōu Ye’er, as those were the exact same words that stupid girl had used to insult here. And now, there was another little bitch calling her the same thing. Nightqueen Yanqing somehow correlated Hai Qiqi to Yōu Ye’er, and her four-lined battle force exploded forth. Her purple eyes flashed, and she punched out at Hai Qiqi, wanting both of these two girls to pay for insulting her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi smirked as the void around her trembled. Her domain was enough to cause Nightqueen Yanqueen to freeze while a sound reminiscent of the roar of the sea could be heard. The air seemed to solidify into layers as it formed a terrifying force that swept towards Nightqueen Yanqing. However, the latter’s attack could not be stopped, and it tore straight through the domain, allowing her to grab Hai Qiqi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl immediately cast a pitiful look over at Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had no choice, so he grabbed Hai Qiqi and took another step to instantly break past Nightqueen Yanqing and move far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing’s attack did not end up landing on anyone, and she appeared to be rather shocked. After looking around, she focused on Lu Yin; his speed was stunning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even further away, above Pyrolyte Lake, Zhanlong Daynight looked over as well.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’s fast! Interesting…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His competitive side started coming out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin knew that things couldn’t wait any longer, or else Zhanlong Daynight would show up. That was why he had grabbed Hai Qiqi and hurriedly left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait! Hey, wait a second! I’ve got a question!” Hai Qiqi squirmed while in Lu Yin’s grasp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stopped. “What?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi gazed at Nightqueen Yanqing and pointed at the woman’s breasts. “Those things are fake, right? They’re drooping.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Drooping… Drooping… Drooping…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From all around Pyrolyte Lake, numerous people stared at the girl in a daze. She had a particularly loud voice, and it wasn’t just Nightqueen Yanqing who had heard her; the other Daynight clan members and even the escaping Limiteers had heard her. At this moment, numerous eyes were inadvertently drawn towards Yanqing’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing went completely red and her eyes turned murderous. She screamed, “YOU STUPID GIRL!! I’M GOING TO KILL YOU!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She activated her Nightking’s Body and recklessly charged at Lu Yin and Hai Qiqi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin grinned, grabbed Hai Qiqi, and continued fleeing at a speed that far outpaced Yanqing, soon disappearing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of that one thing that Hai Qiqi had said, even Zhanlong Daynight had not been able to stop himself from eyeing Yanqing’s chest, which was why he hadn’t helped out. Those words had been lethal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing growled crazily up in the air, releasing a huge amount of star energy around her and far into the distance. Her fury had peaked, and she’d never been so angry before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Far in the distance, Lu Yin looked at Hai Qiqi in awe. For some reason, this girl seemed amazing to him at this moment. Speech was oftentimes considered an art, but Hai Qiqi’s speech was a weapon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, I suddenly find myself liking this girl. When we run into other enemies, just let her mock them. I guarantee that there’ll be a huge group of people that’ll die of frustration!” the Ghost Monkey snickered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was actually considering the monkey’s suggestion as it did make sense. He had been able to tell that Nightqueen Yanqing’s breathing had become ragged just now. If she had been in that state during the Astral Combat Tournament, Lu Yin would have easily won that match.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, what are you staring at me for? I’m warning you, you’re not getting me or my heart!” Hai Qiqi grew cautious of Lu Yin’s attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked away. It was only now that he realized that Hai Qiqi must have actually been holding back when speaking to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing did not pursue them since she wasn’t able to catch up, but Lu Yin didn’t go too far away either. Only the Daynight clan would possibly know of Zhuo Daynight’s location, so he was planning on capturing one of the clan members and asking them where she was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Near the lake, the atmosphere had become a bit odd. The Daynight clan had gained control of the area, and the other cultivators had retreated, leaving the region in silence. However, the remaining people couldn’t help themselves from occasionally sneaking peeks at Nightqueen Yanqing, and especially at her breasts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing clenched her fists as her face turned red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Leave for a while. It won’t take them long to leave,” Zhanlong Daynight said as he walked over to her, though he himself unconsciously took a glimpse as he was speaking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing glared furiously at him, but she did not leave. She’d always been stubborn, and the more people who looked, the more insistent she was on staying. She was the younger sister of Arbiter Zhenwu, and she wouldn’t embarrass him. If people were going to look, then so be it!</span></p>
