 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-4a638101-7fff-332b-0ed2-44c744e5b0ca"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Gu promptly avoided Wendy Yushan’s sword before tearing through the void to once again appear behind the pair and unleash a punch. However, he was obstructed by the soil clod yet again as Wendy Yushan stabbed at him with her sword. It was a familiar routine, but Nightking Gu was not struck since he managed to dodge aside quickly enough. However, he was now helpless against the pair. Once they combined their strength, he could no longer defeat them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyu was furious, as the Daynight clan had gone to great lengths to drag Nightking Gu out of cultivation, but he was still not powerful enough to seize control of the mountain range. Helpless, she stepped out of the Daynight spacecraft and appeared within the Sword Sect’s vessel.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a long while, Lu Yin and Wendy Yushan were both panting heavily as they stared vigilantly at Nightking Gu. He was not in the same condition as the beginning of the fight either, as he had wounds all over his body, and they were all rather deep. Unfortunately, none of them were fatal, as even if the sword pierced his body, it was not enough to hinder him. He was a real freak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Again! We can hold out until he dies,” Lu Yin barked. With Wendy Yushan’s innate gift, he was perfectly healthy, not to mention the fact that Wendy Yushan was being defended by Lu Yin and his Fatesand, which gave her opportunities to heal herself as well. Thus, neither of them had any injuries. Compared to Nightking Gu, the two of them were just tired.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under such circumstances, Lu Yin was fully confident of stalling Nightking Gu until he died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Bro, charge, go for a mutual exchange!” the Ghost Monkey shrieked, as he was feeling strangely hot-blooded. Defeating the expert ranked fifteenth was just too enticing of a prospect. Although Lu Yin could not rely on this battle to enter the top twenty, he would at least firmly enter the top sixty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was also excited. “We’ll behead him today!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan raised her sword and was about to attack, but then they heard a whoosh as sword qi swept over towards them from a distance. It was not aimed at Nightking Gu, but rather at Lu Yin and Wendy Yushan. The two hurriedly retreated as the sword qi attack had nearly succeeded in taking them by surprise. They looked over to see that a figure with a long sword had appeared. The blue, seven-lined battle force shrouding the figure was astounding. Long Yun had returned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The appearance of Long Yun caused the expressions on Wendy Yushan and Lu Yin’s faces to change drastically. Nightking Gu alone had pushed them to the point of exhaustion while trying to deal with him, and if Long Yun joined the fray now, then they might not be able to last even with the defense of Lu Yin’s Fatesand. The Fatesand was too small, so it could not protect them on every side.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Forget it. We can’t defend this place any longer,” Wendy Yushan spoke softly. Long Yun’s appearance had dashed their hopes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun coming here meant that they had failed to protect this mountain range, as even a fool could see that Long Yun had come here to help Nightking Gu. The Daynight clan and Sword Sect had finally united.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Over on top of the mountain range, Northgate Lie sighed. In the end, they would need to hand over the mountain range. Fortunately, they had mined a considerable amount of pyrolyte, so even if they handed most of it over to the Sea King's Dome, the remainder would still be enough for him to face his family with pride.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Above the planet, Nightqueen Qiuyu’s face was ugly. If at all possible, she would rather not split the profits with the Sword Sect, but just Nightking Gu alone had not been enough to seize the area. Thus, they had been forced to find another ally. Long Yun was way weaker than Nightking Gu, but he could still qualify as an ally.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone had assumed that the matter was settled. No matter how heaven-defying Lu Yin’s powers were, he should not be able to withstand the alliance of two super experts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin clenched his fists, as victory had been inches away, but the other side had made a comeback in a single move. This sort of loss was depressing, as those great powers from the Innerverse were circling about him like pythons, slowly suffocating him to death. And now, they were able to team up however they wished and toy with him as if he were a nobody. What meaning was there in his battles up to this moment? They had simply dispatched two experts and easily crushed him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Sea King's Dome had plotted against him, he had persisted up to this moment, even against the major powers. Being suppressed in this fashion made him feel like he was being choked, and he even felt like he was being driven crazy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin could not take it anymore, as what did the various great powers think they were? A casual decision from them was enough to turn all of his hard work into trash. He did not want to be a grieving nobody who could be threatened at every turn. Wendy Yushan’s pale and weary face reminded him of the helpless Great Yu Empire, which could similarly be easily toyed with. He wanted to resist these forces, even though he knew that it was not wise. The Sea King's Dome would not blame him if he retreated in this situation, but he did not want to let others force him into making a decision. He wanted to resist, even if just for this one time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan looked at Lu Yin with worry, as she could sense his unwillingness, as his body was literally trembling with fury. “You don’t want to give up?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin did not reply, and he looked towards Nightking Gu and Long Yun before looking up. It was almost as if he could see the gathered organizations and the smug expressions on Nightqueen Qiuyu, Elder <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span>, and the others.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you don’t want to give up, then I’ll help you,” Wendy Yushan told him quietly, but her eyes became determined as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin placed a hand on her shoulder. “There’s no need. I can do this on my own.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan was astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin raised his foot and stepped forward. As he passed Wendy Yushan, he tossed her a Money Bomb. “This thing can instantly kill a Hunter, so it should be enough for you to protect yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, under countless lost, shocked, and puzzled eyes, he walked by himself over towards Nightking Gu and Long Yun.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless felt that his actions were strange, and many thought that he had gone mad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On top of the mountain range, Hai Qiqi frowned, and a trace of worry appeared in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lily Anne could not help herself, and she shouted, “Brother Lu, it’s enough! You’ve done enough!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Off in the distance, Nightqueen Yanqing and the others made their appearance, though they were also puzzled by Lu Yin’s actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On another side, those from the Sword Sect also appeared: Mu Rong, Liu Shaoqiu, and Yōu Ye'er. At this moment, everyone was watching Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Ren looked appreciatively at Lu Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin stopped a hundred meters away from Nightking Gu. “This battle isn’t over.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin then donned his universal armor as a gun appeared in his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sight was very strange, because the higher a cultivator’s realm was, the more unlikely it was for them to use things like a set of universal armor or ring armor. Not only did such items not provide much in the way of defense, but they also obstructed one’s mobility. This was also the reason why nobody had donned ring armor since the start of the battles on Planet Pyrolyte. A battle technique could strike the body even through armor, so the protection provided by one was not very impressive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the gun, that bewildered people even more, as such an object was too ancient. For example, Nightqueen Qiuyu herself had not seen a gun in many years, so it took her some time to even recognize what that item was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun felt that something was off, and Nightking Gu squinted, but he then charged ferociously towards Lu Yin. The Nightking struck out with a palm, as no matter what this Limiteer did, it would not be enough to defend against his attack, and making a move also would not harm him in any way. If Lu Yin acted, then Long Yun would also make a move.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan subconsciously raised her sword as she readied herself to help.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Gu’s punch solidly struck Lu Yin’s universal armor, and everyone was stunned to see that Lu Yin did not use his Fatesand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a loud explosion, but Nightking Gu’s punch made no impact on the universal armor. He had assumed that his punch would either be blocked by Lu YIn’s Fatesand or send this person flying. However, no one, including him, expected that the attack would do absolutely nothing to Lu Yin. Lu Yin then calmly raised the gun and pointed it at Nightking Gu’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Planet Pyrolyte fell silent, and everyone stared blankly at Lu Yin and Nightking Gu. In the area around the Nightking’s heart, fresh blood poured out in copious amounts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless people were stunned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun narrowed his eyes, and he stared at the scene with overwhelmed emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin spun the gun and pointed it at Nightking Gu’s forehead. Just as he was about to pull the trigger for a second time, Nightking Gu’s body twisted as he sped away, large amounts of blood falling to the ground behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin did not fire and only silently watched the man leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one knew what was going on, as one gunshot had pierced through Nightking Gu’s heart. This gun possessed an extraordinary power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could a gun be so powerful? After all, Lu Yin’s opponent had been Nightking Gu, a super powerhouse who could use the Nightking’s Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If this gun was pointed at Planet Pyrolyte, then it could definitely pierce through the entire sphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was currently rejoicing that he had purchased this gun, as each attack had a power level of roughly 80,000. Nightking Gu was strong, and he certainly surpassed the average Cruiser. However, an attack with a power level of 80,000 launched at close-range in an unprepared situation was definitely enough to severely injure him. If he had not quickly escaped, then the second shot would have caused his head to explode.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan stared at Lu Yin as if he was incomprehensible. It turned out that he actually still had such a powerful trump card up his sleeves.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;In these few years, what exactly have you gone through?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyu found the scene to be unbelievable, as someone had actually relied on a foreign object to severely injure a Daynight expert. They were the Daynight clan! They had unlimited resources. Before Nightking Gu had gone down to Planet Pyrolyte, Nightqueen Qiuyu had offered him some external aides, but the youth had declined. She had not insisted, but the final outcome was so ironic.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Limiteer was able to severely injure the fifteenth ranked expert of the younger generation, and an item powerful enough to cause this much damage was rare even within the entire universe. How had this kid gotten one? Was it the Sea King once again? Perhaps that powerhouse had given Lu Yin Fatesand as well as many other objects that could preserve his life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the base of the mountain range, Nightking Gu covered the area around his heart as his skeletal-like body withered even further. He stopped at a distance and looked at Lu Yin with caution in his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin was astonished, as that shot had actually pierced through the Nightking’s heart, but the man had still managed to survive somehow. Lu Yin’s eyes filled with star energy, and he was able to see that Nightking Gu’s rune lines had been reduced by a great deal. The man had truly been severely injured, but it was unfortunate that his heart had not been destroyed, as that mighty shot had only brushed past his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he thought about it, Lu Yin raised the gun and aimed it at Long Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Yun felt his scalp tingle, and he instantly backed a thousand meters away as he vigilantly observed Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin did not fire, as these experts were now prepared, which meant that a bullet with a power level of 80,000 might no longer cause them much of an injury, or they might even be able to evade the attack entirely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He paused, turned the gun around, and aimed it at Nightking Gu again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Gu appeared fearful, and he quickly retreated just like Long Yun. Not only did he retreat, but he even began considering escaping since he had been severely injured, and he would be in trouble if he did not leave. However, he was also afraid Lu Yin would fire at him, so he did not want to show his back to Lu Yin. Fortunately, at that moment, he saw the spacecraft that had crashed at the same time as his, though the person inside had never appeared, which was probably because they were too terrified.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Gu kept his eyes on Lu Yin as he backed away step by step until he was in front of the spacecraft. He then tried to pry open the hatch with one hand so that he could use the vessel to escape into outer space.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin kept the muzzle of the gun trained on Nightking Gu the entire time. Even though he had no intention of firing the weapon since the attack would not be powerful enough to kill him, the Nightking still kept a cautious eye on Lu Yin. Once he managed to force the hatch open, he threw the occupant at Lu Yin like a rock without even looking at who it was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin moved a few meters to the side when he saw the body flying towards him, but he also kept his eyes on Nightking Gu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Gu had already taken the spacecraft over and was speeding back into outer space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin relaxed, as the strongest enemy had left, and Long Yun was not Wendy Yushan’s opponent alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Above the planet, the majority were watching Lu Yin and Long Yun. Only the Ross Empire, Blaze Realm, and Dire Barbarian Clan were staring at <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Sleeping Prince</span> whom Nightking Gu had just thrown out of the spacecraft, and Huo Houye was furious that this scoundrel was still sleeping at this moment. “Is that guy actually useful?”&nbsp;</span></p>
