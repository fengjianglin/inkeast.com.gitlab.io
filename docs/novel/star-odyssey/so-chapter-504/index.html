The self-proclaimed Lord Pisces had assumed that an alliance of all the Limiteers would be able to deal with Mu Rong and that they could all divide up the pyrolyte ore this way. However, such a belief was simply laughable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had already achieved his objectives, but the outcome would not be controlled by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Xiaoyun was the first to strike, and an endless sword rain descended from the sky upon everyone on the mountain range. From the very start of the battle, the Sword Sect had decided to treat everyone else as their enemy. Regardless of whether or not Lord Pisces unified them, the battle would not have changed in any way.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they faced the Sword Sect’s powerful attack, many cultivators retaliated. In an instant, the mountain range and the ground surrounding it ruptured while the void distorted as spatial cracks spread out in a lightning-like fashion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Gang and the rest stared at the scene, dumbfounded. This was a true top-tier battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, Xi Yue and Wen Qian'er were also shocked because Mu Rong and Ling Que had also both acted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the second time that the two had exchanged blows on Planet Pyrolyte. Ling Que immediately split into three Ling Ques that combined their three blades into one that struck out towards Mu Rong. On the ground, a field of green grass extended in all directions as the shepherd boy’s song could be heard. The three Que's Mighty Slashes froze in the void, but in the next moment, Zhanlong Daynight and Nightqueen Yanqing moved as one to attack Mu Rong as well. Liu Shaoqiu raised his blade, and light appeared around it as the cold glint of a single sword illuminated Planet Pyrolyte.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This top-tier battlefield was not one that commoners could participate in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lord Pisces watched on blankly, as he had assumed that he could gain control of the situation by allying with the crowd to stand up to the Sword Sect. But when the battle truly started, his scheme seemed laughable. He realized that, even without his schemes, the battle would still have proceeded in the exact same manner as everyone would still have automatically worked together to resist the Sword Sect since Mu Rong was too powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scale of this current battle greatly surpassed the one for control of Pyrolyte Mountain. Not only were the strongest Limiteers such as Mu Rong involved, but there were also quite a few of the elder generation’s Explorers who had reduced their cultivation in order to participate in the battles on this planet. There were not just one or two who were able to fight on the battlefield of Mu Rong and Ling Que, but nearly ten. They came from the Daynight clan, the Wen family, or the Sword Sect, and one even released a powerful beast, indicating that they were from the Divine Grade Hall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If these elders were not able to defeat Mu Rong, then this mountain range would never be able to be seized; this was the crowd’s mutual understanding.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the space above the planet, the various major powers stared at the mountain range. This might be the most important battle during this period of contending for pyrolyte ore on this planet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like shooting stars, countless spacecraft descended onto the planet as more Limiteers appeared to join the fray.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The aftershocks were strong enough to send hundreds of Limiteers flying, removing their ability to continue fighting.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One shepherd boy's song had taken control of countless people, as it had even nearly caused Lu Yin to harm himself when he first heard the song, let alone other average Limiteers. Mu Rong’s shepherd boy's song had severely injured almost a third of the cultivators present, and the power of his innate gift stunned those watching from outer space.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu looked up, and as his Second Sword descended, countless blankly stared at it. Was it really a smart move to become enemies with the Sword Sect? This was not a battle that they could make any contributions to, even if they all allied together.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lord Pisces gritted his teeth and attacked Liu Shaoqiu. Two strange fish formed a strange pattern that attempted to suppress Liu Shaoqiu, but the young swordsman simply sliced them apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re past your prime.” Then, Liu Shaoqiu’s Second Sword swept past him, and Lord Pisces spat out a mouthful of blood as he crashed heavily into the mountain range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight appeared from behind Lord Pisces and aimed both fists towards Liu Shaoqiu, who raised his sword in defense, but his body was still sent crashing into the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu had also slashed out at Nightqueen Yanqing, who used her Nightking body to block it. Her purple eyes looked at everyone from the Sword Sect, but the surroundings suddenly changed. This was Yōu Ye'er’s Encompassing Lockdown Array, and she stared at Nightqueen Yanqing with cold eyes. She then looked to the right and innocently batted her eyes. “Old auntie, let’s play again!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing started raging. “Stupid brat, I’m going to kill you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, a strange ripple traveled across the battlefield. Both Nightqueen Yanqing and Yōu Ye'er were astonished by this ripple. This feeling… was a domain?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old auntie, who do you want to kill?” Hai Qiqi’s voice called out as she appeared on Nightqueen Yanqing’s left side, coincidentally situated opposite Yōu Ye'er.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yōu Ye'er looked at Hai Qiqi, and Hai Qiqi stared at Yōu Ye'er. It seemed that there was some sort of mutual feeling between them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing’s rage had surpassed anger, and she exploded out with her entire strength, but even then, she wasn’t able to shake off Yōu Ye'er’s Encompassing Lockdown Array.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi was curious. “What a powerful battle technique. What is it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yōu Ye'er was pleased by the attention. “It’s the Yōu Court’s battle technique, Encompassing Lockdown Array. Isn’t it awesome?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi nodded incessantly, and then excitedly said, “It’s very powerful. Teach me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had already forgotten her awkwardness due to the Sea King plotting against Lu Yin and had returned to her normal behavior in the blink of an eye.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yōu Ye'er readily agreed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing fiercely bellowed. What did these two stupid brats take her as?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that point, the void tore open as a Que's Mighty Slash arrived, piercing through the Encompassing Lockdown Array and rescuing Nightqueen Yanqing.</span></p>

This scoundrel had the ability to interfere in their scuffle even while battling with Mu Rong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que was already facing tremendous pressure from Mu Rong and had incessantly widened the scope of their battle in an attempt to avoid being controlled by the shepherd boy's song. He had no choice but to stop and save Nightqueen Yanqing, but Mu Rong made use of that opportunity to sweep past three powerhouses who had reduced their cultivation. The shepherd boy leading the cattle then crushed the entire battlefield, and caused almost ten of the former Explorer experts to spit out mouthfuls of blood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong was too terrifying, as he was still able to retain his unparalleled status despite being surrounded by numerous experts, of which included Ling Que.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing was fixated on slaughtering Yōu Ye'er and Hai Qiqi, so after being rescued, she became more careful so as to not be captured by Yōu Ye'er’s Encompassing Lockdown Array again. Every time Yōu Ye'er moved, Nightqueen Yanqing would change locations at extreme speed, and then she would use her powerful star energy to attack Yōu Ye'er.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yōu Ye'er cried out, hurriedly escaped, and Hai Qiqi called out to her. “Follow me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yōu Ye'er immediately went to the other girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing’s hatred for Hai Qiqi even surpassed what she felt for Yōu Ye'er. She chased after the two of them while ignoring everyone else, and she ended up charging towards the mountain range.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most of the Limiteers around the mountain range had been severely injured by Liu Xiaoyun and Liu Shaoqiu’s sword techniques. Only a minority of them still had the ability to move, and they decided not to participate in the battle, as the people taking action at this moment were too scary.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing’s power was absolutely formidable. As long as she maintained her vigilance, Yōu Ye'er’s battle technique would be ineffective against her, and Hai Qiqi’s domain was also not a match for her power. The two girls were being chased by Nightqueen Yanqing, and they soon arrived at Northgate Gang’s position.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northgate Gang was stunned, but he had already known that something was amiss when Hai Qiqi had excitedly charged out. Sure enough, she had provoked a terrible enemy into chasing her back. Everyone could feel the steeply mounting pressure as they faced Nightqueen Yanqing, but they could not withstand it at all, so they looked towards Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi screamed, “Save us! This old auntie is killing people!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yōu Ye'er also shouted, “Somebody save us!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing’s eyes released a cold killing intent. Even if this girl was the Yōu Court’s princess, she had decided to kill these two girls before answering to anyone, as the Nightking clan was not afraid of anyone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi pulled Yōu Ye'er over next to Lu Yin, but then she suddenly stopped moving. “We’re safe.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yōu Ye'er blinked. “Why?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing raised her hand and grabbed at the two girls, completely ignoring Lu Yin as she did not even glance at him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the moment she streaked past Lu Yin, she felt her scalp turn numb as a shiver ran down her spine. With her many years of battle experience, she was able to instinctively sense danger, and she tried to twist away from her location, but a hand firmly grasped her shoulder. “Nightqueen Yanqing, it’s been a while.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words caused her pupils to constrict to pinpoints, and she turned around with a blank face to look at the person who had just spoken. She looked at Lu Yin, and he then nodded before altering his appearance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing felt lost, as she recognized the person who was holding onto her. He was the same person who had used two fingers to trap the Que’s Mighty Slash, which had indirectly saved her life. She had always been looking for this person, but she never expected to meet him at this place. Still, why was his voice so familiar? Could it be…?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next moment, Lu Yin’s looks changed back to his original appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing’s eyelids had dropped so much that her eyes were nothing more than slits. She cried out in disbelief, “Lu- Lu Yin?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not even a meter away from them, Hai Qiqi patted her chest as Yōu Ye'er also stared in shock at Lu Yin.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All this time, I’ve been indebted to your care,” Lu Yin quietly replied. He was already in a bad mood since he was being forced to participate in this contest for pyrolyte despite not gaining anything at all from his actions, and he was even expecting to be forced to flee to the Cosmic Sea afterwards. To him, his fate had already become a tragedy, and whoever appeared in front of him right now could only be considered unlucky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Yanqing felt an intense pain shoot out her shoulder as a boundless strength passed through her shoulder and into her organs. A fresh line of blood flowed down from her mouth. “Lu Yin, how dare you appear here! Aren’t you afraid that Frostwave Weave will be targeted?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes turned cold. “That’s right, everyone will definitely try to take advantage of me. However, from now on, this threat won’t work on me anymore. Pass this message on to Elder Yuanjing for me: I, Lu Yin, will forever remember his care.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He then flung her away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had been thoroughly suppressed by his strength, and she was not able to resist at all as her entire body was sent crashing into the mountain range like a cannonball. With a boom, she was smashed underground. Her Nightking’s Body disappeared, and her battle force collapsed, as she had instantly lost consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was frightened by Nightqueen Yanqing’s devastating defeat, and everyone turned to look at the mountain range. There was someone there who could defeat her in such a manner?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Que also looked at the mountain range in shock.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Nightqueen Yanqing was not a top-tier elite, she was still qualified to be one of the experts who had surrounded and targeted Mu Rong. In fact, she could be considered as one of the five most powerful people in the present battle. But despite that, she had been beaten so badly in an instant just now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">High above the planet, Nightqueen Qiuyu’s body trembled as she stared at the scene. “It’s actually him! This junior’s looking to die! He actually dares to make a move against my Daynight clan! Contact <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Karthika</span> and get him to immediately destroy the Great Yu Empire!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Sword Sect’s spacecraft, Elder <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Viletree</span> frowned. “Is that Lu Yin? Why is he here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the Wen family’s vessel, Mira also stared at the scene in shock. Why had Lu Yin been so foolish as to attack the Daynight clan? He should have stayed out of this mess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the Second Grade Hall, <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Karthika</span> clenched his fists. Lu Yin had still shown up, and he had actually attacked the Daynight clan at that! Wasn’t this kid afraid of dragging Frostwave Weave down along with him? Or did he really think that Hai Dashao’s promise would be enough to keep it safe? As long as the Sea King himself didn’t make any promises, they wouldn’t care since this brat was messing with their bottomline.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From Northline Flowzone, Granny Chan and the rest were pleasantly surprised. Did Lu Yin want to help them seize the mountain range? But why? The situation was changing way too quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The various powers were all focused on Lu Yin now. Mu Rong had previously demanded their attention, but now, Lu Yin was the greatest obstacle standing in front of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the base of the mountain range on Planet Pyrolyte, everyone looked towards Lu Yin. They were not unfamiliar with this person, as he was the strongest Limiteer, someone who had surpassed Mu Rong. He was the true unequalled powerhouse within their realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Rong and the rest stopped fighting while Liu Shaoqiu and Zhanlong Daynight emerged from underground, also having stopped fighting. Lord Pisces’ face turned a deathly white as he looked up. There was another junior who was even more ferocious?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s appearance had changed the situation once again. He was not afraid of being surrounded, and since he had decided to make his move, he would no longer remain cautious. He would teach these people a lesson and show them what an unequaled Limiteer actually was.</span></p>
