If he was lucky, one of these two rolls would be either Timestop or Enhance. If not, he’d have to wait for quite a while before making another attempt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, luck was not on his side. For both times, he rolled Pilfer. He obtained a weapon that looked pretty good, but on his second roll, he received a normal pair of pants. In a fit of anger, Lu Yin burned the damn thing to ashes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d already rolled his die four times, but his luck had been terrible. He could only wait ten days and hope that nothing would go wrong before he rolled his die again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the Astral Wilderness, a flaming warship was headed in the direction of Frostwave Weave. It carried cultivators from the Blaze Realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the contest for the pyrolyte ore, the Blaze Realm had only obtained a small amount of pyrolyte. The main reason was because Lu Yin had killed Jared, which meant that the Blaze Realm had been significantly slowed. On top of that, one of the people they had intended to deploy had never shown up, and Huo Houye had been absolutely furious because of that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only when everything was over that that person had arrived.</span></p>

She was beautiful but very vicious. More importantly, she was ranked thirty first in the Top 100 Rankings. Unfortunately, by the time she arrived at Planet Pyrolyte, Lu Yin and the others had already left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Lilyrose</span> was lazily leaning against the side of the spacecraft, revealing a pair of long, pale legs. She stared off into space. “Things have changed and going back to the Innerverse is now impossible. I wonder if there are any fun people still here in the Outerverse.” As she spoke, Huo Houye came to her mind, and she smirked. “Wendy Yushan will probably disappear from the Top 100 Rankings soon. That means that I’ll be able to enter the top thirty. What a pity. Lu Yin’s a pretty interesting guy though. I hope that he doesn’t die in some pathetic manner.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Baihe?” Someone exclaimed in shock. <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Lilyrose</span> turned around and saw a young man with fair skin and burning excitement in his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s me! Do you remember me? You’re the one who took me to the Blaze Realm!” The youth ran over to her, looking at her zealously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Lilyrose</span> blinked, pursed her lips, and gave off an incredibly enchanting look. “Is that so?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth could feel his heart rate rapidly increase because of her alluring figure, and he gulped. “There were a thousand of us at that time, so it makes sense that you wouldn’t remember me. Where have you been all these years? You haven’t been to the Blaze Realm at all.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Lilyrose</span> chuckled and lifted the youth’s chin with a finger, much to his shock. She then slowly drew closer. “I’m very tired, my dear, so let me lean on you for a bit, okay?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man had a dazed look as he gulped, and unconsciously scanned the woman’s body. He could sense an enchanting aroma from her curvaceous body, and her bright red coat looked incredibly beautiful. The young man found himself unable to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Lilyrose</span> smiled and leaned forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth felt something warm, and he was enveloped by an indescribable sense of amazement as he unconsciously placed his arms around <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Lilyrose</span>’s slender waist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the border of Frostwave Weave, there was a fleet patrolling. Everything appeared to be normal, but then, all of a sudden, flames spread everywhere and burnt the whole fleet to nothingness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A figure flitted by and stared ahead fiercely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On Zenyu Star, Lu Yin eyed the various documents in front of him and felt a headache developing. He had no idea how Undying Yushan had managed everything. The Great Yu Empire was huge and covered thirteen filaments, so there were innumerable incidents and reports coming in at any given time. Right now, chaos reigned throughout most of Frostwave Weave. There was a whole mountain of documents making their way to Lu Yin every single day.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had already re-delegated most of the documents to others, but even then, there were still many that he had to personally handle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could not find Wendy Yushan at this time either. This must have come from her previous experience. She must have known that this would happen, so she had left him at Zenyu Star while she escaped.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin sighed and started to read another one of the documents. Lu Yin had to decide whether or not the military should suppress rebels on a certain planet. All he needed to do was approve the military action. The next document was about sending more supplies to some region, but just thinking about the work still ahead of him made him dizzy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He really couldn’t take it anymore. If he spent all his time looking at these documents, there was no way he would be able to do anything else. This wouldn’t do. He needed to find someone else to handle these things.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, all of the Great Yu Empire’s ministers were people who Undying Yushan had hired while he had still been around, and most of them were people whom Lu Yin disliked. The way that they’d treated <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Karthika</span>, in particular, had been unacceptable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s time to reevaluate things and find someone talented to deal with all this bureaucracy,” Lu Yin muttered to himself. Then, he dived right into the huge pile of documents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of a sudden, his gadget beeped. Lu Yin glanced at it, and his expression immediately changed. He immediately contacted Ban Jiu and activated Zenyu Star’s defenses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin took a step and next appeared in the sky. Soon after, Huo Qingshan, Peach, Rocky Auna, and the rest appeared as well, all of them looking up at the sky with a grim expression. They’d all received the same report. All of the fleets patrolling along the path between Northcastle Weave and Frostwave Weave had been wiped out and destroyed by flames. The line was pointing straight at Zenyu Star.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The situation that they were most worried about had finally come to pass. A powerhouse was attacking Frostwave Weave, and they had already dealt a huge amount of damage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moving the people who lived on Zenyu Star to somewhere else wasn’t possible at this moment. If their opponent was an Enlighter, then they’d move very quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin looked grim as he rubbed his cosmic ring. It seemed that there was no way to get out of this mess. The powerhouse might very well be an Enlighter, since they had attacked with flames, there was a high likelihood that they were that Enlighter from Blaze Realm, Huo Houye.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan appeared, and she looked at Lu Yin solemnly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, Ban Jiu arrived as well. Invisible energy waves enveloped Zenyu Star, also covering all three of its surrounding rings. This was Zenyu Star’s strongest defense that had been created back when Undying Yushan was still in power. It was rumored to be able to block the attacks of a peak Hunter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Based on the feedback regarding power level, it would seem that the enemy isn’t too far away from Zenyu Star at this time,” Ban Jiu said grimly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zenyu Star was prepared for battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hours later, the energy surrounding Zenyu Star turned completely red as a terrifying pressure spread out and started to roast the entire planet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people on Zenyu Star trembled in fear as the temperature of the entire atmosphere spiked. Even the oceans started to evaporate..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Houye towered above the planet in outer space and looked down at it. With a wave of his hand, his flames turned into a gigantic palm that smashed down. After a boom, the three continents started to collapse, and the defensive energy field had already been destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin had preemptively put on his universal armor, and he took out the Money Bomb at this time and aimed it at Huo Houye. At the same time, Huo Qingshan, the Blind Monk, and the other powerhouses all attacked. Numerous attacks were aimed at the Enlighter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Houye snickered. “I’ll show you what being an Enlighter means.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With one hand, he manipulated the void and caused ripples to quickly burst open and swallow all of their attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the universe’s space had changed, Enlighters were still able to tear through the void. This was the ability held by the strong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, all of the devices measuring power levels exploded, for Huo Houye had displayed an incomparable strength just now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Yu Empire had never provoked an Enlighter before. Even Liuying Zishan, Peach, and the others had never faced such a powerful cultivator. The pressure that they felt from this person was something that they did not even have the guts to face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Money Bomb attack that Lu Yin had used on Huo Houye proved to be completely useless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Houye took a step forward and appeared in front of Lu Yin and the rest. With a wave of his hand, flames blazed through the void. Huo Qingshan and the Blind Monk, who were both Hunters, immediately rushed forward to stop him, but they were unable to advance at all due to the flames. Lu Yin stood in front of them and looked at Huo Houye as a jade talisman appeared in his hands. If he crushed it, Mister Mu would appear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wait a second.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Lu Yin suddenly recalled the fact that the Innerverse and the Outerverse were no longer connected. Could Mister Mu even come?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thought caused him to go pale. If Mister Mu could not come, then Lu Yin’s only option would be to contact Granny Chan from Northline Flowzone. After all, Northline Flowzone still owed him a favor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Houye looked at Lu Yin with scorn. “Weren’t you arrogant at Planet Pyrolyte, kid? You killed a powerhouse from my Blaze Realm, chased away the people from the Daynight clan and Sword Sect, and even fought against people in the Top 100 Rankings. What about now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s eyes glimmered, and he looked uncertain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan spoke up. “You want the secret technique, don’t you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Houye looked straight at her, his eyes revealing his desire and greed. “Yes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll go with you under the condition that you don’t hurt anyone. Otherwise, I’ll just kill myself, and then you’ll never be able to get it,” Wendy Yushan said matter-of-factly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin grabbed her. “No.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Peach and the others voiced their disapproval as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan pushed Lu Yin aside and kept her eyes trained on Huo Houye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Houye appeared to be deep in thought for a moment. Compared to a secret technique, these people’s lives meant nothing to him. He was also afraid that something would go wrong while capturing Wendy Yushan, so he agreed. “Fine, I’ll do it. I won’t harm the others, so obediently come with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy Yushan looked despondent as she glanced over at Lu Yin. “Take care of yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s resolve hardened, and just as he was about to crush the jade stone, Hai Qiqi appeared after having hid for several days. She looked straight at Huo Houye. “Have you forgotten that Frostwave Weave is under the Sea King’s Dome’s protection?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Houye chuckled and shook his head. “I know that you’re his daughter, but now that the Innerverse and Outerverse have been completely separated, he can’t meddle in the affairs of Frostwave Weave anymore. Besides, even if this wasn’t a problem, the Sea King has already offended the entire Innerverse by stealing all of that pyrolyte. The Sea King is in trouble as it is. I’ll disregard your rudeness seeing as how I already have the secret technique. You may go.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi looked up. “The Sea King is a man of his word. If he says that the Frostwave Weave is under his protection, then he won’t allow anyone to do as they wish!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blue rays started emanating from her body as an item appeared in her hands; it was the Sea King’s Trident.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin’s pupils shrank as he recognized the weapon. However, what was in Hai Qiqi’s hands was clearly not the actual Sea King’s Trident, but rather more like its shadow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment the weapon appeared, everyone on Zenyu Star was able to sense an incomparable strength that was far above Huo Houye’s. This power was able to nullify the heat that had enveloped Zenyu Star.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Houye eyed the spear in awe. “This… this is the power of the Sea King.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Qiqi lifted it. “Leave or die.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without giving the matter a second thought, Huo Houye immediately left. He had been able to sense a threat to his life. That thing most certainly held the Sea King’s power. He hadn’t expected the Sea King to actually be able to merge his power into another person’s body—that power was enough to kill an Enlighter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sometimes, the longer people lived, the more they feared death. That was precisely the case for Huo Houye. It didn’t matter whether or not Hai Qiqi truly had the ability to kill Enlighters, as he wouldn’t take that risk.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yin put the jade talisman away and stared at Hai Qiqi in awe. It was no wonder why the Sea King had said that Hai Qiqi did not need Lu Yin’s protection. Clearly, she had the power of the Sea King within her all along. No, didn’t she say that she couldn’t sense the Sea King’s power before? Could the reason why she had been able to sense his power be because of what her father had placed in her body?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that case, this power was all there was, and it could not be replenished anymore. He hurriedly had Hai Qiqi stop using it.</span></p>
