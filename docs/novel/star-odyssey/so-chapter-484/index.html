No one could tell if it was deliberate, but this time, Liu Shaoqiu’s attack also affected Nightqueen Yanqing; his attack had managed to land on both Zhanlong Daynight and Nightqueen Yanqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kuang Wang had been slightly off to the side, so he had not been included in the area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ground within the battlefield’s range kept sinking, and the bodies of the cultivators who had previously died on Pyrolyte Mountain were reduced to dust.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight was very smart, and she had not retreated very far. Due to the state of her body, she was incapable of retreating, so instead, she decided to dive deep underground without looking back. The moment she felt the powerful force sweep over her, she had already charged into the magma, hiding deep underground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She kept going until she could no longer feel any pressure from the battle on the surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Violent winds blew about, and the scenery around Pyrolyte Mountain changed once again. The ground had sunk down by dozens of meters for miles around the mountain, making the mountain appear even taller than before. High in the sky, Liu Shaoqiu and Zhanlong Daynight faced each other, each of them huffing and puffing as they eyed the other.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Zhanlong Daynight showed no external signs of injuries, he was obviously much weaker than before. The luster that had previously covered his body and represented his regenerative abilities had vanished; he’d overdrawn his Daynight Restoration Technique.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was different from when Lu Yin had defeated him on Shenwu Continent. Lu Yin had been markedly stronger than him, and had defeated Zhanlong Daynight by landing a blow that the Daynight Restoration Technique could not handle. Liu Shaoqiu’s Fourth Sword had directly clashed against the Daynight Restoration Technique, so this battle was more about who would fall from exhaustion first.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A victor had yet to be determined, but there was already someone in trouble: Nightqueen Yanqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu’s Fourth Sword had covered a large area. He had intentionally attacked Nightqueen Yanqing alongside, using her as a sacrifice for his attacks. Her Nightking’s Body had been severely damaged, and she had collapsed onto the ground, gravely injured.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight clenched his fists and glared at Liu Shaoqiu. He was confident that he could still win, since even though he had overdrawn the Daynight Restoration Technique, he would return to peak condition very soon. Everything would be fine as long as he managed to recover before Liu Shaoqiu used the Fourth Sword again. That attack definitely was not one that could be easily used, or else Liu Shaoqiu would be invincible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu clenched the hilt of his sword. The regenerative abilities of his opponent were monstrous, and he was starting to develop a headache because of it. It was unthinkable that the Fourth Sword hadn’t defeated this person. Did Liu Shaoqiu have to risk it all and attempt to use the Fifth Sword? He had only vaguely comprehended the Fifth Sword, and he hadn’t yet fully mastered it. However, in the worst-case scenario, he would have no choice but to try it out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of a sudden, Zhanlong Daynight glared at Nightqueen Yanqing. There was a whole crowd rushing towards her led by the Sword Sect’s Yan Hua. They were clearly targeting her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the previous battle between the Daynight clan and the Sword Sect, Yan Hua’s opponent had been Zhanlong Daynight. The Daynight clan member hadn’t gone all out, and Yan Hua had merely suffered light injuries that were much less severe than Liu Xiaoyun’s. This was why he was currently still capable of attacking, and he had taken advantage of this to head straight for Nightqueen Yanqing, his bloodlust clear as day.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhanlong Daynight’s expression changed. He had no idea if Yan Hua and the others would actually kill her, and while he detested the woman, he couldn’t let her die right in front of him. Otherwise, the Nightking clan definitely would not let him off the hook. There was no way Zhenwu of the Ten Arbiters would let such a thing slide.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With no other choice, Zhanlong Daynight was forced to give up on his battle with Liu Shaoqiu, fleeing after grabbing Nightqueen Yanqing. When faced with Liu Shaoqiu and the other experts of the Sword Sect, and after the Daynight clan and the Second Grade Hall had suffered grievous casualties, there was nothing that Zhanlong Daynight could do on his own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Hua and the rest stood on the barren land and watched as Zhanlong Daynight fled with Nightqueen Yanqing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu slowly descended, looking displeased with the results. He hadn’t been able to actually defeat Zhanlong Daynight. That person’s regenerative abilities were far too tenacious, and it was impossible to determine who would have been victorious in their battle until the very end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shaoqiu.” Yan Hua walked over and looked him up and down. “Are you hurt?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu shook his head. “How is she doing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xiaoyun gathered all the pyrolyte ore that we’ve collected and has returned to space. Her injuries are more serious, so she’ll need to stay out of the fight for now and recover,” Yan Hua answered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not far behind him, an inquisitive pair of eyes looked at Liu Shaoqiu, appearing shocked. It was Yōu Ye'er.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu’s eyes swept past the disciples from the Sword Sect and eventually landed on the young girl. His attention on her couldn’t be helped. Although the disciples from the Sword Sect were all charismatic, Yōu Ye'er was different.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sword Sect had an arranged marriage agreement with the Yōu family, and the couple had been designated to be Liu Shaoqiu and Yōu Ye'er. However, this was the first time the two had met, and Liu Shaoqiu had no idea what his betrothed looked like. Confused, he asked, “Why’s there a kid here?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yōu Ye'er knitted her brows together, obviously irritated by his question. She tore off her cloak and yelled back, “You’re the kid! I’m Yōu Ye'er, you hear me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu looked at Yan Hua, his eyes revealing his confusion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Hua attempted to explain, saying, “Have you forgotten about your arranged marriage with the Yōu family?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Shaoqiu’s eyes lit up as he continued to look at Yōu Ye'er. He remembered now. The moment he had inherited the Thirteen Swords, the Sword Sect had arranged for his wedding with someone. He had heard that he was engaged to the princess of the Yōu family, but… wasn’t she rather young?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, what’s with that look! What are you trying to say? Are you looking down on me?” The girl planted her hands on her hips and glared at Liu Shaoqiu in dissatisfaction. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In front of others, Yōu Ye'er would be quite polite. However, she wouldn’t be courteous to Liu Shaoqiu. She couldn’t help herself as she didn’t want to marry him, so she was trying to give him a bad impression so that he would cancel the wedding.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, she’d overthought the entire situation. Aside from the Thirteen Swords and Lu Yin, nothing else occupied Liu Shaoqiu’s brain. He didn’t even try to talk to her, as he simply turned to face Pyrolyte Mountain. “Let’s start mining pyrolyte. From now on, all of this belongs to the Sword Sect.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Hua waved his hand, and the disciples from the Sword Sect immediately took out their devices and started collecting pyrolyte.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yōu Ye'er gritted her teeth in frustration. She had a tense expression while she wondered what she had to do to get Liu Shaoqiu to cancel the wedding. She really didn’t want to be married away to the Sword Sect. The Yōu Secret Art had to stay within the clan and could not be handed to an outsider, so the moment she married Liu Shaoqiu, the Secret Art would be handed over to someone else. She did not want to lose the technique! She still wanted to travel to the Neoverse and try her luck there; she didn’t want to become someone’s wife and spend the rest of her life raising children.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How many girls were there in the Top 100 Rankings, and how many of the Ten Arbiters were female? That was the level that she was aiming for. She was incredibly eager to fight, and she wanted her name to spread across the universe, just like that woman from the Sword Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Daynight clan had lost the battle for Pyrolyte Mountain, and Liu Shaoqiu had managed to conquer the mountain on his own. The Thirteen Swords had defeated the combined efforts of the Daynight clan and Second Grade Hall. The results of this battle naturally caused a huge commotion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Thirteen Swords had once again proven its power, and many felt a chill crawl down their spines.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightqueen Qiuyu was absolutely fuming, but there was nothing that she could do about the situation. She could tell that Zhanlong Daynight hadn’t lost the fight with Liu Shaoqiu, but due to Nightqueen Yanqing, he had been forced to give up the mountain. He could not be blamed for his actions. In fact, if anyone could be said to be at fault, it would be Yanqing for being too weak, or rather, too benevolent. If she had killed everyone from the Sword Sect during the previous battle, the situation would have ended very differently.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Above the planet, in the Sword Sect’s spacecraft, Liu Xiaoyun looked away and sighed.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sword Sect did not bother chasing after Kuang Wang, Zhuo Daynight, and the few other cultivators who had survived. The defeated had been allowed to leave in peace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuo Daynight had suffered serious injuries, and she should have returned to space to recover, but she hadn’t. She knew that, the moment she returned to her clan, she would not receive aid and treatment, but rather reprimands and punishment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nightking Yuanjing may look kind, but he was actually extremely ruthless and cared nothing for Zhuo’s survival. She would rather treat her injuries in a hidden area of the planet, or… &nbsp;wait to die. Perhaps death was a good option. Unfortunately, that would also mean that she would not be able to undo the Sealed Cage Technique and save them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While dragging her injured body forward, she left bloodstains everywhere she went. She finally laid down in a cave surrounded only by a desolate and withered landscape. She took out some of Shamrock Enterprises’ most potent drugs from her cosmic ring and began treating herself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon enough, she lost consciousness due to blood loss.&nbsp;</span></p>

Right now, there was nobody there. and there were no incoming spacecraft either. Everybody had hidden themselves. Zenyu Star was like a caged bird currently, and there was nobody on the streets. Everybody could sense how much power <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Karthika</span> held over their lives.</span></p>

Everyone was only allowed to stay within their homes, and no one was permitted to leave. Any incoming spacecraft was not allowed to approach, and nobody from Zenyu Star was able to leave. He was behaving like an absolute tyrant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rules even applied to Huo Qingshan and the others.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even with the upgraded Money Bombs, he still wouldn’t be able to hurt an Enlighter. Also, his universal armor wouldn’t be able to fend off an Enlighter’s attacks. When faced with such a powerful person, Lu Yin was just like Huo Qingshan: there was absolutely nothing that he could do.&nbsp;</span></p>

A hint of bloodlust flashed before disappearing, but it was soon replaced by fear. He wanted to take care of what he knew would become a huge problem, but Lu Yin’s identity as the Sea King’s future son-in-law was something that he had to take into account. With this identity, even monsters like those from the Divine Grade Hall who had a battle power of several hundreds of thousands would not dare to touch Lu Yin, let alone <span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style="font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;">Karthika</span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

The moment Lu Yin landed, Huo Qingshan and others all realized that he had arrived. They stood up, tore through the void, and vanished.</span></p>

Not too far away, Huo Qingshan, Ban Jiu, and quite a few Explorers stood by quietly.&nbsp;</span></p>

The amount of strength that Lu Yin had just displayed was simply ridiculous. Lu Yin was merely a Limiteer, but Ban Jiu had a feeling that he wouldn’t be able to win, even though he was a Cruiser.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ban Jiu wasn’t alone in his shock. The gathered Explorers were stunned to see just how powerful the Royal Regent had become. Even within the entire Great Yu Empire, there were few people who could contend with the regent.&nbsp;</span></p>

This was his combat intuition born from years of experience. Was the Royal Regent really able to threaten him already? That shouldn’t be possible!</span></p>
