 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Fuyao had really left her own opponent to him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This ghostly cultivator was at the third tier of the Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea. It was indeed easier for Qin Fuyao to defeat him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, with Qin Fuyao at the front, Wu Yu at the back, and Luo Pin in the sky, that ghostly cultivator clearly knew that he could not escape. So he accepted his fate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“An eighth tier Jindan Dao cultivator wants to fight with me?” The ghostly cultivator felt that this was a joke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But how had Wu Yu defeated his companion within such a short time?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could tell that the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff was an outstanding supreme immortal treasure with one look!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is alright if I die here today, I will drag a Yan Huang Immortal Soldier down with me!” The ghostly cultivator grinned maliciously. At this moment, strong winds blew and his black robes fluttered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His third tier Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea's Violet Kingdom Primordial Energy unfolded, forming a great pressure enveloping Wu Yu. In an instant, it was like he was dragging Wu Yu into hell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ten Thousand Floating Ghosts Harpoon!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A supreme immortal treasure appeared in his hands with a wave. That was a black harpoon, cold and evil. Upon closer inspection, this supreme immortal treasure was covered with countless tiny faces. The expressions were all twisted and vicious. It was as though they were cooked in a pot of oil and burnt with strong fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over 10,000 faces formed this Ten Thousand Floating Ghosts Harpoon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This supreme immortal treasure could actually just barely defend against the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff. Its power was comparable; it was no weaker than Gu Xuan’s Ivory Bone Barb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Battles with ghostly cultivators were usually very simple and straightforward. ghostly cultivators trained in the evil arts. A battle between a martial cultivator and a ghostly cultivator was usually a battle to the death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, outside of the Shushan Immortal Sect, the martial cultivators of the divine continent hated and despised ghostly cultivators much more than demons. Because the most terrifying and disgusting deeds were usually done by ghostly cultivators. It was a living hell on the Four Islands of the East Sun, where most of them resided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Seven Eyes Demon Absolute Change.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After controlling thet Ten Thousand Floating Ghosts Harpoon, black smoke erupted from the ghostly cultivator. That smoke increased suddenly and swallowed everything. In this process, the ghostly cultivator’s body was changing too. In an instant, he became a six-zhang-tall giant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dark purple scales covered his body. Bloody red spurs stretched out from his fingers, elbows, knees, and spine. The most terrifying change was on his face. He looked monstrous and had seven large, saucer-sized eyes covering his ugly face. Each eye glowed with green light, and there were white shadows waving like ghosts within them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even that Ten Thousand Floating Ghosts Harpoon in his hand became much larger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hou!” After transformation, all seven eyes of the Seven Eyes Demon locked onto Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the eyes’ gaze fell on him, it was like he was in hell. It reminded Wu Yu of the Demon Eye Speothos. This ghostly cultivator before him had used a Great Dao Mystique and performed a similar immortality art!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kill!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he looked into those eyes, Wu Yu could feel a spirit's evil power burrowing into his own eyes. He quickly closed his eyes and used Visualizing the Inner Ape to maintain a clear head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was not an easy opponent. Wu Yu knew that clearly. He needed to defeat him fiercely with an explosive stance. The longer this battle dragged on, the more dangerous it would be!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides, Qin Fuyao and Luo Pin were looking at him. Before these two great beauties, especially when one of them was a dragon, he would be ashamed if he was defeated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My good younger brother, make your move quickly and let Sister see if you are really strong.” As expected, Qin Fuyao giggled. Her flirtatious laughter tugged at his heart and actually helped Wu Yu recover from the influence of that Seven Eyes Demon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Immortal Ape Transformation!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu suddenly changed and became a tough golden ape in front of the two beauties. This time, he was wearing the Yan Huang Immortal Armor, which would change with his body. After Wu Yu transformed into the golden immortal ape, the majestic and overbearing Yan Huang Immortal Armor continued to wrap his body. At this moment, he wielded the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff and was bathed with golden flames. He was indeed resembling that Great Sage, Heaven's Equal more and more!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s good to be a man. They can transform into smelly monkeys without care. If I had turned into this monkey, I would have scared myself.” Ming Long was envious yet disdainful at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Wu Yu was not smelly at all. That naturally dominating aura, aura of contempt, and that fierce fire burning in his pair of eyes exploded with an intensely strong spiritual willpower!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The instant he completed the transformation into the immortal ape, the Seven Eyes Demon and Wu Yu clashed. Both of them seemed to want to fight in close range. They caused the heavens and earth to shake. Their great strength caused large forests to twist and tear before the battle. Bits and pieces of wood flew in the sky!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hong long long!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the first time the two of them had fought with the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff and Ten Thousand Floating Ghosts Harpoon. Instantly, they caused violent quakes. Even the ground sunk, causing large areas of collapse. Even Yunxi City was greatly affected from afar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A roar erupted from Yunxi City. Over 10,000 women were anticipating and nervously watching this final showdown between Wu Yu and the Seven Eyes Demon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I remember who he is now. He was originally a disciple from Shushan. I heard that even the Ursae Sword Immortal was prepared to take him as a disciple, and he was rumoured to be in a relationship with the Mizar Sword Immortal’s daughter. However, because of his relationship with the son of Ying Huang, he was expelled from Shushan. I did not think that he would join the Yan Huang Imperial City so quickly and even become a centurion...” Muxue Yunxi finally remembered Wu Yu’s identity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She obviously knew that other than the legendary Wu Yu, there was no other eighth tier Jindan Dao cultivator who could be that terrifying!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people remembered him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He was just chased out of Shushan. Is it good for him to join the Yan Huang Imperial City so quickly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t know, but many people will see this as being shameless... After all, this way, he will be suspected of being a traitor who lies to his master and destroys his ancestors. But I spoke to him just now and I feel that this young man is very sincere and responsible. No matter what anyone says, he is helping us now,” Muxue Yunxi said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Someone else said, “But didn’t he have a good relationship with that Nangong Wei? Why is he with that Qin Fuyao when he just joined Yan Huang Imperial City?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Muxue Yunxi said, “Don’t spread rumors. It is just a coincidence that they took the same mission.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was Wu Yu’s first time fighting against a third tier Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator. He indeed experienced the unparalleled Violet Kingdom Primordial Energy of his opponent. When it came to a clash between internal strength, Wu Yu was losing out by too much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the first clash, if not for the Yan Huang Immortal Armor, he would have been injured. Even though he was now hit as well. He crashed to the ground and almost caused the ground to collapse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That Seven Eyes Demon screamed angrily again, and those seven eyes shone with piercing green light. Holding the Ten Thousand Floating Ghosts Harpoon, he pierced towards Wu Yu again. The places touched by the light from those eyes dissolved into green liquid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu quickly got up. He had tested the waters and now he knew what to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He held the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff with both hands and waited for the Seven Eyes Demon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He activated the Unshackled Doppelganger and 10 doppelgangers appeared in front of Wu Yu, each holding an immortal treasure longsword.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">10 waves of sword qi started their attack again. This was the direction where Wu Yu defeated the ghostly cultivator before. These 10 doppelgangers instantly scattered around the Seven Eyes Demon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the cover of the Xuan Immortal Spirit Petrifying Sword Technique, Wu Yu used all his Jindan essence and activated the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff's spirit design. Those 10 doppelgangers suddenly made their attack together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yan Emperor Heaven-Splitting Design!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his angry roar, the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff's spirit design worked furiously and flames were instantly ignited. Countless gold flames soared into the air. Wu Yu held the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff up, activating its spirit design. He waved it violently and swept towards his opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Emperor Heaven-Splitting Design's true essence was in this sweep!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Huang Emperor Earth-Shattering Design's true essence was in this smash!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, the staff dao's most fundamental basics were just these two moves. A sweep and a smash!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the Heaven-Splitting Design, he would use one sweep to split the heavens. The Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff's rage was burning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, the Seven Eyes Demon was being attacked by the Xuan Immortal Spirit Petrifying Sword Technique. It was precisely when he was feeling a piercing pain in his head that he was struck with the Yan Emperor Heaven-Splitting Design!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his big right arm, he blocked Wu Yu's attack. Immediately, amidst the raging golden flames, only that right arm was directly blown to pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, Wu Yu’s Jindan essence was far less powerful than his opponent’s, so even the Yan Emperor Heaven-Splitting Design did not completely defeat his opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And this strike even angered the Seven Eyes Demon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His opponent roared and the Ten Thousand Floating Ghosts Harpoon attacked towards him again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, in the next moment, before he was hit, Wu Yu attacked again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Violent Art!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, during the Immortal Ape Transformation, his arms suddenly became thicker and his physical strength doubled!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Wu Yu now, wearing the Yan Huang Immortal Armor, was like a mad demon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huang Emperor Earth-Shattering Design!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The glistening light and golden brilliance coming from the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff were dazzling. If the golden light exploded, it would swallow up everything within hundreds of miles; it would even swallow the whole Yunxi City in golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The martial cultivators in Yunxi City could no longer watch the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And the Seven Eyes Demon was naturally swallowed and trapped in that golden world of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, Wu Yu smashed down with his staff. Even if his opponent had the Ten Thousand Floating Ghosts Harpoon to defend himself, he would still be smashed into pieces!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a cry of pain, the Seven Eyes Demon fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, the golden light disappeared. People saw that the Seven Eyes Demon had returned to his ghostly cultivator state. He was covered in blood and was battered to a pulp. He was obviously badly injured and almost dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And Wu Yu was still in the state of a violent golden ape. He landed next to his opponent. When the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff landed on the ground, the earth trembled momentarily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After using the Violent Art, he felt weak, but he continued to steady himself. He was afraid that this ghostly cultivator would commit suicide!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he was still too slow!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he descended, that ghostly cultivator gave him a cold smile and then his body was instantly swallowed by black flames, leaving behind only black ashes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu really could not understand why these ghostly cultivators could face death so calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But his opponent had committed suicide. He was reaching his limits and released the immortal ape transformation. He had expended a lot of energy in this battle. It was mainly because his Jindan essence was lacking too much compared to his opponent’s Violet Kingdom Primordial Energy. Hence, Wu Yu had basically used all his trump cards to defeat his opponent.</span></p>
