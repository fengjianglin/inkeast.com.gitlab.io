 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Learning the Nascent Yin Yang Single Sword Strike requires one to possess two different kinds of spiritual power. One that is firm and unyielding and one that is soft and accommodating. One yin and one yang!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was what was engraved upon the dao technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just that dual spiritual power requirement made it difficult for anyone to cultivate it. It depended upon one's Qi Condensation Spiritual Art.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most of the Qi Condensation Spiritual Arts that allowed one to produce two types of spiritual power had already been lost to the annals of history.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wu Yu's Great Way of Immortality Art could bridge this gap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Great Way of Immortality Art was developed upon the basis of yin and yang being mutually supportive, and it created two different kinds of spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When it came to the tempering of the fleshly body, Wu Yu possessed the Invincible Vajra Body and was at the Inner Vajra Buddha tier. This brought along with it a tyrannical strength and was at the peak of body refining.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In terms of spiritual power, he possessed an art that harnessed the harmony of yin and yang, allowing him to better understand the great dao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he possessed the necessary foundations to learn this dao technique, Wu Yu was determined to learn it. Even though he no longer wielded a sword, there was a possibility that he could learn this technique successfully. Even if the might of the technique was not strong, so long as they could leave, it would all be worth it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Conversely, even though Lan Shuiyue was a student of the sword, she did not possess two different spiritual powers. And even if she tried, she would not be able to learn it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Shuiyue's Qi Condensation Spiritual Art was the Heavenly Sword Sect's renowned Heavenly Dao Melody. It allowed one to create a spiritual power that was similar to a sword and was extremely tyrannical when used to execute dao techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I want to cultivate the Nascent Yin Yang Single Sword Strike," Wu Yu spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You! I thought you had abandoned the sword." Lan Shuiyue had also taken a look and did not believe that Wu Yu would be able to learn it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If I am able to learn this ancient dao technique, we have a greater likelihood of leaving this place. In that case, do you think I should try or not?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then let me try as well." Lan Shuiyue was also raring to try.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu knew that Lan Shuiyue's efforts would be futile as she did not possess the two spiritual powers necessary for this technique. However, he did not stop her either.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Shuiyue's immortal treasures were the Clearwater Twin Swords. As they were a pair of blades, he borrowed one of them from her to practice the Nascent Yin Yang Single Sword Strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sword was the true emperor of all weapons; it combined the essence of all weapons into it. Wielding the longsword, Wu Yu could feel that his brutality did not harmonize well with this weapon's elegance. The Demon Subduing Staff was truly the most fitting immortal treasure for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this did not mean that he would be worse than anyone else if he were to wield a sword. He had practiced the sword since young, so its movements came as easily as a thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"When the heavens and the earth were created, they separated into yin and yang....&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It includes all that is formless, traceless, and that which cannot be seen. Those that are unborn and those that are born are all unaware. To obey the emperor's rules and shun all evil. All possess influence of the yin yang and the five affinities. In one breath, one shall be reborn!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Xiantian and houtian, yin and yang combine, with the five affinities and congeal into one. Truth does not diverge from what is fake. What is false would also be true. Only with both will there be completeness. One requires the other to exist. Condense all into a breath. Without injury or harm, everything will be perceived with the image of the five affinities. Yin and yang exist harmoniously, a single breath propagates form."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Frankly speaking, this scripture was awkward-sounding and was extremely mysterious and hard to understand. Wu Yu spent a significant amount of time just trying to understand what it meant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it had to be admitted that this Nascent Yin Yang Single Sword Strike definitely possessed some history and strength behind it. As an ancient dao technique, it differed from the dao techniques used now. Most likely in terms of strength, even with Wu Yu being at the third tier of the Qi Condensation Realm, the might of this technique should surpass his Nine Dragons Ascension Column.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was most important was that the Nine Dragons Ascension Column was just an ordinary dao technique. Once Wu Yu condensed his Jindan and possessed Jindan spiritual power, using the Nine Dragons Ascension Column would be like utilizing a wooden sword to hack at someone. At that point, he would need to find himself a proper metal sword, a better dao technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This ancient dao technique might’ve been a wooden sword now, but perhaps in the future, it would transform into a steel sword that Wu Yu could brandish with ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ancient dao techniques were not split into different grades, as their might was dependent on the cultivator himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, most of these dao techniques had been lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even then, there were certain limitations to these dao techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The more Wu Yu pondered, the more he realized that the Nascent Yin Yang Single Sword Strike was extremely mysterious and marvelous. It had a sense of changing the heavens, and when cultivated, it produced an indescribable feeling. The dao techniques of today might’ve been strong, but few could touch upon the understanding of the great dao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had a premonition that even if he successfully cultivated this technique, there would still be a lot to ponder over to fully understand it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu split his spiritual power into yin and yang as he cultivated alongside Lan Shuiyue. Very quickly, he had started to obtain results, but Lan Shuiyue had barely touched upon the technique itself. She only felt that her mind was like paste and she could not understand anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yin and yang in a single breath, weaving through the past and the now."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this small abode, Wu Yu began to practice the technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ten days had already passed, and Lan Shuiyue could only stare blankly at Wu Yu practicing the technique as she made no progress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I am a sword cultivator. Why am I inferior to him?"</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;At this point in time, this was a strong blow to Lan Shuiyue's confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After another 10 days of effort, seeing how engrossed Wu Yu had become, Lan Shuiyue gave up. She began to sulk in a corner and placed all her hopes onto Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I hope that this is the only chance that skeleton provided for us to survive..."</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;she mused as she watched Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the time when he started cultivating, Wu Yu had almost never opened his eyes. He had become fully engrossed into cultivating this ancient dao technique. Lan Shuiyue was feeling extremely lonely and oftentimes wanted to say a few words. Yet as she did not want to distract him, so she kept to herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is the last chance, he must succeed..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One could not tell day from night, and as she waited, she finally fell asleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no spiritual qi here, so her spiritual power gradually dropped. It was possible that she might not be able to hold on if this kept on for much longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his fervor, Wu Yu continued to practice relentlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only now that she began to appreciate how determined Wu Yu was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she also understood the gap between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If I am able to live, this opportunity might be one of the most beautiful that life has given me.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Even if it’s not perfect and not romantic, Wu Yu doesn't hold me in his heart. However, he has also changed me."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at his unwavering expression, Lan Shuiyue couldn't help but to let out a smile. She had finally grown up in the midst of all this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One month passed, then two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three months of time passed in the blink of an eye.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, for the two of them, they had lost track of all sense of time. It could have been ten days and it could have been a year already...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Shuiyue was leaning on a rock. Even though she possessed more spiritual power than Wu Yu, she was unable to keep a grasp on herself, and she found her spiritual power and vision gradually slipping away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the Wu Yu in front of her had seemed to split into multiples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Am I going to die?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Shuiyue couldn't help but to entertain such thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was feeling weaker and weaker as time went by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She could feel the world in front of her eyes become more and more illusory. As she continued to stare at Wu Yu, even he gradually disappeared from her view.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who would have known that I would die here..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Shuiyue gave a bitter smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her willpower was gradually being worn down as her body withered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It looked as though she was about to leave this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, a boom was heard and the entire world around her shook.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"My time has come."</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;She felt that this was the beckoning of the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, she was hoisted up but someone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Have you died?" someone asked her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I thought I had died!" Lan Shuiyue replied slightly agitatedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sure, then we will bury you outside."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thud, thud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All she could hear were footsteps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although it was in the afternoon, the entire Bipo Mountain Range seemed quite melancholic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The number of Heavenly Cloud Rocs and Immortal Cranes looked to have lessened significantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The servants were still idling around, taking care of the Immortal Cranes and the immortal essences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the spiritual qi was boundless, the Bipo Mountain Range seemed as though it was enveloped by a haze, with numerous disciples looking extremely downcast and alarmed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three months ago, something momentous had happened at the Valley of Immortal Fate. Numerous disciples were keen to spread what had happened within.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a 900-year-old demon who had snuck into the Valley of Immortal Fate, and all the disciples who had entered had been killed by it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, that group of individuals included the Heavenly Sword Sect's successors!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ghost-Faced Ape had almost shattered the foundation of the Heavenly Sword Sect. He had done something that demons had never dared to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the Ghost-Faced Ape had been killed by the Sect Leader, and all the demons in the Spirit Banishment Tower had been killed within a day to avenge the fallen, their situation was no less precarious than before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Firstly, the disciples felt indignant and wanted to roam the world to slay more demons and devils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, every disciple had been recalled by the Sect Leader back to the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another piece of news had spread through the sect following that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Valley of Immortal Fate would open to all eligible disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was rumored that the Heavenly Sword Sect would be attacked by the Zhongyuan Dao Sect, as well as the Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts, in order to pillage their resources.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was even scarier was that a demon who had condensed a Yaodan was also leading a veritable army of demons and devils to support those two opponents. This was going to be a three-front fight. It was just a matter of time before the Heavenly Sword Sect would be swallowed whole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One thing was for sure: the Heavenly Sword Sect was willing to rally all their strength to protect themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This news was not verified by anyone, but it raised a furor. Every disciple felt alarmed, and even certain servants had chosen to escape. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the battle had not started, their hearts had already been lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The originally flourishing Heavenly Sword Sect had become bleak and despondent. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there had been a small change today.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was said that the Zhongyuan Dao Sect's Sect Leader, Jiang Xie, had personally come to the sect to speak to Feng Xueya. He had declared that their sect would never cooperate with ghostly cultivators nor devils and demons.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of these false tales were spread by the ghostly cultivators and demons.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Thankfully, all these were lies. If we were to engage in a three-fronted battle, our Heavenly Sword Sect would be doomed!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Numerous disciples were discussing on the Bipo Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yes. It’s lucky that the Zhongyuan Dao Sect is standing on our side."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Everyone is an orthodox cultivator. If we had to cooperate with those ghostly cultivators and demons, that would be truly shameful!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I heard that the Zhongyuan Dao Sect’s Sect Leader brought a group of strong youths to the Immortal's Battle Stage to exchange pointers with our Heavenly Sword Sect disciples. Do you want to go and take a look?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Sect Leader's son, Jiang Junlin, is also there."</span></p>
