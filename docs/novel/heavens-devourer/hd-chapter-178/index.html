 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that instant, the Ninth Spirit's face changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Wu Yu could not see where the golden light had pierced the Ninth Spirit's body, he immediately sensed that the Ninth Spirit's Yaodan had been pierced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And that was why her expression had become so tortured, even twisted. It twisted so badly that even her beautiful face had become ugly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time seemed to stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next moment, what Wu Yu did not expect was for the Ninth Spirit to spew hot flow from her mouth, that rushed into his own. The hot flow was both scalding hot and icy cold. It contained the Ninth Spirit's own fresh blood, and Wu Yu swallowed it all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ninth Spirit's body seemed like it was exploding. The flow of energy flooded forth all at once, almost like she had gagged on something from Wu Yu's body. Now she retched it all out, along with part of herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Wu Yu heard the sound of something shattering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Her Yaodan is broken!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was stunned. He could not believe it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To him, this was a miraculous accident. Even after it happened, he still did not react. As the Yaodan tore, he consumed a portion of the spiritual power; the reversal of the Sky Fox Forging; Jindan Immortality Art. Otherwise, even if the spiritual power dissipated, it would not have rushed into Wu Yu's body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pa!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ninth Spirit's face contorted, and she thrust Wu Yu away from her. She had also lost control of her spiritual power on the Argenti Chain, which fell away from Wu Yu, granting him his freedom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thump, thump!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both fell to the floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu struggled to a cross-legged position. His body had gone crazy. The bursting of her Yaodan had flushed his body with a torrent of spiritual power. This was not a good thing in itself. Although the Sky Fox Forging; Jindan Immortality Art was in play, it was out of the Ninth Spirit's control. It very quickly rampaged through Wu Yu's body. It was the feeling of swallowing dozens of spirit concentration pills at the same time and being unable to expel them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was in danger again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the Ruyi Jingu Bang disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the only consolation was that the Ninth Spirit's situation was worse than Wu Yu's. She had shifted into the Beautiful Fox of the Nine Heavens, and her nine fox tails had curled around herself as she shook. The well of spiritual power within her had formed a vortex that surrounded her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Her Yaodan must have been pierced! Normally, the rupture of the Yaodan is a very serious affair. It might cause one to regress to the Qi Condensation Realm, or even worse! But a portion of her spiritual power has entered my body. Even if she manages to stabilize the chaotic spiritual power, she won't have enough spiritual power to complete her Jindan condensation again!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu immediately realized both of their situations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It must’ve been the Ruyi Jingu Bang that saved me! I will definitely live on!"</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Back when Wan Qing had not killed him, it had allowed him to walk the path of cultivation. This time, he had again narrowly escaped death. His will to live was stronger than anyone else's. And he glared back at the Ninth Spirit, who was in pitiful agony at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long appeared before him, staring mouth agape. "Damn me! It saved you? Why was it quiet as a mouse when Granny died? Not fair! Not fair!!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had given up as well, and the incidents had stunned her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing her maddened state, he could not help laughing. "I know why."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Why?" Ming Long pricked up her ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's because the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal and I are both male. You're female," Wu Yu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Up yours. You dare to look down on women? You almost got done in by a woman." Ming Long rolled her eyes. She was also checking Wu Yu's body. After stealing life from the jaws of death itself, she was also excited. "This is a tricky situation. She used her demon technique to suck out your yang essence to fuse with her yin essence, forming her new spiritual power. And now the Ruyi Jingu Bang forced her to spit out your power, which also dragged hers out. After all, that part had already been fused with yours through the demon technique."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The chaotic energy was naturally not Wu Yu's Immortal Power of the Great Way, but rather formed by the Sky Fox Forging; Jindan Immortality Art. Only half belonged to Wu Yu, and it clashed aggressively with the Immortal Power of the Great Way. It was not under Wu Yu's control, and it was ripping him up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What should I do?" Wu Yu had to ask.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long must have felt like she had let Wu Yu down previously when she had been helpless, and was now forthcoming with the answers. After all, Wu Yu had not yet escaped danger. She said, "The power has entered your body and is trying to conquer it. It's not realistic to expel it; after all, a portion of it belongs to you. Try to use the Great Way of Immortality Art to see if you can use them to fashion spiritual sources, and convert them into Immortal Power of the Great Way."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is a risk, but it's also the only way."</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wu Yu thought this over, and concurred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking over at the Ninth Spirit, the fox demon was consumed by a vortex of power. She was in agony, but would occasionally lift her head to glare balefully at Wu Yu. Evidently, she had not given up, and her hostility was tinged with bloodthirst!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"On the path of cultivation, barring direct contests of strength, victory often favors the calm and the brave."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This dramatic fight for his life was a huge blow to Wu Yu's state of mind, but he very quickly calmed down. After this near-death experience, he understood the meaning of life even better and became even more determined to win this struggle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without question, this would be a bold and torturous process! Even while he condensed spiritual power, he would have to endure the crumbling and tearing of his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luckily, a part of this power belonged to Wu Yu, and he could control it nominally. Otherwise, if it was all Spirit Concentration Pills, his flesh would really have been torn asunder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, his Inner Vajra Buddha had not been fully completed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter what, Wu Yu gritted his teeth and persevered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is a life and death struggle. If I give up and let the Ninth Spirit recover, the one who dies will be me!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Ruyi Jingu Bang has given me this chance. I must seize it!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Freshly back from the gates of hell, Wu Yu's will to live far surpassed the Ninth Spirit's. Even Ming Long was nothing but praise, saying, "You brat. Your endurance surpasses mine tenfold."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within his pain, Wu Yu spluttered a laugh. "Who was it just now who said that she would call me ‘Daddy’ if I survived this time?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long's face paled, then she roared with laughter. "You must have been mistaken. I heard no such thing."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I must be right. Just that the person refuses to acknowledge it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long was quite a lovable character, although she was an avaricious one at times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Do you believe that I will cook you and eat you if you say another word?" She puffed up her chest indignantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was entering a crucial phase, so he ignored her. The Great Way of Immortality Art was truly a gift that none but the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal could have bestowed on him. It did not grant Wu Yu the most almighty of spiritual powers, but the immortality art was unbelievably strong nevertheless. In terms of suppressing other powers, it had surpassed his wildest dreams.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long herself had regretted not having this Great Way of Immortality Art, which would have saved her from death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Given the solid foundations of the Great Way of Immortality Art, Wu Yu's foundations were more robust than anybody else's.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time flowed by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Wu Yu began to deal with the chaotic energy, converting it through his immortality art, he began to feel more and more relaxed as the amount lessened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And when he occasionally opened his eyes to meet the Ninth Spirit's baleful red eyes, he could see that she was giving him a pervasive and lustful look. Although neither spoke, both were locked in a life and death struggle at this time. It was highly possible that whoever first regained mobility could spell doom for the other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ninth Spirit had to stabilize the spiritual power that had spilled after her Yaodan had ruptured. That was even more difficult than Wu Yu's situation, but she was confident that she could still regain her Yaodan if all went well. She would surge forth to the fourth tier of the Jindan Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her eyes had become even wilder than before, especially after glancing at the ice sculpture by her side. Perhaps this was just her faith. After her sister had been deceived by humans, this had been her only pursuit. Only when she had fulfilled the childhood dream of the sisters could she take revenge!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even in her dreams, the Ninth Spirit longed to take a knife to her antagonists.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why her will had not wavered all this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Five days later, she had still not been able to take control of herself, but she could feel that Wu Yu had actually condensed another spiritual source! He had succeeded, and he had used her spiritual power to do it. This stunned the Ninth Spirit. She had never heard of someone being able to convert the spiritual power of others into their own before!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although part of it belonged to him, it had been merged with her own through the Sky Fox Forging; Jindan Immortality Art. But this was still inconceivable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this instant, she saw the composure in Wu Yu's eyes, and felt a tinge of fear. She was recalling Wu Yu's exceptional progress that had constantly outdone himself. He had even killed Tian Yijun. Would she be next?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But even though Wu Yu had surged to the ninth tier of the Qi Condensation Realm, the restless energy within his body had still not let up. As long as it had not been completely purified, Wu Yu could not move, let alone attack. It was as if there was a bomb buried within their bodies that would explode at the slightest movement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ninth Spirit was not aiming to immediately form her Yaodan. She, too, was condensing qi. She was using the chaotic energy to reform a demon essence core. In truth, there was no difference between demon essence cores and spiritual sources, besides that they were in different positions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And when Wu Yu had condensed one spiritual source, she had already stabilized half the energy within her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The struggle continued!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They stared at each other, one calm, the other frenzied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Subsequently, the gap appeared. Wu Yu got faster and faster, far outdoing her speed. After nine days, although he had not completed his 10th spiritual source, at least Wu Yu had completely expended the tumultuous energy within his body and regained mobility. And he was stronger than he had been before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu picked up the Onyx &amp; Pearl Dao Swords and walked towards the Ninth Spirit.</span></p>
