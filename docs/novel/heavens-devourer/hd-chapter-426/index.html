 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, Wu Yu was completely engulfed by the lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From his final struggle, it seemed like he had already given up. He had chosen to deal with it anyhow, and by forcing his way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To everyone present, this course of action was undoubtedly the stupidest. A forced resistance was completely meaningless. If he had surrendered, and preserved some strength, he might have been able to win against Qin Fuyao, and perhaps even enter the top three.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Truly, from the start, Wu Yu was the weakest in the top four.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the Battlefield of Old, the black lightning criss-crossed to form a flower. At the heart of the flower, Wu Yu had completely vanished, drowned in the numerous flashes of lightning. Everyone felt that this battle was basically over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some felt that this was a pity. "Wu Yu is definitely doomed this time. With such grievous injuries, he will need a long time to recover. Poor guy. Having squandered so much cultivation time, he will be in for a humiliation even if he musters the courage to go back to the Shushan Immortal Sect."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some thought it was funny. "This kid is really frightfully stubborn. But it's the work of a fool. He knows he is outclassed - why force the issue? Now he'll be completely broken and lose all his matches."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those like Chen Fuyou from the Shushan Immortal Sect side did not care to even speak. They hugged their stomachs and laughed loudly. It was very cathartic, and they laughed until they gasped for breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This laughter immediately showed just how much hatred these Shushan Immortal Sect people held for Wu Yu....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, they knew what had happened to Wu Yu. This only showed how immature the young disciples of the Shushan Immortal Sect were, and that Yan Huang Imperial City was truly a more suitable place for Wu Yu compared to the Shushan Immortal Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And at this time, the fearsome lightning attack finally ceased. Murong Xu could confirm that Wu Yu had been hit squarely by the black lightning. If he himself had been hit, he would definitely be half dead, let alone Wu Yu. Although the Yan Huang Immortal Armor would block some of it, Murong Xu was sure that Wu Yu would need at least half a year to recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He rushed into the electrifying mess. At this moment, Wu Yu's situation was uncertain. Murong Xu had to wait for General Murong to declare victory before he could thoroughly relax.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Black smoke and dust billowed throughout the web of electricity. Through the black storm, Murong Xu's eyes first landed on the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff. It was plunged into the ground, and it glimmered with a dark and desolate light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And beside the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff, there was a person sitting cross-legged. He was completely cooked by the electricity, and his life force was very weak. Even his features had been disfigured. His hair was completely gone and his body was covered in wounds. Evidently, this was Wu Yu, who could not stand against the power of the Black Hell Lightning of Heaven's Wrath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Wu Yu in this state, Murong Xu breathed a sigh of relief. This result clearly told him that the battle was over, concluded with Wu Yu's devastating loss. And now General Murong had yet to see Wu Yu in this state, or he would probably have announced victory immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Wu Yu in this state, Murong Xu could only laugh.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;"Wu Yu, oh, Wu Yu, why be so hard-headed? If you had saved some energy, you might have been able to enter the top three. I must have helped Fuyao out. She must be grateful to me now."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking of Qin Fuyao's good feelings for him, he became pretty happy. Although he had been quite low-profile, and not many people knew, at least those around him knew that he was seriously chasing Qin Fuyao. Only that she had many pursuers, and it was difficult to understand her attitude at times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Murong Xu folded his arms, then extended them to extinguish all the lightning in the area. As the dust faded, he showed Wu Yu's form to everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not dare to believe his own eyes. He thought he must be seeing wrongly. Unbelievably, the cross-legged person who was completely black suddenly opened his eyes! Those eyes were like two suns shining in the black night. The fiery presence stung Murong Xu's own eyes with their brilliance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's gaze was intense, and not at all like someone who had been grievously wounded!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, something even more unbelievable happened. The blackened Wu Yu suddenly exploded forth, extracting the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff. His entire body roared with golden firelight, and he seemed to glow with golden light. Murong Xu reacted. Too late.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was chatting lightly when they saw Wu Yu's blackened figure emerge amidst the fading dust. Many could not help but taunt Wu Yu for his ignorance and thick-headedness. They jeered that he had thrown away his chance of entering the top three. In that instant, with his life force so weak, it was hard to fathom the golden light making another appearance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Huang Emperor Earth Shattering Design!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The staff bore down on him. As fast as Murong Xu fled, as many electric webs as he threw up, still he was unable to stand against the explosion that was Wu Yu. In that instant, the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff crashed down on him. With a grunt, Murong Xu's fresh blood spattered!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu!" Murong Xu howled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang, bang, bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In close combat, Wu Yu was truly a demon. The Mixed Thunder Daosword in Murong Xu's hand was sent flying in the first instant. Following, Wu Yu unleashed a storm of consecutive attacks that smashed into Murong Xu. The speed was terrifying, and more than 100 blows smashed the bones of Murong Xu's entire body in short order. His eyes wide, he fell limply to the floor. Even now, he could not understand what had happened....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even he could not understand, let alone the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They saw a strange scene unfold. The blackened corpse that was Wu Yu had suddenly exploded into action. His movements had been blisteringly fast, and as he neared, Murong Xu had been completely unable to put up any resistance after losing the initiative. They could clearly see that Wu Yu had completely wrecked Murong Xu's mobility within a short period of time. His attack was solidly delivered, direct blows from Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff on a body that raised the sound of snapping bones, loud and clear for all to hear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">General Murong was even more shocked, his eyelids twitching. If he had not been sitting shocked, he would probably have already gone to intercept him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But as Murong Xu fell, the blackened Wu Yu stood with the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff beside him. His mind was still completely blank as he watched on, mouth agape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was not just him, but everyone around as well. Just as congratulations were starting to be offered to Murong Xu, this had happened. It was a miracle....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, it was not much. Wu Yu had used his Invincible Vajra Body to resist strongly. Although he had indeed been seriously injured from head to toe, and his limbs rent, he had employed the Violent Art one last time to end Murong Xu. Right now, his wounds were even more severe, and it was very difficult to continue attacking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, from the time that Wu Yu had first acquired the Invincible Vajra Body, he had never been injured this badly before. This was his first time having such a sensation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Being hounded by the Black Hell Lightning of Heaven's Wrath was an experience worse than death itself. A majority of Wu Yu's flesh had been charred, and he would need a long time to heal. But he was standing thanks to his burst of effort. At least he was standing, while it was Murong Xu limp on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Wu Yu had been hit again, he might very well be dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment near death, it was his dao which had allowed him to endure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, the Invincible Vajra Body had naturally been a part of his dao. He had underestimated the Invincible Vajra Body. With this body, even if he and Murong Xu had sustained the same kind of injury, he would be able to crawl up and finish Murong Xu off. This was the advantage of a resilient physical body. The phrase "cannot be killed and cannot be vanquished" was not just a slogan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It sounded easy, but to be able to endure the process of the Black Hell Lightning of Heaven's Wrath was something that made Wu Yu shudder to recall. But if he was given a choice, he would still choose to go through it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because he could not lose this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was not just that he wanted the recognition of the Imperial General, but also because he wanted to affirm his dao, the dao that would not yield or cower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And now, the Black Hell Lightning of Heaven's Wrath had charred huge portions of Wu Yu's flesh, and he was standing on the power of the golden bone and sinew alone. The Invincible Vajra Body was strong enough, and only his outer layer had been seared off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he was standing through sheer willpower. Even though he had won, the shocking pain did not vanish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without a month of healing, he would not recover fully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He pressed on, unsheathing the Chief Emperor Sword and pressing it on Murong Xu's chest. He lifted his head to General Murong. "General, I could kill him right this moment. May I ask, am I the victor of this battle?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This question made millions take a sharp breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">General Murong was also someone who had seen much of the world. He had felt a sense of fear toward Wu Yu's superhuman willpower, but still he was discontent. To see his own precious son beaten, his temper flared, and he gritted his teeth. "Wu Yu, how dare you use such despicable methods."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu replied, "General, I confess I was unable to stand against the Black Hell Lightning of Heaven's Wrath. Through this body and willpower, I held on by force. I held one last burst of strength for the counterattack, and took him down. How is that despicable?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">General Murong was speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was true, Wu Yu had fought fair from the start. Even though Murong Xu had let his guard down at the last moment, that was his fault in a fight. In the vicious world of cultivation, who would fight you fairly?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the side, General Gu urged, "Murong, the outcome is clear. Announce the winner before we are all made fools of."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So many were watching the Trial of Yan, and General Murong clearly could not be biased. No matter how bitter he felt, he could only wave a hand, saying, "Wu Yu has won this battle. You will fight with Luo Pin for first place in two days, while Murong Xu and Qin Fuyao will fight for third place."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A tone of finality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had miraculously defeated Murong Xu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was shocked at the grotesque, black figure. It was hard to believe. He was clearly human, yet what human would have such frightening willpower?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were very clear about how Wu Yu had achieved his victory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Through his physical defenses, through his tenacity, and through his battle smarts. More terrifying was his willpower, which had truly intimidated all who bore witness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His character, and his dao - those were even scarier than his true ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With this, who would dare to say that he was not fit to be in the top three?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At least it was confirmed that the Imperial General's promise would come true.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over at the Shushan Immortal Sect side, even the Crimson Shadow Sword Sage took a few steps back, his face black. Truthfully, he wanted to rush up and cut Wu Yu down and end things once and for all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking back, his son and the youngsters of Shushan were all staring at Wu Yu, their eyes full of fear.</span></p>
