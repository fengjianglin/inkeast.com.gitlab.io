 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Jiu Ying executed his Natural Mystique, even the miniature Ghost Isolation Array was suppressed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Initially, bloody mist shrouded the space within the miniature Ghost Isolation Array, which almost completely masked Wu Yu's senses. However, the moment the Spiral of Disaster appeared, negative energy swept across. Wu Yu's vision was occupied by that grey and savage-looking vortex. Intense, eerie, and savage deathly aura, chilling aura, and anger gushed out of that vortex incessantly. It was as though the vortex was sucking all the spiritual qi in the heavens and earth and turning it into these eerie and dark energies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying was indeed a terrifying demon with an evil bloodline.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, what he was doing right now was a good deed. If he could save tens of millions of cultivators, he would have done a great service to mankind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Spiral of Disaster swept across, enlarging and shaking off the dull atmosphere. In an instant, the surroundings of Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain were corroded and impacted by at least nine different forms of negative energies. Jiu Ying expended all his effort, intending to pull Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain into the Spiral of Disaster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the only way to truly injure Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain wasn't a pushover. Six black, savage-looking and identical flags appeared in six of his arms at this moment. He let out a growl and started waving the six flags. His Jindan essence was plentiful, and black flames emerged from the six flags. Not only did the flames surround and protect Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain, they also pushed the Spiral of Disaster back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I have the Soul Capturing Flames of the Ghost Mountain. You can forget about using your Natural Mystique to defeat me. Oh, young demon, the strength of your Natural Mystique has truly exceeded my expectations!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While being held in a stalemate with Jiu Ying, black flames gushed out from the six flags and entered Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain’s body. This allowed him to form thick layers of flames around his body. At this moment, he was just like the devil god of hell. While struggling frantically, he was able to grow his body and crawl out of the Spiral of Disaster despite its suction force!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once he managed to crawl out, Jiu Ying's all-out attack would undoubtedly end up in failure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain had already started to laugh hysterically. While he was doing so, Jiu Ying was looking as pale as a sheet. His arms were shivering a little, and he clearly wouldn't be able to maintain his Natural Mystique for longer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Stop your futile attempts, brats! I have planned for at least 10 years for today. How could two ungrown brats possibly foil my plans?" said Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain cockily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of this were clear to Jiu Ying and Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Wu Yu had used the Immortal Ape Transformation with the Violent Art. His preparations were complete and the explosive strength he harbored was unprecedented! In his body, bountiful Jindan essence raged on. It was especially so for his physical body, which had reached the pinnacle of strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Columns combined into one golden rod of the Nine Dragons Ascension Column, the various spirit designs on it started running frantically under the acceleration of his Jindan essence. This allowed Wu Yu to become one with the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Columns!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Weng!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu looked for the best opportunity. When Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain laughed hysterically, he charged between the nine heads of Jiu Ying and appeared above the head of Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain instantly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he had used the Immortal Ape Transformation, he was only as big as one of Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain’s arms. Therefore, it was natural that he didn't draw much attention.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Nine-Directional World Shatterer!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, almost all the spirit designs engraved in the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column shimmered and combined into a huge and awe-inspiring spirit design!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“World Shatterer” had the meaning of breaking and destroying worlds.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu held on to one end of the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column tightly. The other end enlarged rapidly and weighed over a thousand jin. Amidst his own roar, Wu Yu descended from above and ripped everything apart. In fact, he even broke through the black flames protecting Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain and smashed his body with a weighty strike.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the other party had not dodged to the side a little, the Nine-Directional World Shatterer attack would have landed directly on his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though it only landed on the shoulder, the gruesome strike was unparalleled. It was a simple action, but it demonstrated the true meaning of a fast and accurate blow. It was especially so in the perfect use of the Nine-Directional World Shatterer Design. When Wu Yu made contact with the body of Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain, he then released all the power of World Shatter at once!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pa!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain’s shoulder exploded and an arm flew out. At the same time, cracks surfaced on his body. With the shoulder as the center, a large patch of bloody clots appeared!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain had not expected Wu Yu to be capable of making an attack with such power. Therefore, he wrenched in extreme pain and was shocked by Wu Yu's attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wu Yu felt his muscles aching after using the Violent Art, and it was unlikely he would recover in a short amount of time. As this concerned life and death, he couldn't care about others at this moment. Together with Nine-Directional World Shatterer, Wu Yu was confident that even He Taozi might not be able to take this attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strongest effect of this attack lay in the fact that Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain was attempting to crawl out of the Spiral of Disaster when Wu Yu rushed out and hit him from above. When the horrifying blow ripped apart one of Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain’s arms, the impact also sent him crashing into the Spiral of Disaster!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was something that even Jiu Ying had not expected!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he noticed the Spiral of Disaster completely covering Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain, thrill replaced his surprise instantly. He immediately compressed the vortex, and this black vortex instantly turned into a rotating black ball that had Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain completely trapped inside.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the second stage of his Natural Mystique. As long as he could drag his opponent into the vortex, he would then be able to turn it into this huge, rotating ball. Amidst the bloody mist, the large grey ball rotated at great speed that seemed capable of ripping apart the surrounding space.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Crush!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying flew in circles around that huge, grey ball while injecting different spiritual arts into it. As for the grey ball that was rotating at high speed, it compressed at a pace visible to the naked eye. One could also vaguely hear Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain’s screams coming from within!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu finally understood the real killing principle behind Jiu Ying's Natural Mystique. Only by devouring the enemy in the Spiral of Disaster could he then utilize the powers of disasters to crush his opponents into powder.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Will Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain die?" After a single strike using the Violent Art, Wu Yu was close to his limit. His muscles were aching and his body was feeling weak. Temporarily, he wouldn't be of any help.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain died, it would be because of the joint effort of Wu Yu and Jiu Ying. Clearly, if it was only Jiu Ying, Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain would have crawled out of the Spiral of Disaster by now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu naturally hated this ghostly cultivator. He looked coldly and intensely at that huge, grey ball. His heart was in his throat while waiting for the huge ball to compress to a single point, completely killing the ghostly cultivator.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was also revenge for He Taozi and the rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he underestimated the strength of Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain. Just as Jiu Ying was expending all his energy, the grey ball exploded. A ray of blood-red light flew across Wu Yu's vision and disappeared within the miniature Ghost Isolation Array.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He got away!" Wu Yu gritted his teeth. They were so close to finishing him off and refused to just accept the outcome.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luckily, the other party was clearly injured. Otherwise, he wouldn't have fled and would instead have killed Wu Yu and Jiu Ying before they could escape.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying panted heavily and said, "Our collaboration was beyond his expectations. He has definitely suffered significant injuries. However, ghostly cultivators are all very cunning. We are still trapped within the miniature Ghost Isolation Array. If he recovers, we will definitely be dead. Moreover, having trapped us here, he could just ignore us and go kill and massacre cities directly while setting up his real Ghost Isolation Array."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu tried his best to keep himself calm. He knew that Soul Hall would take some time to arrive, even if they learned that Shushan disciples had died. Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain had clearly planned for it. Therefore, it would be hard for him to rely on them. Only Jiu Ying and him were left in the vicinity. Therefore, he could only rely on himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There are still over ten thousand cultivators. Although I have nothing to do with their lives... they are still lives after all. I can't let him massacre the innocent. It is especially so considering his brutal methods. If I can't stop such evil things from happening, what's the purpose of me taking up cultivation?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had a heroic heart. Even though he was in this rather selfish cultivation world, he had not changed his initial thoughts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The most pressing thing right now is to get out of this miniature Ghost Isolation Array." Wu Yu and Jiu Ying had similar thoughts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How shall we do it?" The issue was that Wu Yu knew nothing about spirit design at this moment. Time was working against them. No one knew how long Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain had spent researching spirit designs. In fact, it might even be over 200 years. These were experiences over a long period of time. Wu Yu was able to injure him, but it would be hard for him to have similar expertise in spirit designs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The nine heads of Jiu Ying said in unison, "Demons are wary of spirit designs of martial cultivators and therefore we have a little experience with destroying them. Based on our experiences, all spirit designs have a design base and a design eye. Moreover, most of these are built on the ground. If Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain has fled, his miniature Ghost Isolation Array will lack variation. In that case, we don't have to care so much and just have to smash the ground. The more we smash, the higher the chances we might happen to destroy the spirit design."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This method is a little silly, but it was simple and violent. For two people who had no experience with spirit designs, this was probably the only thing they could do.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright, let's get started quickly. We can't let Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain recover and return to claim our lives."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu landed on the ground Controlling his Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column, he separated them into nine parts and started smashing around on the ground. He did not remain at one spot but instead smashed as he moved. All he knew was that he wouldn't be able to get out by just randomly walking around. Therefore, he might as well destroy everything in his path.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain wasn't around, the spirit design lacked variation. This was also why smashing around would work. After all, the real boundary of this miniature Ghost Isolation Array wouldn't be very big; it would at most cover the area of the ten piles of corpses from before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a tough job. However, the two young men did not lament. Jiu Ying even used all his heads, claws, wings, and tail at the same time and was more ruthless in deconstructing the design.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had not expected a demon to be so concerned about this matter. The truth was that he knew that Jiu Ying had the opportunity to get away and keep himself from sinking into this hot mess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He also wouldn't have to risk his life to fight Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he was pondering, Jiu Ying remarked, "Wu Yu, it seems like you are hiding a lot from others. Even I was shocked by your previous attack. Just as I thought, a person like you who has such a unique train of thought wouldn't be a simple person. Today's the first time I've ever fought together with another person. Although it is the first time, our teamwork seems to be pretty good. We even managed to catch Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain completely off guard!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they hadn't worked well together, they would probably be two corpses by now.&nbsp;</span></p>
