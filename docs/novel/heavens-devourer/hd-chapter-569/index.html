 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's speed at this instant would determine if he lived or died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, stealing the spoils of the Yan Huang Ancient Country experts was indeed a sour turn in his luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who knew that the Fire Source Crystal Beast King had already been claimed by the people from the Yan Huang Ancient Country?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, since things had turned out this way, Wu Yu did not back down. After stowing away the huge quantities of ancient crystals, he had no intention of handing them over quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, this risky move, and the ambush within the body of the Fire Source Crystal Beast King, had not been easy. He had almost lost his life in order to get this treasure!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu gave the Yan Huang Ancient Country people due regard. For example, Jiang Qijun was someone who could crush him. However, his inner pride and courage did not allow him to falter here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the news of the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord, Wu Yu need only get the word out. What happened next would depend on their elders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they fled, Ming Long asked, "Aren't you afraid they'll be in a rage that you foiled them and set themselves against you? What if they agree not to tell your story to their elders? Or what if their elders treat you as an enemy?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a serious matter!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang City Lord had also hoped that Wu Yu's future would be built within the Yan Huang Ancient Country.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was staunch, saying, "I am only responsible to be the messenger. Once the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord is reincarnated, it is not only the Dong Sheng Divine Continent which will be ravaged. The entire Jambu Realm will not be able to escape him. If there is not a single one amongst so many who sees sense, then the time of the Jambu Realm is up anyway. As for my ambush to take this ancient crystal, that is personal enmity, and not related to the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He saw a bunch of youngsters squabbling over possessions as a personal matter. In the end, whoever got it had nothing to do with the serious matter of the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why he did not have second thoughts about snatching these valuables.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had segregated the two affairs very clearly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Wu Yu fled, the super geniuses of the Yan Huang Ancient Country were enraged!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Catch him!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't let a single one get away!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a trice, the 30 odd people started chasing the 1,000!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, if not for the fact that they were all very fatigued, even 10,000 Wu Yus could not have escaped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had been waiting for this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All was fair in war and all that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As his clones scattered, his true form was only a miniscule speck amongst them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was one aspect of this sea - the currents. Once the currents came to sweep them away, Wu Yu would be safe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why after his 1,000 doppelgangers had broken through the encirclement, they began to look for currents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How does he know the Supreme God Technique of our Yan Huang Ancient Country? Is this person from the Yan Huang Ancient Country? How have we never heard of him before?!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they chased, they continued to pressure Jiang Qijun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Everyone, please focus on catching him. I will explain the details later. If he escapes, all of our efforts will have been for naught!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Catch him first!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, dao treasures filled the skies, and the scene was chaotic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu could feel the tremendous pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His clones were currently dropping at a shocking rate. Even with the Prime Heavenly Lord Supreme God Technique, they could not withstand the onslaught of so many experts, especially the few amongst them who were terrifyingly strong. Even in their fatigued state, a casual attack slew an entire group of them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luckily, he was fast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why there were three or four at most who were chasing his real body. The others had all been lured away by Wu Yu's doppelgangers. They would only return attention to the real Wu Yu when all the clones had been killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A flash of his Eyes of Fire and Gold clearly pinpointed the location of every single pursuer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His luck was pretty good. At least those chasing him for now were not the strongest monsters of the Yan Huang Ancient Country. From their grand attire and noble manner, they seemed to be those from the Yan Huang Ancient Country’s imperial family!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Qijun was amongst them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Qijun's gaze was cold, and potent killing intent was exuding from her! She said, "I advise you to stop immediately! You know what you are in, and you know your own identity! Right now, you are currently pitting yourself against the elite of the Yan Huang Ancient Country!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Trying to play the cream of the crop! You had best think this through. I know who you are and where you are from. Even if you leave the Taigu Immortal Path, you will not escape our pursuit!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was trying to pressure Wu Yu with her status.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Truly, she found it unthinkable. A small fry like Wu Yu - where had he found the balls to do what he had just done?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Since you came from the Dong Sheng Divine Continent, you should know your own identity and status! The Yan Huang Imperial City there is but a humble and rural branch of our Yan Huang Ancient Country! Given your status, you should kneel to any one of us! Today, you actually dare to do this, and snatch our treasure before our very eyes?! If you don't cease, you will drag down your entire Yan Huang Imperial City with you! When the time comes, your imperial city will definitely be a land of corpses when we bring the wrath of the Yan Huang Ancient Country upon you!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Jiang Qijun chased, she continued to harangue him. Her voice carried far, and at least the Yan Huang Ancient Country people around her roughly knew Wu Yu's identity now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He comes from the Demon Sealing Continent? There's a path to the Taigu Immortal Path there? A humble side-city of our Yan Huang Ancient Country? No wonder he knows the Supreme God Technique! But this person is really idiotic. To actually not comprehend our status, the Yan Huang Ancient Country people! Doesn't he know the price of setting himself against us? Does he not want his rural side-city to continue living?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The evil experts of the Yan Huang Ancient Country found this a joke!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such a pathetic person - how did he dare to do such a bold thing?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He can evade the monk, but can he evade the temple?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Little brat! No matter what your status was within that little pond of a city, you have to pay the highest respect to us! We give you your last chance on the basis that you are young and ignorant. As long as you hand over the ancient crystal, we will not seek further trouble with you. But if you do not comply, you and every elder and friend behind you will not be able to escape the wrath of us, the Yan Huang Ancient Country!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After learning Wu Yu's status, they found this amusing. But the more they thought about it, the more ashamed they felt. What was their identity? Their status? Their power?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To be so high above, and to be actually fooled by a country bumpkin. If word of this got out, they would be a colossal laughing stock. The butt of the joke within the entire Jambu Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This made them even more embarrassed and furious. Their eminent status had turned against them. After all, the Yan Huang Ancient Country had claimed the Fire Source Crystal Beast King, and even used up all their Ancient Emperor's Demon Vanquishing Sword Talismans. And yet they had been tricked into this situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had also considered all these threats before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I was indeed born in the Dong Sheng Divine Continent. Yan Huang Imperial City and the Yan Huang Ancient Country are indeed where I belong, and aspire towards. But today, the treasure that I took was entirely dependent on my own resourcefulness and willingness to take the risk! It can be considered a fair and square win. Do you all know that I had been waiting for that moment? While you were fighting the Fire Source Crystal Beast King, I was already swallowed into its belly, and immolated in primal fire? Now that you are threatening me thus, are you trying to pull rank on me? If word of this gets to your elders, it's going to be ugly!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu used his remaining clones to banter as they delayed for time. His righteous words stemmed from a clear conscience that was unfazed by their threats.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing this, they understood what a perilous thing that he had done. While they were fighting, they had not dared to approach the Fire Source Crystal Beast King. While Wu Yu had actually been within its body, enduring the heat for such a long time. How had he done it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This undoubtedly shook them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Wu Yu was still a country bumpkin in their eyes, a small fry unworthy of attention, the matter before them indeed compelled their admiration and frustration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, to threaten the Dong Sheng Divine Continent that Wu Yu was from, they had to inform their elders. If word of what happened today got to their elders, they would indeed be further disgraced. This bunch of people would run all the way to the Dong Sheng Divine Continent just to bully the guard of the Heaven Devouring Evil Residence?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How long before you give up?" someone shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu and his clones shouted as one, "I obviously can't give up! If you all want the treasure, by all means, come chase me fair and square! It belongs to whoever can snatch it! But stop using the threat of the Dong Sheng Divine Continent and the Yan Huang Imperial City. Doing that only causes you experts to lose face and dignity. It shames you, and makes you angry, and makes a farce of the rules. If your elders knew, they would definitely be disappointed in you lot!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He hated those like Jiang Qijun, who would use the Dong Sheng Divine Continent to threaten him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, against so many menaces of the Dong Sheng Divine Continent, all he asked for was a fair fight. The logic was simple. Whoever snatched it, owned it. But status and elders were not part of the fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was alone, yet he had dared to take such a risk. Even after being pressured, he still dared to speak such bold words. These words indeed changed his impression in the eyes of the Yan Huang Ancient Country people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, those that were being taunted only grew more enraged. For example, Jiang Qijun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Very well, then we will not only take the ancient crystal, but also your life! You asked for it! By the rules!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At least she was no longer using the threat of the Dong Sheng Divine Continent, but would answer Wu Yu's challenge to take it fair and square!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Wu Yu was not yet out of danger. In fact, he was in the thick of it. Although his real body had yet to be discovered, the number of clones was dwindling. He would eventually be exposed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The clones elsewhere were being thinned out at speed. The menacing geniuses killed everyone they caught.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this stage, Wu Yu had already mustered up all his courage. Using his fastest speed, he fled. Whether he could be caught or not - that was all up to his luck!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, he fled with the speed born out of fear for his life!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although they no longer threatened the Dong Sheng Divine Continent, they would not let Wu Yu go easily for playing such a trick on them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Currents! Where are the currents!?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, the currents were his only hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He weaved and ducked everywhere. His other doppelgangers had been swept away by the currents already, but his real body had no such luck!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Currents, please appear quickly!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, the currents had yet to come, but Jiang Qijun had already locked on to him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she might not know that this was Wu Yu's true form.</span></p>
