 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial had ended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each major sect leader had their own thoughts. To others, perhaps the end of the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial simply meant the end. However, they knew that it was simply a beginning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following this was about 10 months’ time of preparation. That was the truly important thing and key to the divine continent's survival.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, every sect, the demons, and the Tianyi Race all left in a hurry. Usually, after the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial ended, there would be a period of celebration. As the host, the Shangyuan Dao Sect would plan accommodate to everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But there was no celebration this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed strange to the average person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu, who got the championship and successfully gained the qualifications to enter the Taigu Immortal Path, also followed the rest of his companions from Yan Huang Imperial City back to Yan Huang Imperial City. The Imperial General was not around, so Di Yi's Warship was steered by a few generals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The grand, black warship returned to Yan Huang Imperial City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the black warship, over 10 generals gathered, and Wu Yu was in the center. At this moment, General Golden Imperial spoke first. "Wu Yu, I can tell that something has happened and that it is not as simple as a misunderstanding. Can we know what happened?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were not fools. From the moment the Taixu Sage Master decided to change the rules of Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial, to the moment where all major sects left in a hurry, and the fact that the Imperial General had yet to return, all these details proved that something had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I do not know. After we return, please wait for the Imperial General's news."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the preparations to kill Duomingshan Shengxue and Yu Fuyao of the Heavenly Seas, Wu Yu could not care about them. His current mission was to prepare for the Taigu Immortal Path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On this, the Imperial General, the Taixu Sage Master, and the others would plan and arrange everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The generals also knew that even if Wu Yu knew the truth, it was not for him to say. So they still had to wait for the Imperial General.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a few days, they returned to Yan Huang Imperial City. Now Yan Huang Imperial City was in a bleak situation. While Wu Yu had gotten first place in the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial, many of their people had gone missing. Everyone was busy searching for them, so it was difficult to be excited in this city.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After their return, everyone needed to wait for the Imperial General to come out and explain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial General had probably recovered from his pain and sadness within these few days of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After returning to Yan Huang Imperial City, the generals were summoned by the Imperial General into the City Lord Residence. It was probably to explain to them what had happened. And also to reassure them about the disappearance of the 5,000 people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These things would be handled by the Imperial General, and Wu Yu need not worry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's only mission now was to become stronger within two months - in time for the opening of the Taigu Immortal Path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of which, the Yan Huang City Lord had handed to Wu Yu two important things. These were the Battle God Armor of the Prime Heavenly Emperor and Emperor's Pagoda. The Taixu Sage Master had said that he needed enough strength to enter the Taigu Immortal Path. He had to be at his strongest state possible, and being able to control one more dao treasure was actually equivalent to having one more life-saving measure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, when Wu Yu returned to the Heaven's Equal Camp, he was preparing to form a blood bond with the dao treasures. He now had the experience of controlling the Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean. While it would be very difficult, it was worth a try.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On one hand, he held a golden cloth, and on the other, a pagoda. The level of the Emperor's Pagoda was probably above that of the Battle God Armor of the Prime Heavenly Emperor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two dao treasures made Wu Yu recall the protection and teachings that the Yan Huang City Lord had given him. He was Wu Yu's mentor. He had widened Wu Yu's horizons and introduced him to the wide and grand Jambu Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had made Wu Yu see how large the human realm was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Wu Yu would bring the dao treasures that he had used and enter the Taigu Immortal Path. This was also a type of legacy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was not much time left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he formed blood bonds with these two dao treasures, Wu Yu still had something that he needed to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, about half a year earlier, when he had just reached the third tier of the Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea, he spent the next half year trying to expand his Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea. Between Yan Huang Imperial City's ancient spiritual qi and his own large amount of Inner Sea Essence Pills, he had improved very quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But sometimes, a rise in spiritual understanding was the fastest route to raising one's cultivation level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dao was abstract, yet it existed in reality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The death of the Yan Huang City Lord had caused Wu Yu to sink into a swamp. Many doubts appeared on his route to achieving dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he was not that easy to defeat. His heart was strong and surpassed those of many of his age group. He even had the Inner Ape, who guarded his growth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the last battle of the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial, he defeated every participant spectacularly and got first place. In this final battle, he stood at the peak, exhibiting his strong ability. In reality, this also helped Wu Yu in clear his own doubts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the doubts he had about dao had been dispersed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He saw the route that truly belonged to him, and this strengthened his will to become an immortal. The Yan Huang City Lord had once said that life and death were all fated and everyone would one day die and disappear. At that moment, Wu Yu was greatly impacted by his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luckily, the legacy from the immortal and his overpowering ability allowed him to regain his confidence and even push his current level of spirituality forward into another new peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Normally, one should progress slowly on the path of the great dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But some epiphanies had allowed Wu Yu to progress quickly down this path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The first step to immortality is to throw away life, death, and fate. Many people are wrong. Many people cannot do this, especially those who are stuck in their path of great dao and are at the end of their lifespan."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the same even for the Yan Huang City Lord.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The whole purpose of immortality was to escape from the shackles of death. Wu Yu possessed the legacy of an immortal, so his perception of the world was naturally on a higher level. Until now, he had not met another person with the same aim of achieving immortality, and that was because of a higher level of perception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sometimes, the heart and level of perception could solve many problems.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was not in a hurry to form blood bonds with the dao treasures. He knew that there were more important things to do, and that was to study the dao within his heart. He needed to relook and rethink about the recent changes, to fully understand what had happened and to incorporate these into his Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had many Inner Sea Essence Pills, and he was not afraid of using them up. These Inner Sea Essence Pills were all used to build a wider Inner Sea in his Sea of Breath Meridian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial General visited Wu Yu occasionally. He found out that Wu Yu had not rushed into forming blood bonds with dao treasures but was concentrating on raising his cultivation level. What he saw was how Wu Yu swallowed the Inner Sea Essence Pills at shocking speeds. He was like an endless pit, and he could clearly see Wu Yu's Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea expanding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This time, he profited from misfortune."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Big Brother trusted him so much and even gave him such an important mission. Perhaps he really is the biggest hope for the divine continent now…."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this period of time, every major sects' sect leader gathered at the Yan Huang Ancient Well. Even the two demon kings came. In the face of a threat of total annihilation, humans and demons temporarily buried the hatchet of countless years of hatred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial General only visited Wu Yu occasionally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After one month of continuous studying and purifying, Wu Yu successfully entered the fourth tier of the Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea. He had a rise in cultivation level, and this caused his Violet Kingdom Primordial Energy to increase significantly. His capacity of energy was even larger than that of an average sixth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This way, his group of doppelgangers could continue to rise too. Wu Yu was not worried about the improvement of his doppelgangers. He only needed to provide them with Inner Sea Essence Pills and they could train on their own. The only worry was that they used up too many. Even though Wu Yu now had sufficient Inner Sea Essence Pills, he knew that it was only a matter of time before he would deplete all his pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And he would probably use them all up at the Taigu Immortal Path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was on this Taigu Immortal Path?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The extreme geniuses of the Yan Huang Ancient Region or the mysterious dangers of the Taigu Immortal Path?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu knew very well that that would not be an easy place to explore. Previously, Duomingshan Shengxue had entered it, but he exited quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After reaching the fourth tier of the Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea, his battle power increased significantly and the distance between him and the youths of the divine continent would only become wider. Nangong Wei and Ji Lingshuang had both set him as their goals, but Wu Yu felt that it was unlikely that they could catch up to him unless they had other miraculous experiences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You have stopped for very long in your training of the Invincible Vajra Body. If you do not raise its level, the advantage of your physical body will only decrease. Besides, there are many people who have strong physical bodies in the Jambu Realm. They are not as poor as the Divine Continent. It's a pity that the fourth tier of the Invincible Vajra Body requires materials that cannot be found in the Dong Sheng Divine Continent," Ming Long said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Do they have it at the Taigu Immortal Path?" Wu Yu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Anything can appear in a crazy place like the Taigu Immortal Path. Of course, you might also find nothing. It's all purely based on luck. I'm warning you not to carry any hope. Nothing can be explained in that place. Perhaps you will be in danger upon stepping in. If you react slow, you will be reduced to dust. You don't even have to think about snatching other people's Taigu Immortal Talismans. No one is a fool. The Taigu Immortal Talismans are so important - who would give theirs to you?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long was pessimistic about Wu Yu's journey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu did not care. No matter what she said, he had to go to that place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was just exploring all options of strengthening himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"On the aspect of the two grand mystiques, I have yet to improve. I need to continue to work hard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"For my Invincible Vajra Body, I lack materials.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"As for dao techniques, I have just learnt two Supreme God Techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then all I have left now is these two dao treasures. Which one should I form a blood bond with first?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long replied, "Naturally, it should be this tortoise shell. You have that rod for your offensive dao treasure, so now you need defense. This can give you one more life on the Taigu Immortal Path. The Emperor's Pagoda is too powerful and you might not subdue it at the moment. You can try after entering the Taigu Immortal Path."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was probably impossible for Wu Yu to form blood bonds with these three dao treasures, so if he could only choose one at the moment, he also felt that it should be the Battle God Armor of the Prime Heavenly Emperor. Having two offensive dao treasures might not be good for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After deciding, he made the preparations. He had about one month left, and he needed to control this Battle God Armor of the Prime Heavenly Emperor before the Taigu Immortal Path opened.</span></p>
