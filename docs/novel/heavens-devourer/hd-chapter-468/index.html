 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Below, Beishan Mo and Nangong Wei joined forces to attack and kill. They did not disappoint the Mizar Sword Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the Mizar Sword Immortal who had taught them this method. Both of them had totally opposite attributes. Therefore, when they joined hands, they would repel each other naturally. However, within this repulsion, there were mutual complementation as well. Hence, they could produce an even more terrifying power together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Together, it was almost like there were three of them surrounding and attacking their opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And now they were cooperating with each other in a real battle and displaying quite powerful attacks. This made the Mizar Sword Immortal very satisfied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He and the Ursae Sword Immortal floated and stood in the sky. The Mizar Sword Immortal was still very angry because of the death of the Green Depths Sword Emperor. Now he was secretly instructing the two young disciples that they must not be soft-hearted and find the opportunity to kill Wu Yu completely and take revenge for the Green Depths Sword Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The five of them are training in seclusion in the Reincarnation Realm. I have informed them, but it will take some time for them to arrive," the Ursae Sword Immortal told the Mizar Sword Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Mizar Sword Immortal said, "Today, we must not let Wu Yu leave alive; otherwise, we will let our ancestors down!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were not speaking - they were communicating using their Primordial Spirits. This exchange of messages happened in a flash, which was much faster than the fierce battle happening between Wu Yu and the other two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ursae Sword Immortal said, "Even if the five of them come here, it will not be possible to kill Wu Yu under the protection of the Imperial General. They are even more reluctant to offend Yan Huang Imperial City."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Mizar Sword Immortal angrily said, "How can we let Wu Yu leave safely after he killed our Green Depths Sword Emperor?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Mizar, the Green Depths Sword Emperor has long been dead, leaving only a little spirit remnant in the dao treasure. The times are different now. The old man should live in his glorious age, and not here. Wu Yu does not have the ability to kill our Green Depths Sword Emperor."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ursae Sword Immortal was telling the truth. The Green Depths Sword Emperor did not belong to this era, but in this period of time, he was the mastermind behind the Seven Immortals of Shushan. For example, it was the Green Depths Sword Emperor who had instructed the Seven Immortals of Shushan to accept Beishan Mo as their disciple, and to guide him selflessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the Mizar Sword Immortal knew this very well in his heart, it was still hard to bear it at this time. He said, "Forget it, I also don't want to think too much. Wei Er and Little Mo can kill him. Wu Yu is brave enough to dare to fight with them. He is really seeking his death."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ursae Sword Immortal shook his head and said, "Not necessarily. I think that based on Wu Yu's character, he is calm now and will not do anything that is risky. He is still confident in himself."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he finished this sentence, Wu Yu showed off his 1,000 doppelgangers. This scene made the Mizar Sword Immortal look a little nervous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had displayed the power of this mystique before, especially in the Trial of Yan. But everyone remembered clearly that at that time, Wu Yu could only produce 100 doppelgangers, not 1,000.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Today, his 1,000 doppelgangers equaled almost one-tenth of those on the Yan Huang Warship, so even the people on the Yan Huang Warship were very shocked at this time, and they clearly sensed that the Violet Kingdom Primordial Energy of these doppelgangers was very powerful! They were no weaker than any Earth sword rank disciple from Shushan, and were even comparable to Heaven sword rank disciples!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once his doppelgangers were out, it was time he faced the combined attack of Nangong Wei and Beishan Mo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before that strong attack, Wu Yu and his 1,000 doppelgangers attacked almost simultaneously and punched out! It was an impressive scene where 1,000 people threw out a punch at the same time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oblivion Beast Soul Shocking Technique!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An Oblivion Beast Soul Shocking Technique was nothing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When 1,000 Oblivion Beast Soul Shocking Techniques were used at the same time, they formed 1,000 giant beast souls. These illusory giant beasts were like 10,000 steeds galloping. They roared in the sky and were like an army, rushing towards Beishan Mo and Nangong Wei. In an instant, they clashed against the pair's attack! This was an attack that struck the soul, so it could not be blocked by Nangong Wei and Beishan Mo's Heaven Earth Void techniques!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After passing through, it became a big threat to the pair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After executing the Oblivion Beast Soul Shocking Techniques, Wu Yu and his 1,000 doppelgangers equipped themselves. The doppelgangers took out their longswords and Wu Yu held the Chief Emperor Sword and Grand Emperor Sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The doppelgangers suddenly spread out and stood at the positions of a spirit design.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Nine Suns Black Dragon Sword Formation!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, this was the real retaliation, and it was relatively dangerous. Luckily, Wu Yu had many doppelgangers. Some were in front and some were at the back. Those in front blocked for a short time, while those at the back had already finished their preparations. They blocked the Sword of Ten Thousand Waves and countless feathers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the Nine Suns Black Dragon Sword Formation of the thousand doppelgangers activated. 1,000 people executed it at the same time. Their black dragon sword qi was sent in the direction that their swords pointed. These rays of sword qi transformed into fiery mystical dragons. Every nine fiery mystical dragons grouped together and formed a sword formation. 1,000 people formed over 100 sword formations, all of which which rushed into the attack of Nangong Wei and Beishan Mo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was proving that in such a grand attack, he would not be weaker than the pair, but stronger! The Nine Suns Black Dragon Sword Formation from 1,000 people was terrifyingly strong! All the doppelgangers used all their strength. Every one of them was like an attack from a Heaven sword rank disciple. Nangong Wei and Beishan Mo had only just reached the Heaven sword rank level!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang, bang, bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the loud explosion, Wu Yu's Unshackled Doppelganger mystique, in which he had invested mountains of resources, exhibited terrifying moves and totally suppressed the other party's attack. It directly swallowed that Sword of Ten Thousand Waves's sword qi. Even Nangong Wei's feathers were all burned cleanly. Everywhere the angry dragons went, all was destroyed! Everyone watched as 1,000 angry dragons tore apart Nangong Wei and Beishan Mo's attacks, and rolled over them in total suppression!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, the shapeless giant beasts from the Oblivion Beast Soul Shocking Techniques had already rushed to Nangong Wei and Beishan Mo. Behind them, 600 angry dragons were destroyed, but there were still 400 that followed. They formed a terrifying suppression for Nangong Wei and Beishan Mo from two sides!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When their Heaven Earth Void techniques were totally destroyed by Wu Yu, Beishan Mo and Nangong Wei were both shocked!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was the ultimate killer move from their cooperation that they had prepared carefully. Even the Mizar Sword Immortal had given it very good review.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But at this moment, Wu Yu had destroyed it easily!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Destroy, suppress!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the start, Wu Yu had easily suppressed Beishan Mo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And now, since they had joined hands, many people also thought that they were bound to win. Wu Yu still relied on his Unshackled Doppelganger mystique to suppress them again! Now the Oblivion Beast Soul Shocking Techniques and Nine Suns Black Dragon Sword Formation was pressing towards them at the same time with an overpowering presence. Beishan Mo and Nangong Wei were both scared to the point that their faces had turned white!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Neptune's Dark Fortress, retreat!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both of them could only protect themselves in this emergency situation. They recalled their mystiques and concentrated on them their bodies, transforming them into armor. The two of them escaped, one to the left and the other to the right.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the Oblivion Beast Soul Shocking Techniques rolled towards them. Their escape helped them avoid a head-on blow, but their souls were still shocked. In an instant, they were shocked out of their senses and almost fainted onto the ground. Closely following was the Nine Suns Black Dragon Sword Formation. They could not escape, even though they had tried their best. The two of them were thrown to the left and right respectively. Beishan Mo's defensive Neptune's Dark Fortress directly split open under the black dragons' attack. The angry flames burned and attacked, and Beishan Mo screamed in agony. His whole body was burned black. In this instant, Wu Yu appeared before him with terrifying speed. He raised his sword and chopped down. After Beishan Mo was badly injured, he directly used the Grand Emperor Sword to chop away the arm that held the Green Depths Emperor Sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An arm flew out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Wu Yu was about to kill Beishan Mo, someone gave him a stern shout from behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was Nangong Wei's voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a loud crash, Beishan Mo fell to the ground, his face terribly pale. This time, he was really severely injured and could no longer retaliate. He had lost too badly. He was so confident in himself before, and he never expected to be suppressed by Wu Yu in any way, shape, or form. And it was a total suppression - he had no way of retaliation at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unimaginable pain and grievance descended on him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Faced with Wu Yu's domineering gaze, he felt like taking his own life now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But actually, Nangong Wei had saved him. Wu Yu did not target Nangong Wei. To be honest, he was unwilling to really hurt her. Hence, most of the attacks were directed at Beishan Mo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, at this moment, Nangong Wei could stand behind Wu Yu and shout at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when Wu Yu turned back, he saw that Nangong Wei looked very pitiful too. Her dress was covered with soil and blood stains. Her hair was a mess. She no longer had the beauty and purity that made people want to smile. Her past beauty was now breaking into pieces right before his very eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was very cathartic for Wu Yu to look at her now. But she was someone whom he had a good relationship with, so he could not be totally heartless. He could see that her heart was totally shattered now. There was even a shred of terror for Wu Yu in her eyes. This was because Wu Yu had so easily defeated the attack she was most confident in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing her limp and Beishan Mo in such a pathetic state, Wu Yu actually knew that his attack on them today was enough. Now Beishan Mo wanted to kill himself badly and Nangong Wei was a mess. She might even feel like killing herself too. After all, they were facing the disappointment of millions of sword cultivators now, and even painful looks. This was a terrible defeat for all of Shushan's disciples. Hence, all the Shushan disciples were shocked and even watching blankly as the events unfolded. Their bodies were shivering. They could not even hold onto the swords in their hands and let them fall to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the greatest blow to their dao hearts!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the same for Beishan Mo and Nangong Wei. In reality, such a heavy injury was even more serious than killing them, because this would cause them to live in regret and never recover fully. From now on, whenever they saw Wu Yu, their first reaction would be fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, it no longer mattered whether he killed them or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Until now, Wu Yu had already won an unimaginable reward and ending. For instance, when he raised his head and looked at the Mizar Sword Immortal, he was also looking at him with disbelief. Recalling how he used to be so forceful with him, perhaps he was regretting it now?</span></p>
