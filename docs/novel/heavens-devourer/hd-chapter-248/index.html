 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu failed in raising his cultivation level. He saw that it was almost time and prepared to go to the Mountain of Swords and Immortals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not know that at the moment, the Mountain of Swords and Immortals was already in an uproar over his absence. At the start, Shen Xingyu had controlled the situation. However, when the Battle of Swords and Immortals was almost over and Wu Yu had yet to appear, Shen Xingyu was helpless and came personally to look for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was forced to come here by the hundred thousand people that were watching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the mystery of whether Wu Yu would be picked by the Galaxy Sword Sage, it was not revealed yet. Many people had stayed on the Mountain of Swords and Immortals for long periods of time just to watch Wu Yu's next challenge. Some had even waited for more than three months….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that the Battle of Swords and Immortals was ending soon, who could wait any longer?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Baili Feihong had actually come by quite a few times, but after seeing Wu Yu train so hard every day, he did not disturb him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now there was no time left and he did not manage to rise to the third tier of Jindan. Luckily, he had made quite an improvement on his dao technique. He had thoroughly mastered the Yin Yang Heaven-Earth-Void Sword Art that was worth over 400 merits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, do you know what day it is?" Shen Xingyu asked. She did not know whether to laugh or cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't tell me that the Leaderboard of Swords and Immortals is already over?" Wu Yu's heart skipped a beat. He was too engrossed in his training and had failed to keep track of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was also a little disappointed that he did not become a third tier Jindan dao cultivator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Well, not yet. But it is the last day today. I did not disturb you before because I wanted to give you more time to reach a higher cultivation level. Do you have the confidence now?" Shen Xingyu asked out of concern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Things like confidence were not easy to talk about. Wu Yu only said, "No matter what, I will have to make a challenge today."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had set his goal early. The possibility that the Galaxy Sword Sage would recognize him probably existed only if he defeated the first in the Leaderboard of Swords and Immortals. Wu Yu was a person who did not admit defeat, especially on this. If he failed, he would be a laughing stock in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Okay, then you try your best. Now that the challenges of the Leaderboard of Swords and Immortals have basically ended, the top 10 remains unchanged. You might have two people as your opponents for today. Compared to you challenging them, they are more eager to challenge you because those two want to be my big brother's disciple more than you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu knew at first guess that at this moment, it would no longer be him challenging others. Rather, others would challenge him to prove that they were better than Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Actually, there are at least a thousand people who want to challenge you. I rejected them all. In the end, there are only two left. They are the toughest to reject and also the two who most desperately want to become my big brother's disciples. It is not an exaggeration to call them the top geniuses of the Common Sword Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"These two are respectively the first and second on the Leaderboard of Swords and Immortals. Speaking about them, it's quite interesting. Within these few months, they have become dao companions and will follow each other through life and death. Today, it can be considered a challenge from the two of them as a couple."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Dao companions?" Wu Yu was a little surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew who was first and second on this Leaderboard of Swords and Immortals. The first was known as a demon; he was the son of that Zhao Tianjian. The second was a young genius sent by the top family, the Tianyi Race, from the Crimson Flames Furnace to come to the Shushan Immortal Sect to practice sword techniques. It was rumored that she was female.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first was Zhao Xuanxian and the second was He Taiyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Let's go." To save time, Shen Xingyu grabbed onto Wu Yu, brought him on her sword, and flew towards the Mountain of Swords and Immortals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The distance to the Mountain of Swords and Immortals from here was not considered far for Shen Xingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, do you really understand my big brother?" Shen Xingyu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had heard many stories about the Galaxy Sword Sage. He, of course, knew him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Xingyu said, "For instance, Zhao Xuanxian and He Taiyao, both were chosen by Shushan Sword Sages to be their disciples, but they rejected them. This was all for my big brother to take them in. This means that if you pass my big brother's test, you will practically have a Shushan Sword Sage level master as your shield. From then on, in Shushan, every Common Sword Domain disciple, every Heaven, Earth, Xuan, Huang, the four major sword rank disciples, will have to be respectful towards you. They will envy you and fear you respectfully."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu knew what she was talking about. This could be described as reaching the skies in one step. It was just like when he was at the Heavenly Sword Sect at the beginning. Once he became the disciple of Feng Xueya, his status and position instantly changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hence, as your big sister, I'm reminding you one last time today to give it your all, and even to risk your life for the opportunity. My big brother is rarely interested in young disciples. Even Zhao Xuanxian is not within his considerations. You have to exceed Zhao Xuanxian by a lot to really let him make that decision. He is someone that does things very seriously. Once he acknowledges you, your fate will be different...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To put it simply, she wanted to tell him that today was the day he could change his fate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was also something important for the whole Shushan Immortal Sect, or even for the whole of the Heavenly continent. They were all paying close attention to his performance today. Wu Yu's fame was greatly boosted and even surpassed that of many Heaven sword rank disciples because of the Galaxy Sword Sage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I finally understand it!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He clenched his fists and flames gradually erupted from his arm and warmed his whole body. Unknowingly, the passion for battle was boiling within him at unprecedented levels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he neared the Mountain of Swords and Immortals, he finally knew what a real crowd was!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the whole Common Sword Domain, there was probably about 100,000 Jindan cultivators. However, with one look, the whole Mountain of Swords and Immortals was covered with them. There were also many disciples weaving through the surrounding skies on their swords, trying to get a good viewing position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many people, and many voices as well. Perhaps it was because Wu Yu was late that these people were getting impatient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wu Yu neared them, with Shen Xingyu leading the way, he was immediately spotted. Instantly, people's voices hit towards Wu Yu like an avalanche.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was almost thrown off by this terrifying aura. 100,000 gazes from Jindan cultivators concentrated instantly on him, and this feeling, this pressure was too overwhelming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Faintly, Wu Yu had sensed many Heaven sword rank disciples within the crowd. It could be seen how influential the Galaxy Sword Sage's words were to raise such a reaction with such a short sentence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This guy called Wu Yu must be too afraid to come out. If not for our insistence, he might not even have come out."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Look at him, hiding there. He does not look like a disciple of the Galaxy Sword Sage at all. Compared to the Galaxy Sword Sage, he is far too weak."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That is why I don't understand why the Galaxy Sword Sage chose to focus on this Wu Yu instead of people like Zhao Xuanxian. Besides, this Wu Yu does not have an upright character. He committed the crime of killing his own master. If not for Shen Xingyu's protection, I heard that he would’ve been subjected to the Sword Impalement Prison'."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Such an evil guy shouldn't even have the right to become a disciple of Shushan, right? This world is really unfair. Why is it that this Wu Yu can have such good luck?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't worry anymore. He hid for so long and is now out. The Galaxy Sword Sage is sure to see his true face clearly. Do you not trust the Galaxy Sword Sage's judgement? Who knows, he may be using Wu Yu to test Zhao Xuanxian and the others. This Wu Yu, I predict that he will be the stepping stone for Zhao Xuanxian and He Taiyao today."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You are right. We knew it from the moment Shen Xingyu allowed only Zhao Xuanxian and He Taiyao to challenge Wu Yu."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Speaking of it, who will fight Wu Yu first? It is better to have the first fight."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm guessing He Taiyao. She may be the top genius in the Tianyi Race, but compared to the Zhao Xuanxian, who received the legacy of the Heart Piercing Sword Sage, she is still lacking. Besides, they are lovers and have already become dao companions, so Zhao Xuanxian will give way to He Taiyao."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Discussions like this were everywhere and plentiful. They flooded into Wu Yu's ears and almost caused his brain to explode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Today, all battles on the battlefield had stopped and hence the battlefield was very empty. Wu Yu's opponents were still at the topmost positions on the Mountain of Swords and Immortals. They were hidden within the clouds, and the average person could not even see them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first on the Leaderboard of Swords and Immortals was indeed someone to be looked up to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Prepare well. The first battle will be with He Taiyao. Perform well and, of course, it is for him to see." Shen Xingyu helped Wu Yu and pointed to that star in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That star was cold. It was difficult to understand any of his thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking around, he suddenly saw two familiar people nearby. One was Zhao Tianjian and the other was Ye Caixie. These two people gathered together. Once Wu Yu looked over, Zhao Tianjian gave him a cold laugh and gestured to Wu Yu a slash across his throat. Reading his lips, he seemed to be saying, "It's your death sentence today."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Caixie stood with her arms crossed beside him and smiled very contentedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Zhao Xuanxian, He Taiyao, come down." Shen Xingyu called for them lightly. These two people could not wait for this moment ever since they received her permission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the hundred thousand gazes, the heavenly couple descended from the sky holding hands. The male was handsome and the female was seductive. They were the envy of many onlookers. They appeared together in front of Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With one look, one could tell that these two people were not average. Their demeanor, talent, and tier exceeded everyone on the Leaderboard of Swords and Immortals. That Situ Gongde from the past was nothing to these two. Just based on quality, they were better by many levels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two people were the most outstanding of the hundred thousand ordinary dan disciples. They even surpassed many older people, and even their Jindan were of unique quality. Their battle powers were already on par with that of fifth tier Jindan Huang sword rank disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, their immortal treasures and dao techniques were probably much better than what Wu Yu had now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Taiyao was said to be from the Crimson Flames Furnace’s Tianyi Race. The Tianyi Race had protected the Crimson Flames Furnace for generations. Their generations had been forged by the heaven and earth flames. Even though they were just one race, they possessed powers equivalent to that of Shushan and were one of the major powers of the heavenly continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the heavenly continent, all the major powers had the tradition of sending their disciples and descendents to other sects to undergo study exchanges. This He Taiyao was one such disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Tianyi Race were adept at archery. Their archery skills were comparable to Shushan's sword techniques. They could even kill from hundreds of thousands of li away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was rumored that He Taiyao was not only adept at bows and arrows, but also at swords. Her sword techniques were excellent and hence she was sent to Shushan to develop her strengths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu checked her out and saw that this lady, He Taiyao, had a very good figure. The key part was that she wore extremely little. She only covered her important parts with animal skins and leather. She exposed her shapely and smooth, long legs. Those were eye-catching. This person was cheerful and enthusiastic. Her skin was not snowy white, but a light golden brown. She had a sense of wild beauty. Her gaze was proud and her expression cold. It made people want to conquer her even more.</span></p>
