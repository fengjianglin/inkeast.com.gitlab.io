 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nanwu Treasured Moon Golden Vajra Body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having gained a better sense himself, Wu Yu found himself to have exceeded his previous state by miles. It was no wonder Ming Long had claimed that the Invincible Vajra Body would start showing its might at the third tier.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, he already found it a little hard to control his strength when he moved his arms and legs. While breathing, large amounts of smoke would be ejected from his nose and mouth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he looked to the rock and earth beside him, they started vaporizing. Wu Yu could almost see through the rocks and the layers of earth below it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A casual breath would reduce the rocks and earth in front of him to ashes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lifting his arms and moving the energy around him, the surroundings started trembling and a homing voice resounded in the dull and dark underground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Wu Yu had the feeling of becoming an immortal of the heavens and earth. Every punch or kick seemed capable of shattering the skies and ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From his head to toes, endless lava was raging within his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Jiu Ying looked down at this moment, he could no longer see any lava. Other than the figure of Wu Yu, the surroundings were pitched-black. The place they were in was just a small, empty area of the bottomless ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gradually gaining control, Wu Yu suppressed the overwhelming and explosive energy within his body. Soon, he was able to calm himself and become just like any ordinary man. The powers of the Subterranean Treasured Moon Furnace had been fused with every cell in his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Jiu Ying looked at him blankly, feeling dumbfounded. Jiu Ying had turned into his human form. He was still that exceptionally beautiful but pale-looking man with silky, long hair. This formed a strong contrast with Wu Yu's domineering, disdainful, and sharp image.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I can feel that you've made a huge leap forward. Congratulations," said Jiu Ying sincerely.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu replied, "I was lucky that Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain sent us here. Otherwise, I wouldn't have discovered the Subterranean Treasured Moon Furnace."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I had felt that the lava here was a little different. So it has a name too!" exclaimed Jiu Ying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu nodded his head. The whole process had taken about a day. It wasn't too long. However, for Wu Yu and Jiu Ying, every second mattered at this moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Now that the lava is gone, let me try to blast open a path directly. Let's see if we can charge out through this method." Wu Yu exchanged gazes with Jiu Ying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's what I had in mind too!" replied Jiu Ying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Previously, they were afraid that if they released relentless attacks, it might detonate the Subterranean Treasured Moon Furnace. If the lava flowed to the surface, it would blaze through thousands of miles of mountains and rivers and cause a catastrophe, not to mention killing them in the process.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Jiu Ying didn't feel like he was suitable for this role in this aspect. Therefore, he left this matter to Wu Yu, who had an insanely incredible physical body. Wu Yu retrieved the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Columns at this moment. While the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Columns were circulating and flying, they rapidly merged into one rod. Nine golden divine dragons wrapped around the rod and looked vivid. When Wu Yu extended one arm and held up the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column, the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column could sense his current strength. To his astonishment, it started trembling and let out a humming sound. One could even hear a dragon's roar that erupted!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Weng, weng, weng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surrounding environment started to tremble.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under Wu Yu's control, the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Columns started getting thicker and stronger. Soon, it grew to the length ten times taller than Wu Yu, with a diameter of a foot thick. At this moment, Wu Yu held the end of the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column with both of his hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Break!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He let out an angry growl and clubbed the floor violently before flinging the staff upwards. The ground below his feet gave way and crumbled. At that instant, the earth shook and time stood still. As for Wu Yu, he held on to the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column, turned into a blinding, golden ray, and shot out like an arrow leaving a bow. It crashed through the edge of the tunnel Jiu Ying had dug for an entire day instantly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Follow me," Wu Yu said to Jiu Ying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Not a problem!" Jiu Ying gave a faint smile before turning to a black shadow that followed closely behind Wu Yu like a specter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Subsequently, amidst an incredibly huge commotion, the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column rose towards the surface like a ten thousand zhang huge beast. At that instant, Wu Yu felt like he was capable of piercing through the skies with a single strike. Under the violent impact, the entire earth above him was being pushed upwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying felt as though the entire world was collapsing. The earth above Wu Yu was being pushed upwards, while the surrounding was falling down. At that moment, the ground was shattering, gravel was scattering, and earthquakes were incessant!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He focused entirely on chasing after that golden ray. Otherwise, he would probably be buried behind under this dull and dark underground when Wu Yu made his way out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The physical strength of his body is truly shocking. At the same level, no demon could be his match."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Jiu Ying was feeling shocked, Wu Yu manipulated the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column once again. On the surface, with the Wind and Thunder Cliff as the center, huge cracks spread across the surface within a radius of several hundred miles, revealing the dark environment under the surface. Countless mountain peaks collapsed and the river that was previously flowing through flooded into the cracks. The piece of land was being ripped apart constantly. One could clearly see that the Wind and Thunder Dao Sect on the cliff would have been ripped apart rapidly even if it had its Sect Protecting Spirit Design activated. The entire Wind and Thunder Dao Sect fell with the debris and was instantly buried under earth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under such circumstances, Wu Yu managed to finally get out of the depths of the ground while flattening the ground that spanned several hundred miles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying followed closely behind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the two of them got out, the surrounding ground shook violently for some time before stopping. One could easily conclude that there were no longer any living things within the vicinity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wind and Thunder Dao Sect!" Wu Yu noticed a corner of the Wind and Thunder Dao Sect and immediately understood that the Wind and Thunder Dao Sect had been buried.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was, he understood that if the cultivators of Wind and Thunder Dao Sect were still alive, an earthquake like this wouldn't have caused much trouble for these martial cultivators. At the very minimum, they wouldn't be buried alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain had already appeared here. Therefore, the chances of them surviving till now was close to zero.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, when Wu Yu dug out the Wind and Thunder Dao Sect, all he saw was basically corpses under the crushed buildings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, their death state was similar to the victims in Qingsang City and the Lan Ling Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clearly, Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain had set up his array here. He probably took some time to rest while finishing off the remains of the Wind and Thunder Dao Sect in the meantime.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at these despairing and horrified faces, the rage in Wu Yu's heart burned furiously. He even felt that this was his fault.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm sorry for my incompetence that allowed this spawn of evil to have his way."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within his body, the flames of anger shrouding him went berserk like the lava, and one could even see the streams of lava that flowed throughout his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column that he held in his hand was also trembling. He was just like a huge beast that was looking upon the devastation beneath him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Qingsang City, the Lan Ling Sect, the Sky Fissure Sword Sect, and now the Wind and Thunder Dao Sect. He has already massacred the people of these four areas. Clearly, he won't be letting the other six forces off. My guess is that he is now massacring the cultivators of these six forces in order to complete his Ghost Isolation Array. Wu Yu, now isn't the time to condemn yourself. Since you have made a breakthrough, we should work together to stop him from committing such heinous crimes." Jiu Ying analyzed calmly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right!" Wu Yu suppressed the anger within him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The change to the landscape here was similar to burying the dead. In a way, this could be considered as a burial. Wu Yu didn't stay here for long. The dead deserved respect and therefore he kneeled down and made a few kowtows.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Life and death are part of the world. No matter if one is an ordinary man or a martial cultivator, he can't escape the fate of death. I just hope that they can now rest in peace. I'll definitely take revenge for everyone."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After which, he executed some unorthodox arts which flattened the surrounding rubble so as to not let others disturb the peace of these souls.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Humans, or even demons, have an ending point to life. Try to look past death." Seeing Wu Yu's impatience, Jiu Ying attempted to console him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu shook his head and replied, "No, for my life, I don't wish to have an end."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You wish to become an immortal?" asked Jiu Ying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No. I must definitely become one."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ambitious!" Jiu Ying didn't dwell on it. The truth was that he felt loss as a demon. Although demons could keep getting stronger, they didn't know what they would become when they cultivated to the end. Would it be similar to martial cultivators, where they would also reach the heavenly and sky palaces and become immortals? Or would it be.... Among the demons, there were no such answers. It seemed like there weren't any answers recorded in history either. At the very minimum, ordinary demons or young demons wouldn't know the answer to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the two of them were preparing to look for Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain, the sky to their west was shrouded by bloody mist that was spreading towards them. Moreover, the speed of the spreading was very fast.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain. He has not gone far away. Our appearance has alarmed him," Jiu Ying said solemnly while having his hands behind him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline"><span class="Apple-tab-span">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu also seemed to have seen a black figure within the bloody clouds. He was none other than Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain. He had conjured his Spiritual Frame of the Black Mountain once again, which clearly showed that his injuries had mostly recovered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He hasn't gone far. This likely shows that he spent quite some time to recuperate from his injuries and that he just left recently. If that's the case, the people in the other forces should still be safe." Wu Yu was relieved to hear the conclusion, and his mood improved a little.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, his hatred and killing intent for Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain had exceeded what he had felt towards many people in his life. It was almost at the level of hatred he once had for Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hey, little brats, you guys sure are defiant! How dare you damage my Ghostly Isolation Array.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To their surprise, Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain was furious. He was even shivering in anger while cursing on his way back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu immediately understood. When he charged out from the ground and flattened the surroundings, he had altered the structure of the Ghost Isolation Array. Clearly, the alteration was linked to the Wind and Thunder Dao Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result, Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain couldn't continue setting up his Ghost Isolation Array within a short time frame.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Wu Yu had hoped for, a match to the death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu exchanged a glance with Jiu Ying and Jiu Ying nodded his head in approval. Although the two of them had not known each other for long, they had chemistry. Jiu Ying transformed into his demon form directly at this moment. A savage-looking, huge beast appeared in front of the eyes of Wu Yu. Those nine fierce-looking heads possessed nine different catastrophic negative energies. Soon, these energies swept across and turned the surrounding area that spanned a thousand miles eerie and creepy. The might of these energies wasn't much weaker than Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain, who was rushing over within the raging sea of blood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I did not expect you guys to be able to dig your way out of the ground so quickly. You guys are just like lost souls. Now that I've drank the blood of the people of the Wind and Thunder Dao Sect, my injuries have largely recovered. I shall finish you guys off directly this time and prevent you from jumping out and foiling my plans again!" the two heads of Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain bellowed at the same time. The next instant, he approached Wu Yu and Jiu Ying. Six black flags appeared in his six hands. As he waved them, black flames swept forth!&nbsp;</span></p>
