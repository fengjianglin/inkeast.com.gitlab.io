 <p dir="ltr"><br></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These strongest existences in the Divine Continent had made such a surprising decision this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But no one objected. After all, Wu Yu would most likely be the champion, and everyone was agreeable to his own proposal to increase the difficulty level.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But everyone thought that people like the Taixu Sage Master and the Dubhe Sword Immortal would be unwilling. They were people who were most respectful of traditions and most unwilling to break the rules. For instance, they stood by the rule to not fight the demons and cause a war.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was on the premise that the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial could proceed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since rule-abiding people like the Taixu Sage Master had not stood by the rules in this case, then most people, while surprised by their decision, did not object.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the Lunar Flower Sword Sage, who still harbored hatred for Wu Yu, could only keep her mouth shut after the stronger Sword Immortal glanced at her. After all, even the Mizar Sword Immortal had no objections to Wu Yu's rule-breaking action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a little strange. However, many thought that perhaps the Taixu Sage Master and the Dubhe Sword Immortal had agreed to it because they were grabbing the opportunity for Ji Lingshuang and Nangong Wei to get the championship. As for how the youngsters viewed this rule-breaking action, it was none of most people's businesses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Taixu Sage Master would be the one to carry this responsibility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the Taixu Sage Master's gaze looked gentle. He did not speak much and directly announced for the other six to battle. He looked at Wu Yu calmly. Wu Yu looked at him. He knew that he was helping him, but sometimes, the anger in his heart could not be appeased by just a few sentences. Wu Yu knew that such restlessness was not right, but it was useless just knowing about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other six participants had no objections when presented with such an opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu now stood at the center of the Upper Immortal Battle Ground. The six participants from six different powers arrived from different directions. Of them, four were over 40 years old and were eighth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivators. However, Ji Lingshuang and Nangong Wei were no weaker than them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Lingshuang was at the front. She was initially confused with the Taixu Sage Master's decision, and at this moment, when faced with Wu Yu, she could only force herself to battle. This angelic woman in a long, flowing, white dress looked holy. She was like an angel landing in the mortal realm. She appeared before Wu Yu. She was the true champion of the Divine Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, she was actually very proud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now she held her dao treasure, the Immortal Palace Painting, in her hands and advanced towards Wu Yu. On the Immortal Palace Painting, spirit designs started to shine. The ink lines on the painting were parts of the spirit designs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Since ancient times, those who were overly confident were never heroes. I have judged you wrongly, Wu Yu," Ji Lingshuang said coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With this dao treasure, she was a great threat. The Immortal Palace Painting could be expanded at any time and the power of this dao treasure would explode violently. It was said that this Immortal Palace Painting, when used well, could summon heavenly immortal guards from within to fight for Ji Lingshuang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as she completed her sentence, a fiery aura spread out at Wu Yu's left. Nine different colored flames flashed before him. This was expected. When facing Wu Yu, Nangong Wei had already transformed into the immortal beast phoenix. That huge yet holy and fiery immortal beast. She flew into the sky and flapped her nine-colored wings. With each flap of her wings, fierce fire rolled on earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was arrogance and stubbornness within her phoenix eyes. She stared at Wu Yu. Perhaps she knew that Wu Yu's current condition was not right, but her goal for this trip was to get a chance to fight Wu Yu and defeat him. She could not be stopped, no matter the changes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other four used their own various techniques. While they did not possess dao treasures and were not immortal beasts, they each had the Violet Kingdom Primordial Energy of an eighth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator. This was something Wu Yu lacked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The six of them looked at each other. Ji Lingshuang said, "Everyone, since Wu Yu has made such a choice, then we need not be polite. We can cooperate and defeat him first. As for the championship, we can compete fairly and decide later. I believe that everyone is unwilling to be belittled like this by him as well!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Lingshuang was the reigning champion for so many years. While she was female, she was very proud. Gusu Yudie was not strong enough to challenge her authority and will. While Wu Yu had appeared out of nowhere, in her heart, she still had a strong desire to win.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sure, Miss Ji is the disciple of the Taixu Sage Master. We naturally trust you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"My suggestion is also to defeat Wu Yu together."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone voiced their opinions and looked at Nangong Wei. While Nangong Wei did not speak, once they thought about the story between her and Wu Yu, they believed that she would not be hesitant in defeating Wu Yu. Because she had not only transformed into an immortal beast but also taken out her dao treasure. The World Obliterating Furnace was actually hidden under her feathers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were probably prepared to attack after they had reached an agreement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, after Wu Yu had defeated the Blood Dragon of Mount Wu, there was practically no mystery left. However, with Wu Yu's proposal, the end of this Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial was now filled with suspense and excitement again! If Wu Yu lost the chance to win the championship because of his arrogance, then people would only think that he deserved it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Why is the Imperial General not here? If the Imperial General was here, he probably would stop him from doing this."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If Wu Yu loses, he will be so embarrassed. No matter what, he doesn't look like the type of person to make such an idiotic decision."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Or perhaps we have thought too highly of him and this Wu Yu actually only has foolish courage, and is a very arrogant person who belittles everyone."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When everyone was discussing, the battle suddenly exploded. Wu Yu faced six of them alone. The first to attack was not from those six - it was from Wu Yu, who was surrounded by the six. At this moment, everyone could see that Wu Yu had instantly transformed into a golden ape. He was tall and his physique was large and strong! His eyes were bloody red and he had a violent aura, like that of a furious beast. This aura was released continuously from his body and rolled out in waves. Such a violent Wu Yu caused the six to feel a little terrified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Unshackled Doppelganger!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the Immortal Ape Transformation, Wu Yu plucked out his golden hairs and blew at them. Instantly, 1,000 doppelgangers appeared beside him. Originally, he looked weak in numbers, and now the side that was truly weak in numbers was the six of them. They were about to suffer the attacks of 1,000 golden immortal apes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But everyone knew that Wu Yu's unshackled doppelgangers had weaker defense and could be destroyed easily. Hence, they were not too worried at the moment and retaliated quickly. The six of them activated their immortal treasures almost simultaneously and attacked with their various Great Dao Mystiques or Heaven Earth Void techniques!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Fight!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could only feel better and be relieved of hatred through venting his anger in battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's eyes were blood red, and when he roared in anger, all his doppelgangers followed him and let out shocking roars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">1,000 people roaring - such a violent display of power shocked the audience. They could not deny Wu Yu's power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But what happened next was what truly shocked them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Prime Heavenly Lord Supreme God Technique!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had used the Ten Thousand Furnace Lords’ Supreme God Technique to defeat Blood Dragon of Mount Wu, but he had never used this Prime Heavenly Lord Supreme God Technique. Hence, no one knew that he had actually learned both Supreme God Techniques. This was the qualification that only the heir of both the Yan Huang City Lord and Yan Huang Imperial General could possess!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Wu Yu's roar shook the heavens and earth. The strong, shiny light on his body instantly turned his body golden in color. That was originally the blood and flesh immortal body of the Immortal Ape Transformation. He transformed into a golden being and looked like he was forged out of gold. He was steady like a mountain. At this moment, he was like an imperial emperor descending from the heavens to rule the world. This authoritative aura of ancient imperial emperors had only appeared on the Yan Huang City Lord before. This was, after all, the trump card of the previous Yan Huang City Lord!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But just that was definitely not shocking enough. It only proved that Wu Yu had built on the strengths of his Invincible Vajra Body and had made his physique and defense even more tyrannical than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The key was that this applied not only to him. At the same time, the thousand doppelgangers who were with him also used the Prime Heavenly Lord Supreme God Technique. Instantly, there were 1,000 apes who looked like they were forged of gold. They stood there in a tidy row. They looked authoritative and belligerent at the same time. They looked undefeatable!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such a scene terrified the six participants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Wu Yu used the Prime Heavenly Lord Supreme God Technique, the eyes of his 1,000 doppelgangers pierced the other six like swords. Up until this moment, the six of them were prepared to attack. However, they froze in terror because of the Prime Heavenly Lord Supreme God Technique. And it was at this instant that the 1,000 doppelgangers split into four formations. Each formation had about 250 doppelgangers, and they attacked four different opponents respectively!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu took on two opponents by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His original body chose Ji Lingshuang and Nangong Wei as his two opponents. Not because they were great beauties, but because they had dao treasures. Their dao treasures could penetrate the Prime Heavenly Lord Supreme God Technique on the doppelgangers, whereas the other four could not do that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A chaotic, vicious battle exploded between the doppelgangers and the four participants first!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each one of the four were surrounded by over 200 doppelgangers, and when the doppelgangers surrounded them, every doppelganger looked fierce and evil. They did not pause, and every one of them quickly used a dao technique again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, black, angry fire rolled out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the Ten Thousand Furnace Lords' Supreme God Technique!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Previously, the Blood Dragon of Mount Wu was defeated with Wu Yu's Ten Thousand Furnace Lords' Supreme God Technique. At that time, Wu Yu had attacked simultaneously with 1,000 doppelgangers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now there were only over 200 doppelgangers, and more than 10 of them did not use the technique. They waved their supreme immortal treasures and suppressed their opponent. Under Wu Yu's control, they were all part of Wu Yu's body. Hence, their battle techniques were quick and fierce. Just as the doppelgangers in charge of suppressing the opponents had restricted their respective target’s movements, the rest of them directly attacked with the Ten Thousand Furnace Lords' Supreme God Technique!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang, bang, bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These remaining four could not escape, and no matter how much power they had, they failed to put up any significant defenses before they suffered this flurry of attacks. After learning the Prime Heavenly Lord Supreme God Technique, these doppelgangers' defenses were no weaker than that of their opponents. Hence, the doppelgangers that were split out to restrict their opponents were very crucial. They simply took advantage of brute strength to force the four away and followed up with the Ten Thousand Furnace Lords' Supreme God Technique!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the advantage of numbers in battle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the tide of doppelgangers, the four of them were defeated instantly!</span></p>
