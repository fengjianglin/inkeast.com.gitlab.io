 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"After Wang Fu and the others left, they must have found Zhang Futu and let him know that I was here. That is why he went to such pains to come here."</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wu Yu caught on quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was clear that he was nothing but a fat sheep to the hungry tiger that was Zhang Futu. Now that he had scented Wu Yu, he came prowling. Those flat eyes actually held a sinister desire to kill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Futu looked around, asking, "All these people. You defeated them?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was nothing in his voice, but he was actually surprised and pleased. From the moment Wu Yu defeated Wang Fu, he knew that it was more than talent. He knew that Wu Yu must have some ultimate legacy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu said, "Not so. They fought each other, and I slipped in for the scraps."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Very good. No less than expected of my disciple." Zhang Futu gave a light laugh, sketching past it. In truth, Wu Yu already knew what Zhang Futu had decided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since he was the Abyss Guard, then his job was to resolve the Vajra Sword Talismans and bring the disciples out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he landed on the floor and banished the Vajra Sword Talismans, he asked Wu Yu, "Are you going out, or staying here?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a dangerous question indeed. Wu Yu had come here to avoid him. Why would Wu Yu leave?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was just about to say no, when a thought struck him cold. Zhang Futu was the Abyss Guard now. He had the right to roam within the Demons' Abyss. This was his dominion, and if he killed Wu Yu secretly, then no one would know, and he would not need to worry!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As long as Zhang Futu could enter and leave with impunity, the Demons' Abyss was even more dangerous than the outside for Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was already sure that this Zhang Futu, who knew what Wu Yu was hiding, would one day betray him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And so he changed his answer at the last moment, saying, "Your disciple has been here for many days, and has accumulated some modest rewards. I plan to return to Futu Hall and cultivate in peace in a day or two."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's own innocent poise hoped to lull Zhang Futu into thinking that Jindan Cave and the Demons' Abyss were all coincidences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's good." Zhang Futu gave another narrow smile. He had already assumed control over all the disciples who had used the Vajra Sword Talisman, pulling them beside him. He stepped on his sword energy and looked down from above. "You have just reached the Jindan Dao Realm. Better settle down and train a few more dao techniques."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had not said anything to persuade Wu Yu to stay. After he finished, he used the Art of Sword Flight and left. After all, they were in public, and he could not call suspicion to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Zhang Futu had left, Wu Yu finally relaxed a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wei was a little confused. "Big Brother, is that the man you're hiding from?" She could feel it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's expression was solemn. He said, "I have to leave the Demons' Abyss immediately. Are you still with me? It's going to be dangerous."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Didn't you say you would leave in a day or two?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu shook his head. "That was a lie. I must leave now. Moreover, I might leave Shushan immediately after leaving the Demons' Abyss, for three months."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was very clear that if he had said he was leaving immediately, then Zhang Futu would have brought him out, and it would be difficult to escape his control. And now that Zhang Futu had left, he had to follow immediately. Each day in the Demons' Abyss was exposure to the risk of being caught by Zhang Futu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The opponent was getting anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, word of Wu Yu's talent would continue to spread.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Big Brother, you are leaving Shushan?" Nangong Wei's eyes lit up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had considered other courses of action as well, but for now, leaving Shushan seemed to be the best way to shrug Zhang Futu off. He definitely could not return to Futu Hall. Although the Common Sword Domain was large, he would be found by Zhang Futu. And if he left, he would be harder to find.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wei clung to his arm, saying, "Wei Er wants to go too. I've never left Shushan before!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was extremely excited, and had let slip that her parents were of Shushan. They might very well be experts at Shushan, and possibly Heaven sword rank disciples or the like. That was the only way she could have grown up at Shushan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had no idea how dangerous this journey would be, and was loath to bring her along.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But seeing his hesitation, Nangong Wei reached out to hug him like an octopus. "I want to go with you. Don't abandon me, Big Brother."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She gave a pained look, her puppy eyes threatening to erupt into full-out, on-the-floor wailing if Wu Yu did not agree."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright...." After being together for all this time, Wu Yu was helpless when she was like this. This child was too pretty, as though she had walked straight out of a dream. Although she had not yet matured, her fresh youthfulness made one want to protect her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Let's go."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not proceed in the direction that Zhang Futu had gone, but instead took the most circuitous route he could. He passed through subterranean forests, through rivers, and finally hid near the entrance. He had said that he would leave after a day or two, and he guessed that Zhang Futu would be looking for him near the entrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What remained was a battle of wills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu and Nangong Wei could see the entrance, even while they themselves remained concealed. They kept their eyes on the entrance at all times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"After he brings them out, he should be coming back to find me, or he will wait for me at the entrance."</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;That was Wu Yu's prediction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why he would not go, not before he had ascertained Zhang Futu's position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, not long after Wu Yu arrived, Zhang Futu had already settled those who had used the Vajra Sword Talismans. He immediately returned to the Demons' Abyss at a more sedate pace, searching in the direction that Wu Yu had been with the fox demon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He really wanted to finish me off in the Demons' Abyss!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Luckily I knew his goal. I could arrive here a step ahead. Otherwise, if I had remained near there, I would have nowhere to run if I met him in a deserted place."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hiding in the gloom and watching Zhang Futu's receding figure, Wu Yu's gaze was flat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who would have thought that the one who brought me to the Shushan Immortal Sect would be my true enemy."&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu should have been grateful to him, but now he just felt like he was a slab of meat on the block.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After finally confirming that Zhang Futu had disappeared into the darkness, and that he could no longer see the entrance, Wu Yu left with Nangong Wei, leaving Zhang Futu in the dark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If he had just guarded the entrance, I would have been trapped. But Zhang Futu is the hasty kind, and cannot watch for too long."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After leaving, Wu Yu returned at speed to the black hall, returning the Vajra Sword Talisman and then leaving readily. He and Nangong Wei naturally did not return to Futu Hall, but used the Art of Sword Flight to get out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Common Sword Domain was a huge place. By the time Zhang Futu noticed, it would be difficult to find him even in the Common Sword Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After coming out, they were washed in spiritual qi. Along with the bright, daylight sun, they felt much better, especially when they looked at the towering Clear Sky of Shushan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He dares to covet my transformation. In the end, let's see who it is that falls."</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Looking back at the Demons' Abyss, Wu Yu's heart was nothing but ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Big Brother, now we've gotten free of that baddy. If we leave the sect, where should we go?" Nangong Wei was also panting. She had been quite nervous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu said, "As long as we do not leave from the door of the Green Glass Sword Palace, leaving from anywhere should be fine. I need three months as buffer."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He naturally knew that he was currently far from Zhang Futu. He would go anywhere to find breathing space. In this period of cat and mouse with Zhang Futu, he had grown more and more dissatisfied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Zhang Futu's eyes, he must’ve seemed like a juicy piece of meat... that could walk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Aren't we going to the Achievement Hall to exchange the demons we killed for merits and sword cores? With sword cores, we can go to the Immortal Treasures Hall, the Dao Arts Hall, and other such places to trade for treasures."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, each sword palace had its own Achievement Hall, Immortal Treasures Hall, Dao Arts Hall, Immortal Essence Hall, Immortal Medicine Hall, Talisman Hall, and Miscellaneous Treasures Hall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Achievement Hall was where one handed in one's merits to exchange for sword cores.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other halls were different from halls like Futu Hall. They were there expressly to accept sword cores in exchange for valuable objects. Each hall held countless treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, ordinary merits could be traded for sword cores with the assistant hall masters, and then traded with them as well. Except the assistant hall masters would hold on to fewer valuables.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire Common Sword Domain also had the Achievements Central Hall, Immortal Treasures Central Hall, and so on. They were of a massive scale, and the treasures inside were like grains of sand in a river. The million years of Shushan Immortal Sect history were accumulated there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, only fourth tier Jindan Dao Realm cultivators and above could enter the central halls. Even if the assistant hall masters did not have the needed treasures for the other ordinary dan disciples, the halls at each sword palace would be sufficient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The immortal medicine refining arts and medicinal furnaces that the pair wanted could be easily obtained from assistant hall masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They considered this. If they exchanged their merits now, they would each have slightly more than 10 sword cores. After the medicinal furnace, they could get one immortal medicine refining art at best. The refining of many immortal medicines was closely related to the ingredients, fire, medicinal furnace, and steps. For Wu Yu, completely clueless about the whole thing, he had to find a way to refine immortal medicines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had too few merits, and Wu Yu shook his head. He said, "Next time, then. Let's not waste time now. We'll decide after we leave."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Zhang Futu found that they were not in the Demons' Abyss, he would definitely come out to search for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once he learned that Wu Yu understood his plans, he might take a more direct approach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By escaping the Shushan Immortal Sect, he would at least have three months to prepare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After obtaining Nangong Wei's consent, Wu Yu began a large-scale movement across the Shushan Immortal Sect. They basically moved from the east to the south side of the Common Sword Domain. This journey alone cost him 10 days’ time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, he could not fly quickly within the Common Sword Domain, and he also had to avoid taboo grounds and clashes with other Shushan disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was roughly a million disciples at the Common Sword Domain, and hundreds of thousands of Jindan practitioners. Every day, there were countless swords flying in and out of the clouds. A majestic sight!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At Wu Yu's current strength, he was not considered an elite in the Common Sword Domain. There were still many disciples here gunning for the Huang sword rank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After 10 days, Wu Yu had entered the territory of the Red Heart Sword Palace. The Red Heart Sword Palace was a sword palace on the periphery of the Common Sword Domain, and it had a gate that led outside of Shushan.</span></p>
