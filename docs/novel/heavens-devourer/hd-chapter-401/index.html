 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu stared coldly at Beishan Mo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To be honest, he did not believe him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Lunar Flower Sword Sage and the Distant Fire Sword Sage, who had been cultivating for hundreds of years, were the top figures after the Seven Immortals of Shushan. They were really strong. Wu Yu had to admit that he feared them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he was never afraid of Beishan Mo. Even if he was lacking and was currently behind Beishan Mo, he strongly believed that this was only temporary! In this aspect, he had absolute confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wei had never liked him, let alone become his dao companion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing his cold gaze, Beishan Mo smiled and said, "I know you don't believe it, but this day will come. I advise you to have some mental preparation. Also, there is a very important thing. Let me ask you: do you want to make a real end with the Lunar Flower Sword Sage and Distant Fire Sword Sage? Do you think that one day, you can step back into Shushan and prove yourself?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Say what you want, don't beat around the bush." Wu Yu sneered, his gaze like blazing fire. To be honest, if the two Sword Sages were not here, he would like to fight with him now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beishan Mo said, "It's very simple. What did the lowly people beside you say just now? You will make Shushan regret in three years’ time? I would like to see how you can make Shushan regret in three years! I will give you the chance! Three years from today, come to Shushan to challenge me! Go to the Mortal Arena. After the battle, win or lose, the grudges between the two Sword Sage and you will all be in the past. Do you dare to do so?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He made himself sound so heroic. What he said made the seas surge and the heavens and earth stir.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was something that he had decided on his own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Lunar Flower Sword Sage and the Distant Fire Sword Sage's eyes brightened. They looked at each other and thought in their hearts that Beishan Mo was really smart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu must have felt wronged to be expelled from Shushan. He must be eager to go back to Shushan and prove himself, especially to defeat Beishan Mo. Therefore, he will not refuse. If he agrees and he dies in battle, it's his own business. Yan Huang Imperial City cannot blame us then!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yes, Yan Huang Imperial City now holds him in high regard. This is the only way to make him take the bait!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the two of them discussed secretly, Huangfu Pojun said hurriedly to Wu Yu, "Don't make this promise. With your talent, they won't dare to touch you. You don't have to go to Shushan to take risks. If you accept this challenge, Yan Huang Imperial City won't be able to help you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Wu Yu understood these reasons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the time period was three years!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since it was three years, what was there to be afraid of?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He just smiled lightly at Huangfu Pojun. He was confident. Then, in front of all the Yan Huang Immortal Soldiers, even several ghostly cultivators in hiding, he turned towards Beishan Mo and said, "Alright, three years from today, I will go to Shushan and battle you in the Mortal Arena."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had spoken slowly, but heavily, decisively, and calmly. His words were filled with determination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Very good, very courageous." Beishan Mo was very happy, but he did not show it on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He began to imagine that he would finally prove himself to that man in three years. This proof was even more important than Wu Yu's proof!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The audience was in an uproar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had left Shushan, but the problem was not solved. The Lunar Flower Sword Sage was still chasing him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His relationship with Nangong Wei was still complicated. Sometimes, Wu Yu would miss her, but other times, he knew that his relationship with her was history.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Today, Beishan Mo had stood out for him. He had used his wits to give him this chance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Wu Yu agreed, Beishan Mo walked towards Wu Yu and forced Huangfu Pojun and the others to make way until he stood in front of Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them stared at each other. Two pairs of eyes, one like fire, the other like ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beishan Mo’s lips curled into a cold smile and he said lightly, “Since you’ve promised, I’ll announce it to the world. Today, we stand before so many witnesses. Three years from today, I’ll wait for you at the Mortal Arena. You better show up then. If not, everyone will laugh at you and not me, Beishan Mo.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Relax, I’ll claim your head in three years,” Wu Yu said without much care.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was really not afraid. He also knew that he still wanted to return to Shushan. There were some things that he had to return to settle clearly. Previously, he was expelled and was in a pitiful state. He had to return in good shape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beishan Mo snorted. His voice was very soft. He sniggered and said, “I didn’t expect you to have such courage. You really surprise me. Then I’ll let you know two more things. First, Big Sister Nangong and me will be returning to the Reincarnation Realm soon. We’ll stay there for about two to three years. If not for the urgency to return to the Reincarnation Realm, I could wait for you at Shushan now. But this is also good. This gives you three years to prepare. You’ll have no excuse to say that I’m being unfair. In these three years, I’ll have tons of time alone with Big Sister Nangong. Don’t be too envious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Reincarnation Realm again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was indeed a little stressful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because Nangong Wei had gone to the Shushan Reincarnation Realm that her power had increased dramatically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, it was most likely that she would experience a great improvement as well. There was no way of predicting what level they would be at in three years when they meet Wu Yu at Shushan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was other people’s opportunity. Wu Yu was not envious. He was not afraid either. There was three years for him to prepare. He could do many things, and these would not be weaker than the Shushan Reincarnation Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then congratulations.” Since he would have the chance to make his move in three years, he would not be anxious to do it now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beishan Mo laughed. He was also cheery and handsome. His lips pressed together and he said, “The second point. I’ll try my best to set the date Big Sister Nangong and I will become dao companions after the battle. If you don’t die, you can have the honor of attending, to witness the ritual and process. Perhaps it may bring some epiphany to you. Don’t you think that I’m very thoughtful?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t have too many of these kinds of daydreams.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Beishan Mo, you are not a three-year-old kid, so don’t speak to me like a three-year-old kid,” Wu Yu said his last sentence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had confirmed their battle. It was useless to say too much to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They would see what would happen three years from now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After saying this, he retreated to the back. Huangfu Pojun knew what he meant and blocked Beishan Mo. He told the three martial cultivators from Shushan, “The three of you, since the three year agreement is confirmed, and Wu Yu has agreed, please go back now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go.” The Lunar Flower Sword Sage was already very satisfied with how the day had unfolded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She also did not expect Beishan Mo to help her so much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three of them took one last look at Wu Yu and left, their faces expressionless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little Mo, thank you for today. That Wu Yu may have a strong character, but he has that one weakness and you grabbed it so easily. Everything depends on you three years from now. There shouldn’t be any problems, right?” The Distant Fire Sword Sage was truly grateful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Lunar Flower Sword Sage said, "Nonsense, he and Wei Er are going to the Reincarnation Realm again. The Seven Immortals of Shushan spent a lot of energy to develop them, especially Little Mo. Three years from now, they will come out of the Reincarnation Realm. They will probably reach a level close to a Sword Sage. Wu Yu was born with a deficiency, and may not have received the greatest attention in Shushan. Let alone three years, even if it's 10 years, he won't be Little Mo's opponent."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beishan Mo smiled lightly and said modestly, "You two, don't be polite with me. Of course Wu Yu is really powerful and has infinite potential. But I will try my best to give you two a proper explanation. Of course, it's also for myself. Can you two understand?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Lunar Flower Sword Sage nodded and said, "Of course. That kid Wei Er just can't understand who is the most suitable person for her."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the three left, many Yan Huang Immortal Soldiers surrounded Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Commander, that Beishan Mo is too sneaky! You must not lose to him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What the heck, I really want to slap him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That guy will definitely spread news of this and pressure you so that you have no choice but to turn up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you don’t go, you’ll definitely be humiliated and will never be able to stand tall again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone had their piece to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huangfu Pojun said, “Let’s stop talking about this. Wu Yu knows his chances. There is no need to worry. Since he made this decision today, he’ll definitely let the Shushan Immortal Sect lose wholeheartedly in three years! Everyone, stop talking about this. Let’s disperse and start our guarding mission! Disperse!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While they were concerned for Wu Yu, under the order of General Commander Huangfu, everyone still dispersed. However, everyone was still thinking about Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that ghostly cultivators no longer appeared here, Wu Yu had an easy time. He was training and refining his Jindan most of the time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huangfu Pojun stood beside him and said, “Actually, it is quite rushed too. Why don’t you return to Yan Huang Imperial City? You’ve done a lot for this mission. There will probably not be any more ghostly cultivators coming over.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, three years would pass by quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu shook his head and said, “That’s not necessary. Let’s do it by the book.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aren’t you anxious?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course not.” Wu Yu laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While this was something big and very sensational on the day itself, his heart was calm. Perhaps he had expected that he would one day return to Shushan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had to prove himself!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Today, it was just that he had confirmed the time of return!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three years!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not too long, yet not too short!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Very good, you are a man! I’m impressed. I hope that three years from now, there will be a good ending.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huangfu Pojun did not say too much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But this news would spread out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next two months, Wu Yu was not as anxious as everyone had expected him to be. On the contrary, he was not in a rush. He was actually quite relaxed and his progress was slow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His mission was completed peacefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Inner Sea Dao Sect took all the blue spirit ore mines and returned to Inner Sea Dao Sect, while Wu Yu and others sat in the Yan Huang Warship and returned to Yan Huang Imperial City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wu Yu left the team first. He had been waiting for this day for a long time. He wanted to go back to the Dong Yue Wu Kingdom and the Heavenly Sword Sect to take a look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he thought of all the disputes that he had faced, he missed his relatives, his master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had been away from home for a long time. He had to go back and take a look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huangfu Pojun thought that when he returned, he would immediately work hard to reach a higher level and prepare for the fight in three years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not expect Wu Yu to not be in a hurry. Also, he would not return back to Yan Huang Imperial City as of yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright, let's go first."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he saw the Yan Huang Warship going off in the direction of Yan Huang Imperial City, Wu Yu went from the East Sea to the Dong Yue Wu Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing on the sea, looking at the vast land ahead, it would not be long before he reached the Dong Yue Wu Kingdom, where he was born.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'd better find my sister and ask her to help me out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I don't know if she will laugh at me after hearing these troubles I'm suffering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"In fact, there is no difference between a martial cultivator and an ordinary man. They will still have the seven emotions and six desires. We can't do without fighting. I just don't know if it will still be like this after I become an immortal."</span></p>
