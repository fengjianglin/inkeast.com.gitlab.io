 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To ensure a great Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial, the Shangyuan Dao Sect had to bear a certain level of stress.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was, the most awkward matter would be that based on the rules of the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial, the number one from 50 years ago had to be stationed here and be the host of this grand event. This was the individual Qin Shengxue, who won it all previously. However, he was no longer part of the sect and had become the Eighth Hell Emperor....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a blight for the Shangyuan Dao Sect, and there was nothing they could do about it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, what was more heartening was that the Taixu Sage Master would be stationed personally to receive the guests for this iteration. With him around, it was clear that this iteration of the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial would only be grander and more serious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, there were indeed several famous people who would be participating!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was especially so from the side of the demons. All three demons were astonishing and had distinguished identities. To put it bluntly, the fight for glory between the human race and demons would just be a contest for face. Both parties would still pay high attention to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battle ground would be located at the core location of the Shangyuan Immortal Mountain, the Upper Immortal Battle Ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Upper Immortal Battle Ground was a battle ground similar to the Battlefield of Old used for the Trial of Yan. However, it was broader and had rocks, steel, rivers, streams, mountains, and many other natural features. This was a natural battle ground and would allow participants to freely execute their dao techniques. They could choose to fight in the air or ground, manipulate the rivers and streams, upheave the mountains, and countless other possibilities!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Above the Upper Immortal Battle Ground, there was a huge, white jade platform hovering. That white jade platform was a kind of immortal treasure. There are several thousand people standing on it right now. Around the Upper Immortal Battle Ground, several tens of thousands of the Shangyuan Dao Sect disciples had gathered. As the hosting party, this was the advantage they had. They could have more people on the ground to support and cheer on their participants.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sometimes, the support could turn out to be immensely powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for those on the white jade platform, they were the core cultivators of the Shangyuan Dao Sect. With the Taixu Sage Master as the leader, countless cultivators had gathered with many experts among them. They were basically all wearing a standardized white robe with immortal vibes circling around them. It was as though they were a group of immortals that had emerged from the immortal realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Yi's Warship hovered opposite to the white jade platform. Yan Huang Immortal Army and the cultivators of the Shangyuan Dao Sect had vaguely formed a face off. As for the Taixu Sage Master, he wore a faint smile and spoke to the Imperial General across the air. Although they had fought side by side in the Battle of Ghosts and Gods, they could be seen as on opposite ends currently. Naturally, they would seem confrontational.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Taixu Sage Master said, "Imperial General is leading the team today. Why isn't the City Lord here? Is he afraid that the younger generation of Yan Huang Imperial City won't achieve anything and is ashamed of showing himself here?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was that he knew exactly what Yan Huang City Lord was guarding against....&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial General gave a creepy smile and said, "Sage Master, you have overthought. It's mainly because he's afraid that the Shangyuan Dao Sect will lose too pathetically. Sage Master would then be too ashamed to talk to him; therefore, he chose not to come so as to not embarrass you."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The provocative and sarcastic remarks from the two elite characters had triggered the confrontational desires of the younger generation. The truth was that the two of them were just teasing each other. At least for the recent 100 years, the Shushan Immortal Sect, Yan Huang Imperial City, and the Shangyuan Dao Sect were on good terms. It was especially so for the Yan Huang City Lord and the Taixu Sage Master as they knew each other well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Taixu Sage Master responded, "As for how the battle will really turn out, no one can know, and our words are meaningless. More importantly, it will be based on the performance of the younger generation. Let's hope that when the time comes, the Imperial General won't leave in a hurry. You have to remain on the Shangyuan Immortal Mountain for some days so you can let this old man be a good host."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're right! The performance of the younger generation is paramount. After everything ends, I'll definitely let the Sage Master pay for our expenses. However, don't get anxious, Sage Master. The next time we organize the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial, our Yan Huang Imperial City will definitely be a good host for the Sage Master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both of them teased each other and were actually just making jokes about each other. However, the younger generation from both parties were highly confrontational and started glowering at each other. There were even several hundreds of thousands of Shangyuan Dao Sect disciples who felt offended and started cursing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From this, one could tell how grand the once-every-50-years Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu also saw the participants on the other end. Other than Ji Lingshuang, whom he recognized, the other two were over 40 years old. One was a seventh tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator but was known to be able to challenge those stronger than him. The other was an eighth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator. Both of them would likely be at a level similar to Shen Qiuyan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To sum it up, other than Wu Yu's battling prowess, which the crowd wasn't too certain about, the Shangyuan Dao Sect appeared to have an edge.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, a dark horse making his way to the end was common in the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial. As there was only a single champion, the results were still extremely uncertain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Yan Huang Imperial City entered the Shangyuan Immortal Mountain first, the groups from various other sects arrived one after another and stopped above the Upper Immortal Battle Ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was that they had arrived at the vicinity long ago. However, no one dared to be the first to come in. After all, the first group to come in had to meet the Taixu Sage Master face to face. That stress wasn't something a second-rate sect could take.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Yan Huang Imperial City had entered, the sect leader of Gusu Fairy Peak led roughly 300 people in. There were all girls, and every single one of them was beautiful and captivating. One could lose their attention just by staring at this group of girls. Every single one of them was like a fairy and was beautiful in their own way. Although there were roughly 300 of them, each of them had their own disposition.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They came on a huge, pink lotus flower. The scent of the lotus was strong and assailed the nostrils of the crowd. This was an immortal treasure that was forged from a type of immortal essence. Ordinary immortal treasures used precious treasures as the main ingredient, and it was much harder to forge immortal treasures using immortal essences.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Yi's Warship, the white jade platform, and the lotus flower took one corner each. Naturally, compared to the two humongous forces, Gusu Fairy Peak was still a little inferior.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the peak master of Gusu Fairy Peak was also a Primordial Spirit Transformation Realm expert. Her name was Gusu Qinglian, and she was probably similar in age to the Imperial General. She had a well-endowed figure that was hard to find on young girls. Wu Yu had not seen a more captivating lady of her age, and even the Imperial General couldn't help but steal a few glances at her….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gusu Fairy Peak was also brave and had raised a young female genius. Her name was Gusu Yudie, and she was the niece of Gusu Qinglian. She was raised by Gusu Qinglian from young with all sorts of care and attention. At a young age, she was already a sixth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator. It was said that she possessed a top-tier legacy, and it was because she had inherited this legacy that she had reached this stage. Gusu Yudie rarely left Gusu Fairy Peak and therefore no one knew the legacy she had inherited.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among the 300 people, Wu Yu had spotted Gusu Yudie on first sight. She was indeed young and roughly the same age as Nangong Wei. In a place like Gusu Fairy Peak, her looks wouldn't be too poor. Just as expected, she was captivating and had a young, bubbly, and cute disposition. This was completely different from what her melancholic name might suggest. Instead, she looked full of vitality and gave off the vibe that she was fond of running and jumping around. Her bright eyes were looking around in awe, as though she was curious about everything around her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wu Yu noticed that when she saw Ji Lingshuang from the Shangyuan Dao Sect, a strong desire to battle gleamed in her eyes with evidence of provocation. This wasn't an ordinary desire to battle. Clearly, she had seen Ji Lingshuang as her greatest enemy. Wu Yu didn't know if there was a story behind it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Lingshuang looked at her and couldn't help but frown.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"A person that betrays her roots and changes her surname!" From the shape of her lips, Wu Yu seemed to have deciphered what she was saying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that he was baffled, the Imperial General explained, "Are you curious? The truth is that not many people knew about this matter. The real surname of the Taixu Sage Master is ‘Ji,’ same as Ji Lingshuang. That wasn't Ji Lingshuang's surname in the past. Her birth name was Gusu Lingshuang, and she's the biological sister of Gusu Yudie. However, she displayed outstanding talent when she was young and was adopted by the Taixu Sage Master. She isn't considered as someone from Gusu Fairy Peak anymore. There aren't many people who know this. Don't spread it recklessly."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was shocked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were biological sisters! It was not surprising that they both had such outstanding talent. This should have something to do with genes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As such, Gusu Yudie saw Ji Lingshuang as one who had betrayed Gusu Fairy Peak. Therefore, hatred filled her eyes and she had her eyes on the proud girl of the Shangyuan Dao Sect as her objective at all times. Perhaps the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial would be the best opportunity to prove herself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were all sorts of people with stories....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Gusu Yudie stared at Ji Lingshuang with a strong desire to battle, other sects, like the Heavenly Ares Sect, Imperial Thunderbolt Palace, and others, arrived one after another. Every team was led by their sect leader, with 300 of the strongest experts tagging along to support. This was a battle for glory and face. Basically, almost every sect had their strongest experts all here. Only during the Battle of Ghosts and Gods would one find as many experts in the same place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once every 50 years. If a second-rate sect like them could emerge victorious, that would truly be make history and shock the divine continent. Therefore, they would fight more desperately than elite sects like Yan Huang Imperial City during each Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial. Historically, there were cases of them emerging as the eventual champions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As time passed, various teams arrived. Although the Shushan Immortal Sect was located in the faraway south-west, they descended on the Shangyuan Immortal Mountain two days after the arrival of Yan Huang Imperial City. The thousand-strong group steered a ginormous sword onto the sky above the Shangyuan Immortal Mountain. In the direction where they were heading, two to three sects couldn't help but make way for them. After all, the edge of the huge sword wasn't held back and no one dared to block the way of the sword cultivators from the Shushan Immortal Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wei was here too.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu instantly perked up and looked up towards the giant sword. Five of the Seven Immortals of Shushan were here. Other than the Dubhe Sword Immortal and the Merak Sword Immortal, the rest were here. Naturally, the Mizar Sword Immortal had accompanied his daughter here. Numerous other Shushan Sword Sages were here too. Among which, the most attention-grabbing would be the Galaxy Sword Sage. If not for the fact that the Galaxy Sword Sage was unlucky and happened to be over 50 years old, he would definitely be one of the favorites to win it all!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ninth tier of Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea Realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu also saw Nangong Wei. She should be ready and should have the determination to make it through the battles. There was an edge and the will of the sword around her, and she seemed to have inherited the traditions of Shushan. Nine-colored flames raged in her eyes, and it seemed like some power had been awakened within her.&nbsp;</span></p>
