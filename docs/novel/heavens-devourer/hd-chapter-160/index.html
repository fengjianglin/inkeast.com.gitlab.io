 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the Heavenly Sword Sect could be found nine individuals with a cultivation level above the ninth tier of the Qi Condensation Realm. All of them were manning the 10,000 Swords Formation. As they had to keep the formation up, they were unable to directly take part in the fighting.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Previously, Wu Yu, at the sixth tier of the Qi Condensation Realm, was able to vanquish individuals at the eighth tier of the Qi Condensation Realm. But even if he were to help to take control of the 10,000 Swords Formation, he would be unable to affect the battle significantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As it stood, the Zhongyuan Dao Sect had retreated from the battlefield. Only the demons and Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts were left. Feng Xueya was still able to hold back their strongest cultivators as a result. This was Wu Yu's best opportunity to wade into the formation and have a go at slaughtering the opponents!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the Heavenly Sword Sect's side, only he had the possibility of tipping the scales, as he had managed to beat Jiang Ji on his own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, within the 10,000 Swords Formation also lay the Ninth Spirit, Tian Yijun, Shen Erjun and the rest of the Seven Ghosts who could potentially suppress him, but they were held off by the duo of Feng Xueya and Lan Huayi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This perilous situation was definitely much more risky compared to the first time Wu Yu had raided the Zhongyuan Immortal Mountain. If he was not careful, he might be caught by someone of the tenth tier of the Qi Condensation Realm, and he would definitely be in dire danger if that happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wouldn't even need to be killed. So long as he was used as a hostage, with Feng Xueya's character and Wu Yu's deemed importance, this would definitely lead to a rapid devolvement of the situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this was the fourth instance where Wu Yu had decided to act. The previous three times, he had managed to achieve significant gains and had even bought extra time for the Heavenly Sword Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, when he raised the idea of entering the 10,000 Swords Formation to fight, Feng Xueya had only mused for a moment before he gave instructions to the people around him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Zhongyuan Dao Sect has retreated, so let us use our full strength to assist Wu Yu and kill all of those ghostly cultivators and demons!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yes!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a blink, the nine elders were fired up. Their hopes were all laid on Wu Yu to change the stalemate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night Wishes for Snow and the rest were each holding on to a Zhongyuan Dao Sect disciple, using their bodies as a shield to deter Jiang Xie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Turning back, all of the Heavenly Sword Sect's cultivators were looking at him excitedly. Their unshakable belief had been placed on him. With all of the sect's hopes pinned upon him, Wu Yu felt even more resolute as he was determined to massacre their enemies!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Everyone..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu did not waste words. He drew his Onyx &amp; Pearl Dao Sword and split it into two before pushing off with great speed. It was as though he had transformed into a whirlwind as he dashed right into the midst of the 10,000 Swords Formation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya and the rest were still controlling the formation. They possessed a combat strength that was approximately that of the opponents. Without Jiang Xie's presence, they would be able to temporarily assist Wu Yu. The moment Wu Yu stepped into the formation, massive amounts of sword qi swirled around him, opening a path and protecting him at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This turbulent wave of sword qi made Wu Yu extremely confident and brave!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was him fighting alongside Feng Xueya and the elders!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within him, he grasped the sword cultivators’ hopes and dreams!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Heavenly Sword will not die! The sword qi is peerless!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I, a sword cultivator, will execute demons and devils! Overturning danger, I shall not fear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Slaughter the demons and retreat! Even the ghostly gods will cry!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the 10,000 Swords Formation were six ghostly cultivators and seven demons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the group of ghostly cultivators, three were at the 10th tier of the Qi Condensation Realm, and within the group of demons, three were at the tenth tier of the Qi Condensation Realm and greater. One of which was the Ninth Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Other than those six, the rest of the seven were individuals at the ninth tier of the Qi Condensation Realm or below. This also included Qi Yunji at the ninth tier of the Qi Condensation Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These seven were Wu Yu's targets!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had spread out within the 10,000 Swords Formations, all of them looking for an opportunity to find a weakness within the formation. Thus, they were not very close to each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the Disorienting Mist Formation had been dismantled, the 10,000 Swords Formation still stood strong. Sword qi suffused the air, and Wu Yu was also camouflaged by the qi surrounding him. Even if the opponents wanted to find him, it would not be an easy task!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"As of today, I am no longer my own. I embody the fervor of my thousand fellow disciples. My master and elders have paved the way to protect me. Today's Wu Yu has become a resolute weapon of the Heavenly Sword Sect!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu has entered.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"A newborn calf does not fear the tiger, and this brat has entered the 10,000 Swords Formation to fight us. Since Jiang Xie has retreated, this is their opportunity to counterattack!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Indeed. This is their one chance to make a comeback," said the Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We will beat them at their own game. Space out, but do not stay too far apart. When Wu Yu appears, just tie him down for a moment and the rest will quickly come to assist!" The group of them guffawed. They had already come up with a plan to deal with Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that Jiang Xie did not dare to advance, they were unable to tap upon his help. Luckily, Wu Yu had brazenly delivered himself to them. Capturing him would be the key to accelerating the Heavenly Sword Sect's demise!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The demons were also eyeing Wu Yu as he entered the 10,000 Swords Formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What should we do, Ninth Spirit?" The Ninth Spirit gave a coquettish laugh. "Jiu Er's Wu Yu has already reached the seventh tier of the Qi Condensation Realm. He has almost achieved the target I have set for him. At this point in time, he definitely must not land in the hands of the others. To Jiu Er, Wu Yu is even more important than this battle. Thus, we have to first capture Wu Yu. After all, he belongs to Jiu Er."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We understand. Everyone, spread out. Lure him into attacking us!" the Thunder Seabird said as his eyes flashed with lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had captured Wu Yu twice before, and he was confident that he would be able to do so again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had been worried that their group would stick together, but how could he ever have imagined that all of the opponents would spread out instead?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"All of them are trying to bait me to attack them?"</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wu Yu smiled. They truly underestimated him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, they did not spread out too much. At a moment’s notice, their formation could turn into an encirclement and they would quickly reinforce one another. To Wu Yu, this was definitely a massive danger and threat!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had to gamble his life for a glint of success.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, the cultivation of the Dao required one to constantly gamble upon their own life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Attack!" With the support of the 10,000 Swords Formation, he quickly rushed towards the demons and ghostly cultivators. Meanwhile, the two groups had temporarily stopped attempting to break the 10,000 Swords Formation and redoubled all of their efforts onto Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ninth Spirit..." Within the 10,000 Swords Formation, Wu Yu was most afraid of the Ninth Spirit. Thus, his first target was the ghostly cultivators. The demons and the ghostly cultivators had separated into two sides, and this would at least prevent the Ninth Spirit from catching him as quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ninth Spirit, he has headed towards the ghostly cultivators," the Thunder Seabird said, dissatisfied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ninth Spirit only gave a small smile. "There is no rush. The ghostly cultivators cannot restrain him. Once he has become drunk on might, he will definitely come and find us on his own accord." They did not move; it was as though they were watching a show. However, it could be seen that the Ninth Spirit was also repositioning her group, seemingly to block off Wu Yu's path of retreat into the Bipo Mountain Range. She was determined to win against Wu Yu at all costs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The focus of the fight lay upon Wu Yu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To the ghostly cultivators and demons, all they could see was a dense amount of sword qi. At this point in time, they chose not to attack. Furthermore, a significant amount of the sword qi was used to guard and wreath Wu Yu. With Wu Yu's high speed movements, it was hard for them to discern and lock down upon his position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For the remaining six individuals of the Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts, other than Qi Yunji and the fifth Ghost, Wu Shengjun, who stuck closely together, the other four had spread out. However, the three strongest, Tian Yijun, Shen Erjun, and &nbsp;Yu Sanji, were in the tenth tier of the Qi Condensation Realm and thus Wu Yu would not target them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three of them had separated into the three points of a triangle, ready to swoop down upon Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rest of the Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts, Si Fangji, Wu Shengjun, and Qi Yunji, were all surrounded by them in this large formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within this, Qi Yunji and Wu Shengjun were together. Wu Shengjun wore a cloak, so one could not see what he looked like. His body physique looked quite similar to Wu Yu's. He was quite well proportioned and his hands grasped a blood-colored iron chain. It looked as though it was crafted from the bones of men. It was definitely an immortal treasure, and it even seemed to be reeking of the smell of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Qi Yunji, Wu Yu had already met her previously. However, when they first met, Wu Yu was not her match.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The 10,000 Swords Formation's sword qi whistled by and the group was a little on edge. The Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts started to glance furtively at their surroundings, especially those below the tenth tier of the Qi Condensation Realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unexpectedly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Shengjun saw the sword qi in front of him roil and erupt! Within the midst of that tide of qi, he was able to catch a glimpse of Wu Yu's shadow!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He's here!" Wu Shengjun screamed loudly. The blood-colored iron chain began to dart around in his hands. It was as though it was a giant, blood-colored snake, moving explosively in front of Wu Yu's eyes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh, whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yin Yang Sword Wheel's dual sword killing strike!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had come to kill people, not spout rubbish. He rushed forward and utilized the Nascent Yin Yang Single Sword Strike with both his swords!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Crack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first sword qi had only managed to pierce the giant, blood-colored snake. Wu Shengjun was merely shocked, but he immediately sighed in relief. Yet once that sword qi dissipated, he could only see yet another Nascent Yin Yang Single Sword Strike arc past his shoulder, almost skewering him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ah!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He suddenly heard a loud cry of pain behind him. Wu Shengjun's heart skipped a beat as he turned around quickly. In front of his eyes, he saw Qi Yunji's mantle fall off, a single streak of blood between her eyebrows. Her eyes were wide open, staring at him in despair before collapsing onto the ground!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qi Yunji, dead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu!" bellowed Wu Shengjun. Yet before he could retaliate, the sword qi roiled and Wu Yu disappeared in front of his very eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In another blink, Tian Yijun and the other two had rushed to him, but Wu Yu had already disappeared, leaving only Wu Shengjun behind. Qi Yunji had already turned into a corpse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The 10,000 Swords Formation is assisting him!" He had seen Wu Yu's might for himself. The Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts were feeling a slight tinge of regret. They had not imagined Wu Yu to be so ferocious and terrifying. Even though they had arrived as quickly as they could, he had already disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We will definitely lock him down next time!" Shen Erjun exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yes!" Wu Shengjun could feel cold sweat all over his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He's here!" All of a sudden, another voice shouted out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is bad!" Tian Yijun exclaimed in shock. Wu Yu had already expected that their group would would want to surround him. After he killed Qi Yunji, with the support of the 10,000 Swords Formation, he knew the exact position of all the others. Since he knew that everyone else had come to Wu Shengjun's aid, he would definitely have taken advantage of the situation and strike at Si Fangji!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tian Yijun and the rest immediately rushed to her aid!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was hiding amidst the sword qi. When he neared Si Fangji, it was as though the entire formation had been focused upon her location. First, Si Fangji would have to protect herself against the tempestuous sword qi of the formation while Wu Yu hid right in the eye of the storm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Feng Xueya's assistance, this fight was completely lopsided to his advantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Si Fangji's mantle had long been shredded by the sword qi. Si Fangji's looks were even more moving compared to Qi Yunji's. Her body was exceptional, possessing a unique beauty that belonged only to the people of the East Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, to Wu Yu, she was just an enemy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kacha!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the midst of the sword qi, the two twin swords combined together and, before the eyes of the fearful enemies, Wu Yu demonstrated his dao technique. With the strength of his fleshly body, he raised his Onyx &amp; Pearl Dao Sword!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Great Dao of the Golden Sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sword qi rushed into the skies and agglomerated into a gigantic, golden sword. It was as large as a sword-shaped mountain! Golden light radiantly exuded in every direction as one's willpower ran amok looking at the grand sight. In Si Fangji's eyes, this was a golden sun that had suddenly risen in the midst of the formation. At this point, that radiant light was so piercing, she could barely open her eyes! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chop!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A single chop with the aid of the 10,000 Swords Formation. Before Si Fangji could react, that explosive outburst had completely vanquished her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts had already lost three in battle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With that strike, Wu Yu was unable to take even a moment to loot her Sumeru Pouch and treasures before he rushed off. Right behind him were the three at the tenth tier of the Qi Condensation Realm, all determined to kill him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu has succeeded!" The Heavenly Sword Sect was going mad with joy at what had occurred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To the demons, the Ninth Spirit only gave a wry smile. "Now look. Being his first target isn't a good thing."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Does Ninth Spirit have any way to deal with him?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Of course. He is Jiu Er's treasured one. He can only return to Jiu Er's embrace."</span></p>
