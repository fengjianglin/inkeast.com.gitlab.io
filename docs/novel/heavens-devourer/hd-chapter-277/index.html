 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Huh?" Wu Yu had forgotten about these.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For martial cultivators, there were many ways to increase one's wealth. This included looking for treasures of the world and working for their sects. While outside of their sects, the real way to get rich quickly was to plunder the items of others.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the saying went: Killing was for seizing the treasures of others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people killed for the purpose of getting the treasures of others.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the person died, his belongings would eventually be taken by others. Therefore, in the world of dao, it was a natural thing for one to take away the belongings of the enemies he had killed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, if one were to just kill rampantly for their belongings, it would be considered a sin. Ordinary orthodox martial cultivators wouldn't resort to committing such sins.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was another type of circumstances. For example, there were thousands of cultivators that had died in Qingsang City and the Lan Ling Sect. Even if each one of them only had a little wealth, the sum would still be astronomical. However, they were all innocent victims. Wu Yu wouldn't lower himself to the point of searching them for their belongings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, even if he had done so, it wouldn't be seen as overboard. It was the same reasoning when Wu Yu was searching for treasures in the ancient battlefield previously. The fact was that if a person died, the treasures they held wouldn't mean anything since they couldn't bring them along to the afterlife.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Jiu Ying handed these Sumeru Pouches to Wu Yu, but Wu Yu waved his hand and said, "We got him together. I can't just take all of them."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To his astonishment, Jiu Ying threw these Sumeru Pouches into Wu Yu hands directly and replied, "The cultivation method of demons is different from humans. I have no use for most things from ghostly cultivators. If you take them back to Shushan, you might be able to exchange them for some merit points. Truthfully speaking, I have no use for these items. Moreover, I have a very high standing in the Endless Demon Seas. I'm sure you have guessed this. I can basically get as many resources like these as I wish."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His last sentence made Wu Yu feel really bottled up. The things that he had to risk his life to obtain were readily available to Nangong Wei and Jiu Ying, who enjoyed high standings. “</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I really can't compare to them in this aspect...“</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying was more decisive in making decisions. If Wu Yu were to hesitate further, he would likely throw them on the floor. Jiu Ying was able to tell that Wu Yu probably didn't enjoy a high status in Shushan. Otherwise, he wouldn't be here for this type of mission. This wealth was something that Wu Yu would really need.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since that was the case, Wu Yu didn't reject again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every single Sumeru Pouch was incomparably huge. Among which, one of the Sumeru Pouches held many corpses. He Taozi and others were also kept within it. The first thing Wu Yu did was retrieve their bodies. As for the valuables that were on them, Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain had probably separated them to another Sumeru Pouch he held.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dead deserved the most respect. Wu Yu placed their bodies down. One of them had already been eaten, leaving only four corpses. All Wu Yu could do now was wait for the people from Shushan before sending them back to Shushan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Recalling his meeting with them at the Violet Sun Sword Palace, they were looking down on him since the start. However, they had all become corpses. Destiny was really something that was hard to fathom.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu flipped through the other Sumeru Pouches briefly and was shocked by the contents. Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain had probably killed countless people. Adding the fact that he had no fixed accommodation, he probably carried all his valuables with him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His items were messy and Wu Yu couldn't get a good sense in the first instance. Among which, there were 10 spiritual immortal treasures. He Taozi's sword was also part of the collection. Moreover, there were various dao techniques for ghostly cultivators. As Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain was engrossed with spirit designs, there were several books on spirit designs. However, most of these spirit design books were evil and weren't suitable for Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were also various kinds of immortal essences, talismans, and precious treasures. For immortal essences, there was even quite a number of them with three spiritual marks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain didn't specialize in refining immortal medicines, he had over 3,000 Golden Essence Pills within several Sumeru Pouches. That was equivalent to 3,000 merit points! A portion of them probably came from He Taozi and the group. It was just that they had been mixed together and Wu Yu couldn't tell which belonged to whom, and separating them would be difficult.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clearly, Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain killed to plunder the treasures of others. However, he likely wasn't interested in the belongings of the martial cultivators in Qingsang City and therefore did not waste his time to collect from them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">3,000 Golden Essence Pills could be considered a large sum. Baili Feihong, who was much stronger than Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain, probably didn't have that many. After all, buying various immortal treasures and everyday training would exhaust these resources quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These 3,000 Golden Essence Pills had basically resolved Wu Yu's poverty issue. One should note that his reward for this mission was 500 merit points, which was considered very high.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain crafted spirit designs frequently, and this would exhaust Golden Essence Pills rapidly. It was a pleasant surprise to Wu Yu that he had maintained over 3,000 Golden Essence Pills with him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wu Yu remained calm. As He Taozi and the rest were Shushan disciples, based on the rules of the sect for disciples, those who died in battle shall have their valuables returned to Shushan. Therefore, Wu Yu estimated that he would likely have to return a portion of these resources.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not delve into the items left behind by Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain. This was because he knew that he was likely going to bid farewell to Jiu Ying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people from Shushan would be arriving soon. It wouldn't be safe for Jiu Ying to remain behind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying pursed his lips and said, "In that case, I shall get going now. Wu Yu, it's destiny that let us encounter each other in this place among the billions of lives in the world. Today, we shall bid goodbye to each other. Hopefully, we have the opportunity to meet again."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu replied, "We have a long future ahead. As long as we stay alive, we will definitely meet again. I just hope that we won't be enemies then."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying chuckled. He knew the distinction between them. One of them was a human, while the other was a demon. The two races were arch enemies. There were times that even they couldn't do as they wished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Rest assured. I won't kill you. I, Jiu Ying, will never attack a friend," Jiu Ying said resolutely.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"In that case, that's something I'm sure I can do too." Since the other party was so sure, Wu Yu wasn't afraid to make the same promise. Although there were many uncertainties for the future, he wasn't worried about them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying replied, "Truthfully speaking, I feel that you are an exceptional talent. Your name would definitely shock the world one day, and you will become one who will be known throughout the world. However, I'm not at all inferior to you. Therefore, we will definitely meet again. I shall not be sentimental here. Goodbye."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Living in this world, it was hard to find one who shared the same ideals as you.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Goodbye." Wu Yu clasped his right fist in his left palm, smiled faintly, and bade goodbye to Jiu Ying. It was evening time now. As the sunlight shone down, their shadows were elongated on the flattened piece of land.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Youth was a phase of passion and ignorance. How could they know about the tough days ahead and times when they couldn't do as they wished? The promises made today were probably a little too presumptuous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying turned around and left, while Wu Yu stood there, seeing him off.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was thinking of staying behind and waiting for the arrival of the people from Shushan after Jiu Ying left. After which, he would return with the people from Shushan. He planned to first use the large amount of Golden Essence Pills to strengthen his foundation and advance to the fourth tier of the Jindan Dao Realm when he got back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that time, his strength would be even more insane.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm starting to understand how horrifying the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal was. I have just managed to pick up a few skills of his and I've already reached this level...."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was filled with ambitions for the future. He was especially looking forward to reaching the fifth tier of the Jindan Dao Realm and activating his first Great Dao Mystique!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While immersed in his anticipation, Wu Yu felt a stifling pressure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unknowingly, he had a suffocating feeling at this instant. It was as though he had suddenly appeared in an extremely dangerous place while being completely helpless. He felt an extreme lack of security.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu!" Jiu Ying suddenly turned around. His face was as white as a sheet while looking at him with a horrified expression. At the same time, he roared, "Get away quickly!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu didn't react to him and felt that his thoughts had slowed down. At that instant, he didn't know what was happening at all. He looked at Jiu Ying with shock. Jiu Ying was very flustered. He wasn't even that flustered when facing Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the sky turned dark.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although it was near sunset, the night would only start descending an hour from now. However, the skies had turned completely dark all of a sudden, as though a lid had been placed over the skies directly. There wasn't any glimmer of light around. Even Wu Yu's glowing body had dimmed at this moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying looked at Wu Yu anxiously. However, Wu Yu noticed that Jiu Ying couldn't move at all. In fact, even his face had stiffened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, Wu Yu discovered that he couldn't move either.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No wonder he felt a complete lack of security. He couldn't even move now! Just like Jiu Ying, he was paralyzed to the floor. Naturally, this wasn't an effect of the Fixed Body Art. Instead, it was strength that far exceeded theirs which had suppressed them down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, we are finished. There's an existence that far exceeds your current level. It's almost at the level I was at in the past," Ming Long suddenly remarked disappointedly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Ming Long completed her sentence, Wu Yu seemed to have seen it. Behind Jiu Ying and amidst the dark skies, an incomparably huge shadow appeared. That shadow extended from the ground to the skies and was at least a thousand zhang long. It was curvy and resembled a snake. Wu Yu couldn't see clearly, but what he could make out were two green suns in the sky. Although he could see the green suns, no light was shining from them. The entire skies were still black.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, Wu Yu understood that those weren't suns but the eyes of the monster that had appeared suddenly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This lasted just a moment and Wu Yu and Jiu Ying started moving. They were being sucked towards the sky by a domineering power. Soon, Wu Yu found Jiu Ying and himself in a transparent ball of light. Jiu Ying was at the center of that ball of light, which also happened to include Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them couldn't move and were constantly being shifted to a position slightly below the two "suns." If Wu Yu was right, that should be the mouth of that monster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wu Yu noticed this, he was already right in front of the eyes of that monster. The green eyes in front of him were like an endless lake and possessed soul-shaking powers. Wu Yu didn't dare to meet the eyes directly. At this moment, the ball of light Wu Yu and Jiu Ying were in seemed to have been swallowed by the huge beast. They were floating in endless darkness. Finally, the stifling pressure dissipated and the two of them regained their ability to move. It was just that the transparent ball of light had restricted them. Clearly, no matter how hard they struggled, they wouldn't get out of this ball of light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying was flustered and screamed loudly, "Uncle Ba! You have swallowed my friend too! It's okay if you are bringing me back, but please let my friend out first!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the other party didn't respond.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Uncle Ba! Damn it! This dumbass without intelligence!" Jiu Ying's face was turning red from anger. After fiercely striking the ball of light a few times, he looked to Wu Yu helplessly and said apologetically, "I'm sorry. This is bad. I've probably harmed you…."&nbsp;</span></p>
