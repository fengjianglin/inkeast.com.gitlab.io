 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu didn't really understand the last few words of the Yan Huang City Lord.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was only a single opportunity for him to leave the divine continent relatively smoothly?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he wasn't thinking of inheriting the position of the Yan Huang City Lord or staying behind on the Dong Sheng Divine Continent - there seemed to be nothing else left for him to do. Moreover, he no longer seemed to be able to find an opponent who could threaten his life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, if he were to head to the Yan Huang Ancient Region right now, it wouldn't be much of a problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, it was just a matter of time before he left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the confusion in Wu Yu's expression, the Yan Huang City Lord explained, "If you want to rely on yourself to head to the Yan Huang Ancient Region through the seas, you have to first consider that the sea region between this place and the Yan Huang Ancient Region is extremely broad and vast. Within these sea regions, there are numerous terrifying storms that are even more savage and rampant than the East Sea Swirls. Even if you are able to identify the direction accurately, it will still be easy for you to be left in perilous situations and lose your sense of direction. If you encounter some dangerous areas, you might be trapped within them and never make it out. After all, there are still numerous mysterious regions left behind since ancient times within the sea regions."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the exact reason why many people had lost their lives within the seas. Therefore, the people of the Dong Sheng Divine Continent didn't know about how huge the world outside the divine continent was. The dangerous sea regions had isolated them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He continued, "The natural hazards of the sea regions are just a factor. The other greater risk factor would be the demons within the sea regions. Typically, demons within sea regions are in huge numbers with varying levels of strength. Most of them might just be small fish or shrimps and wouldn't be a match for you. However, as you move through the endless seas, you might enter the territory of some terrifying demons by accident. Once you are targeted, especially if it is by Primordial Spirit Transformation Realm demons, they would never let prey like you get away. After all, in the middle of the endless seas, they hardly ever get to see a cultivator. Typically speaking, the demons in the sea regions are exceptionally hostile against cultivators and demons from the land entering the endless sea. This is because they see the areas as their territories. The seas are just too wide. They are even several times the size of the Yan Huang Ancient Region. In the seas, ordinary cultivators find it hard to fight against the demons. Moreover, they are largely vengeful and move in huge numbers. Even the smallest demons would drive you crazy."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If that was so, the sea regions were indeed dangerous. It would be especially so for the sea regions leading towards the Yan Huang Ancient Region.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clearly, this was also a major factor that had stopped the communication between the divine continent and the Yan Huang Ancient Region. Otherwise, the majority of the people in the divine continent didn’t even know about the existence of the Yan Huang Ancient Region.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"To sum it up, if you were to head to the Yan Huang Ancient Region by crossing the sea regions, it would be extremely dangerous! The probability of you dying would be at least 50%. Moreover, there's a possibility of you being lost within the sea regions. The chances of you reaching the Yan Huang Ancient Region would be less than 10%."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's pathetic!" Upon hearing the explanation, it was clear to him that he would need to be at least the level where he could defeat opponents of the Primordial Spirit Transformation Realm before he could head towards that area.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it wouldn't be easy for him to defeat Primordial Spirit Transformation Realm experts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"However, there's a shortcut." The Yan Huang City Lord finally came to the crux.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was really detailed today and had helped open the door to a whole new world for Wu Yu. He had revealed the full picture of the human realm before his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu anxiously asked, "What's the shortcut?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang City Lord answered, "This is only because lady luck is shining on you and you are here at the right time. This shortcut only appears once every 50 years. Naturally, if you succeed, it will be much easier for you to reach the Yan Huang Ancient Region. If you don't, you can only fall back on the previous method I described."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu waited for the City Lord to explain in detail.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other party said, "There's a secret realm within the Jambu Realm, and no one has deciphered or understood how it was formed. Even those in the Yan Huang Ancient Region likely do not understand the secrets behind this secret realm. The name of this secret realm is the Taigu Immortal Path."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"From the name of the Taigu Immortal Path, could this be a path towards the Immortal Dao?" Wu Yu couldn't contain his curiosity as he blurted out his query.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Not exactly. However, it might be a plausible assumption. Who would really know the answer? The Taigu Immortal Path has always existed within the Jambu Realm. As for its exact location, no one really knows. However, the Taigu Immortal Path appears after every 50 years. Naturally, the doors to the Taigu Immortal Path appear across the entire Jambu Realm. Among which, it's obvious that the appearances of the doors would be the most densely packed across the Yan Huang Ancient Region. There might be over 100 doors. Based on records, the locations of the doors are fixed each time. Therefore, at the Yan Huang Ancient Region, their people always occupy the doors to the Taigu Immortal Path and arrange for their people to be sent in. Naturally, the doors also appear in the seas. There might even be several hundred doors in the seas. However, as the seas are too broad, there might be the possibility that a door towards the Taigu Immortal Path has appeared but has remained undiscovered. After speaking for so long, what I really want to tell you is that there is a door to the Taigu Immortal Path on our Dong Sheng Divine Continent too. Although there is only a single one, it is still there. Right?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were several hundred doors on the Yan Huang Ancient Region, but only one on the divine continent. It was not surprising that Wu Yu had never heard of the Taigu Immortal Path. After all, the numbers were too few.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A mysterious realm was surprisingly able to open doors on various corners of the entire Jambu Realm, creating the pathways towards this mysterious realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What form would that mysterious realm take? Could it be a world that intersected with the Jambu Realm?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu raised his concerns directly to the Yan Huang City Lord.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang City Lord answered, "As for what form the Taigu Immortal Path exists as, even the experts from the Yan Huang Ancient Region would be likely not capable of answering you. I couldn't be certain either."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"When the doors to the Taigu Immortal Path open and I enter one, could I then reach the Yan Huang Ancient Region by leaving through other doors?" Wu Yu guessed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang City Lord chuckled before saying, "That's the general idea. However, it is clearly not that simple. First, each door leading to the Taigu Immortal Path only allows one person to pass through. For example, if you enter the door, that door will disappear immediately. What I'm trying to say is that when a person enters through another door, that door disappears immediately too. Moreover, there isn't any exit within the Taigu Immortal Path. After you enter the mysterious realm, a talisman will fall into your hand instantly. When you crush the talisman, you will be sent back to the original location. For example, you would be sent back to the divine continent."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu exclaimed in shock. "It’s that magical? Why does it feel like someone is manipulating everything from within? Doesn't it sounds just like a game?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That is indeed so. The only shame is that after so many years, no one has found the person manipulating this game. Perhaps it is controlled by some ancient spirit designs. There could be endless possibilities with high-level spirit designs."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How could I reach the Yan Huang Ancient Region then? Could it be that I have to... snatch another person's talisman, crush it, and be sent back to the Yan Huang Ancient Region?" Wu Yu asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang City Lord nodded his head before speaking, "You are indeed smart and able to understand by just pointing you in the general direction. That's exactly what you have to do. Although I have not tried it personally, different talismans should correspond to different locations. As for whether you can succeed, it will depend on yourself. However, things aren't as simple. This is because if you lose your talisman, you will be trapped within the mysterious realm forever and never make it out. Therefore, everyone will see the talisman as the most precious thing to them. Have it ready at all times so that once a life-threatening event happens, or you encounter a situation from which you have to retreat, you can crush the talisman at the first instant and not let others have an opportunity to snatch yours.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Each person can stay within the Taigu Immortal Path for a year. When the time is up, the talisman will automatically be crushed and the person will be sent out. If you don't have a talisman at that time, most people would think that they could just snatch one from the new batch of entrants 50 years later. However, over the long history, there hasn't been a case where someone who had lost their talismans 50 years ago made it out. Basically, one thing we are sure of is that they have all gone missing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Therefore, you have to leave within a year through the talisman. For you, it would be best if you could snatch a talisman from someone who is from the Yan Huang Ancient Region. If you can't steel yourself, you can leave yours with him. In this scenario, you would be able to reach the Yan Huang Ancient Region successfully."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After giving the entire explanation some thought, although the whole matter sounded complicated, it was no more than finding a person from the Yan Huang Ancient Region, snatching his talisman, crushing it, and travelling to a new location.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was indeed a simple and effective method. As for the difficulty of execution, one would only know when the time was here. After all, he didn't know how strong the other party was. If the other party was weak, everything could be settled with the Fixed Body Art. If the other party was an expert, it would be tough. If he was unable to restrict the other party, the other party could leave directly by crushing his talisman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We refer to this talisman as the Taigu Immortal Talisman. You must be curious as to why I'm so informed about the matters of Taigu Immortal Path despite being in this deserted land, right?" The Yan Huang City Lord smiled warmly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu nodded his head as response.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's because I entered it when I was young.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"However, I didn't use this method to reach the Yan Huang Ancient Region at that time. When I finally made it to the Yan Huang Ancient Region, it was after I had reached the Primordial Spirit Transformation Realm. Moreover, the trip was exceptionally perilous and I almost lost my life. After spending some years there, the people of the Yan Huang Ancient Region sent me back to the Dong Sheng Divine Continent to guard the Yan Huang Ancient Region after learning about my identity. After all, they needed someone to stand guard at this place."&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Taigu Immortal Path was indeed a method to save time and energy. However, Wu Yu's interest was piqued. He asked, "Although this isn't really related to my decision to head to the Yan Huang Ancient Region, what can be found within the Taigu Immortal Path? Will there be people fighting to get in each time?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang City Lord heaved a sigh before saying, "This question isn't easy to answer. Based on rumors, the situation varies each time one enters it. That is a very mysterious place. Sometimes, you might find treasures the moment you step in. Sometimes, you might be in the center of dangers and catastrophes without any benefits at all. Sometimes, you will be sent into an environment with no end. Sometimes, you might be feeling that you have been thrown back in time to a long time ago.

Nonetheless, while you are in the Taigu Immortal Path, your chances of getting something are high.</span></p>

Sometimes, it might be easy to obtain elite-level treasures. The environment might be filled with immortal essences, or you may be sent to a battle arena in ancient times. I have heard of people easily getting a dozen-odd dao treasures after entering the place. I have also heard that some might suffer the wrath of nature the moment one enters the place. With over 1,000 people entering, at least 200 are killed directly. As for the rest, they only escape because they can crush their Taigu Immortal Talismans...."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was completely astonished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was actually a place like this?&nbsp;</span></p>
