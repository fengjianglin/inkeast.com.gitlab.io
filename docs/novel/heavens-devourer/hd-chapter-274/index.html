 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Enjoy it slowly. I did not tell you about the difficulty because I was afraid you wouldn't have chosen to come down. Now that you have, it's better to just work hard. Cough, cough...."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Towards the end, Ming Long didn't dare to say a word.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she started forging her Nanwu Treasured Moon Golden Vajra Body in the past, she was way different from the current Wu Yu. If she had felt it unbearable then, it would likely be worse for the current Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having just immersed himself into the lava, he could already felt that it was more terrifying than being submerged in molten metal. Although Wu Yu had forged the Vajra Buddha in him, he was struggling to keep himself alive. The pain of absorbing all the surrounding lava into his body to forge the third tier of Invincible Vajra Body was unimaginable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Throughout this process, the most important factor was probably not one's talent or one's understanding of the spiritual art. Instead, it had to be one's resolve and will to live on.Although that spiritual art was complicated, Wu Yu had a solid foundation. After reciting it a few times, he could already roughly understand the profound meaning behind it. The crucial thing was still how he could withstand and resist the Subterranean Treasured Moon Furnace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Treasured Moon."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking down from where Jiu Ying was, that golden pool of lava looked more like the round moon that was underground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two hours had passed and there was no sign of Wu Yu. If not for the fact that he could still sense Wu Yu's vitality, Jiu Ying would have assumed that Wu Yu had been reduced to dust within the lava.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I only know that he has a strong body. However, I never would’ve expected him to have achieved it through such forging methods. Cultivation isn't just about one's talent. One still has to have a will that is beyond that of ordinary men."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying was deeply influenced by Wu Yu. He couldn't imagine the torment that Wu Yu was experiencing right now amidst the lava. How could he resist the urge to charge out?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the depths of the lava, the surrounding lava had already started circulating, with Wu Yu as the center. The scorching heat of the surroundings had torched the majority of Wu Yu's flesh. In fact, some areas were left with only eerie-looking, white bones.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His skeletal structure looked as though it was forged with gold as the lava covered it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was that for the first half of the process, it wasn't forging, but modification. It was the preparatory phase and the most painful portion. It required the use of the spiritual art of the third tier of Invincible Vajra Body to modify one's body while one's body was being burned by the lava. At the same time, Wu Yu had to create billions of suction points on the surface of his body to absorb the surrounding lava, forming a net. The last step would then involve the perfect fusion of Wu Yu and the Subterranean Treasured Moon Furnace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luckily, this process wouldn't last too long if one could withstand it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it lasted a long time, the torture would be worse than death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even so, it was equivalent to the most brutal experience in the world. This greatly shocked Wu Yu and made him wonder how the Invincible Vajra Body was created in the first place....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Towards the end, he was almost numb to the pain, and he focused on systematically creating suction points.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had many reasons in mind that supported him to carry on. These included his desire to reach the peak of the Clear Sky of Shushan, his longing for the people of Heavenly Sword Sect, Wu You, who was in the palace in Dong Wu, and Nangong Wei, who was in the Shushan Reincarnation Realm. They had all become the driving forces behind him and enabled him to continue.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, his body was decorated with billions of golden dots.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Half a day had passed. Jiu Ying looked down and finally saw something different. At the depths of the lava, there seemed to be something that was shining even brighter, overwhelming the brilliant light of the lava. It was as though a sun was in the middle of it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides that, the still lava suddenly started raging and boiling as though there was someone boiling it from the bottom. During this process, the amount of lava seemed to be decreasing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, violent and coarse shrieks of pain and roars erupted with the boiling lava.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking from afar, the entire Treasured Moon Furnace was trembling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was as though a giant beast had awakened within it and was letting out a huge roar.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He has probably succeeded."&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying stopped his actions. After spending half a day, he still wasn't sure how far he was from the surface of the earth. At this moment, he had placed his hopes on Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What Jiu Ying was not expecting was that Wu Yu was trying to absorb all the lava into his body to forge a stronger and more horrifying physical body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For Wu Yu, this moment was similar to a phoenix rising from the ashes!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why was he shouting? That was because of the pain and the tough process.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this wouldn't stop him. His heart was filled with his desire to become a real immortal, the desire to become stronger, the responsibilities he felt towards the lives of mortals, and especially so, his hatred for Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain. This granted him endless willpower to succeed!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, he recalled a saying in the Heavenly Sword Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Martial cultivation is plunder. Only the strongest rule!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Martial cultivation was about plundering. Plundering the spiritual qi amidst heaven and earth, plundering the assets of others, and even plundering the essence within the lava. Everything that was powerful shall be plundered. And only by being strong could one achieve what he set out to do and roam the world with a heroic heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If one was weak, they could be killed easily by others. There was no purpose in heroism then.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of this, Wu Yu was exceptionally determined. No matter what he was enduring, he wanted to grow stronger and stronger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He couldn't let over ten thousand martial cultivators suffer such a tragic death, whether he knew them or otherwise.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, he out a huge roar and didn't slow down his pace at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang, bang, bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Below Jiu Ying, the lava splattered in the eruption. Some fell on him and started burning instantly, leaving a few bloody holes on him. Jiu Ying shrieked in pain and was clearly stunned. Through this experience, he finally understood that the lava below him wasn't ordinary. Its temperature was way beyond what he had imagined. If he were to fall in, he would likely be reduced to dust in a few breaths.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How did he do it?"</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Hearing Wu Yu's beast-like roar, Jiu Ying was confused.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, he noticed something too. The level lava below him was rapidly decreasing at a pace visible to the naked eye. As for the brilliant object in the middle, it was shining brighter and brighter. This undoubtedly suggested that Wu Yu was absorbing the lava to forge his body!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing above, he could see the round pool of lava getting smaller.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This guy is truly a demon-like genius amongst humans."</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Jiu Ying had never been impressed by others. However, he willingly accepted that he was inferior to Wu Yu this time. This wasn't in the aspect of talent, but in the aspect of one's will.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was, Wu Yu only gained this will and determination after being deeply influenced by the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal and having a few experiences where he struggled on the edge of life and death. It was especially so when he vividly experienced despair before escaping from death brought upon by the Heavenly Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since then, he was more determined than others for opportunities that might arise.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like this, Jiu Ying watched on as the entire round pool of lava shrank, being absorbed by Wu Yu. As for the location where Wu Yu was, it had become similar to a miniature sun. That blazing sun constantly sent out shockwaves of flames. In the eyes of Jiu Ying, Wu Yu was even hotter than the lava that was surrounding him previously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was that it wasn't a blazing sun that was formed on Wu Yu. Instead, it was a treasured moon. The moon in the sky was a weakened version of a blazing sun. It was just that the moon was similar to a blazing sun in the eyes of Jiu Ying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu, hu, hu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Flames raged and spread to the surroundings. A day had passed, and the entire Subterranean Treasured Moon Furnace had almost dried up. Jiu Ying was no longer afraid of falling into it. What replaced the pool of lava was Wu Yu, who had turned as bright as the full moon. Standing from afar, Jiu Ying could vaguely see Wu Yu sitting within the round pool. His eyes were closed as he rested, and one could vaguely sense an ongoing dramatic change to his physical body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The forging of the Nanwu Treasured Moon Golden Vajra Body had entered the last stage, or the consolidation stage. At this moment, all the pain and miseries had passed. This basically meant that Wu Yu had succeeded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As an outsider, Jiu Ying couldn't tell the miseries Wu Yu had endured and couldn't experience the horrifying struggles Wu Yu had been through over the day. However, he had a rough idea and was sincerely happy for Wu Yu at this moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What's more important is that with the lava gone, I don't have to worry about falling in. Perhaps I can destroy as I wish and smash open a path towards the surface directly."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Previously, the only worry he had was falling into the endless lava pool below. However, it was almost gone now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Wu Yu, he clearly picked up the pace. In about half an hour, the entire Subterranean Treasured Moon Furnace had been absorbed into his body. The current Wu Yu had snow-white skin decorated with golden lights. Looking from the outside, he didn't seem to have changed from before. However, his forging of the Nanwu Treasured Moon Golden Vajra Body was successful. Overall, he was completely different from before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking closely, he realized that there seemed to be a round moon behind him that was blinding. His body, skeletal structure, skin, meridians, bloodline, and head had been strengthened by over ten times. A wave of his hand could even shake the mountains and earth!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Wu Yu opened his eyes abruptly. Rays of light shot from his eyes towards the sky. At this instant, two paths that led towards the surface were blasted open. In just the time of a few breaths, he had opened paths that were even longer than what Jiu Ying had created over a day.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first release of the power accumulated in his physical body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, forging the Nanwu Treasured Moon Golden Vajra Body didn't just grant him a body strength that was ten times stronger than before, it also included various techniques. The piercing force of his eyes was just one of the techniques. From here onwards, Wu Yu estimated that no matter how strong his opponent might be, they would feel a strong sense of pressure if they looked him in the eye for long.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although his eyes were still black, the vitality and demeanor they exhibited were unparalleled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From top to bottom, as long as he exercised strength, the golden meridian network in his body would surface. What was most terrifying was that the fluid flowing within these golden networks was none other than the lava Wu Yu had absorbed a while ago. His current body held the entire Subterranean Treasured Moon Furnace currently. He could even eject lava from his mouth and burn a large number of Jindan experts to death if he wished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for his current cultivation level, he was still just a third tier Jindan Dao cultivator. However, the strength of Wu Yu's physical body exceeded even his own Jindan essence! For others, their Jindan essence would at least be 10 times stronger than their body. However, for Wu Yu, the strength of his body had exceeded his Jindan essence. He could be considered as one in a million in the world. For example, elite demons like Jiu Ying could only employ body strength that barely reached half of their Yaodan essence. Under most circumstances, the amount was closer to one-third.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, the quality of Wu Yu's white Jindan was exceptional too.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, Wu Yu didn't feel like he was a martial cultivator. Instead, he felt like he was closer to a martial artist of a higher level. The strength of his attacks wasn't from dao techniques. He could already fight by merely throwing bare punches or battle techniques. This was something extremely insane to even contemplate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He stood up and could immediately hear his bones cracking. Even Jiu Ying gasped upon meeting his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
