 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Killing his enemy in an instant, his sword had reached a new level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yin Yang Sword Wheel had truly taken the world by storm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was his first time using the Art of Sword Flight, and truth be told, Wu Yu was not at ease. But it was undeniable that the Art of Sword Flight was fast!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had broken them, and he whooped wildly, his clothes and black hair billowing freely in the wind!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the moment of sunset. Wu Yu's youthful arrogance, his deadly flight, his resolution. While they were still stunned, he fled towards the rays of the westerly sun, vanishing into its brilliance in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This moment had come too quickly, too suddenly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They only began to react when Mo Xiudao's corpse fell from the skies, slumping against the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unbelievably, Wu Yu was actually using the Art of Sword Flight!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many allowed their imagination to run wild. Could he truly be in the Jindan Dao Realm?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But if he truly was, then he would have no need to run like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The army of close to a thousand burst into action. The demons had been ordered into action by the Ninth Spirit. The Thunder Seabird leapt into the sky, transforming on the fly. His hands became wings of thunder, and his feet became sharp eagle claws. He sprouted purple feathers, his mouth elongating into a sharp beak!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a flash, he had changed from a human into the demonic Thunder Seabird's true form. Quick as lightning, he chased Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Given the Thunder Seabird's speed, perhaps only the Ninth Spirit and Jiang Xie could overtake him. And since he had gone, Jiang Xie did not go. After all, he was the sect leader, and this matter of pursuit would demean his reputation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pa.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He landed on the ground, with Mo Xiudao's corpse at his feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xiudao's death had crushed the Zhongyuan Dao Sect's disciples, exactly as Wu Yu had counted on. Their faces were ashen, and their spirits broken. They had been supremely confident about this conquest, and now they felt even more terrible than if they had been forced to eat shit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It seems like this challenge wasn't as easy as we expected...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Jiang Junlin and Mo Xiudao both died at Wu Yu's hands. What will the Sect Leader do?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was looking at Jiang Xie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the Thunder Seabird in pursuit, they did not believe that Wu Yu would actually get away. Casting their gazes far, they could make out on the horizon that the Thunder Seabird had already captured Wu Yu. They were struggling in the air, and Wu Yu failed to create another miracle. Against the overwhelming power of the Thunder Seabird's spiritual power, he was beaten soundly. Before too long, Wu Yu had the Onyx &amp; Pearl Dao Sword wrested from him. He was tased numb, and then brought back in the Thunder Seabird's claws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu could only grimace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Still helpless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, at least he had rubbed the Zhongyuan Dao Sect's face in the dirt and also bought more time. He had dealt a punishing blow to their morale!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Zhongyuan Dao Sect is good for nothing! With this poor strength, you want to conquer the Bipo Mountain Range! I think all of you are only fit to be servant disciples in my Heavenly Sword Sect, tending to our Immortal Cranes and beasts!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had been thrown against the ground by the Thunder Seabird, but still kept up his plucky attitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What are you looking at? If you have the balls, come and fight! Kiddos! Daddy Wu is always waiting for you. Come on if you have the balls, don't stand there all wishy-washy!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was truly a freak. His rate of improvement was sickening, even slaying Mo Xiudao. Under his rain of verbal abuse, many of the Zhongyuan Dao Sect disciples were stirred to anger again, but they were held in check by their fear. They did not respond in unison, and there was no one to lead them. It was difficult for them to respond, and they could only trade angry insults with Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Get in!" The Thunder Seabird was worried that Wu Yu would clash with them again, and hurriedly stuffed Wu Yu back into the palanquin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Zhongyuan Dao Sect, you are all pussies!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Wu Yu had been thrown back into the palanquin, his smug, scornful laugh still rang in their ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he was back in the palanquin, the Ninth Spirit's voice came floating out. Instantly, all the Zhongyuan Dao Sect disciples forgot their anger, held spellbound by the Ninth Spirit's charms. They listened, enthralled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother Jiang, the fights to the death that just transpired was your own agreement with Wu Yu. There are casualties, but you can't blame me, alright?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The voice was sultry with sex appeal, and it made one unable to stay angry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Logically, this was indeed Jiang Xie accepting Wu Yu's challenge. No one else could be blamed. Since he had said this was a battle to the death, then Mo Xiudao's death had to be accepted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And now everyone looked to see how Jiang Xie would respond.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ninth Spirit was bent on protecting Wu Yu, even willing to break the alliance with Jiang Xie. Now it depended on Jiang Xie - would he press the issue, or back down?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Xie silently collected the corpse of Mo Xiudao with a grim face. His stony eyes repressed the killing intent he felt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He said, "Disciples of the Zhongyuan Dao Sect, carry these corpses well. We set off for the Bipo Mountain Range! Today, a few of our members have died. Tomorrow, the Heavenly Sword Sect will repay us tenfold!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were reinvigorating words, and also indicated Jiang Xie's alliance with the Ninth Spirit. Of course, once the battle was truly over, it remained to be seen if Jiang Xie would let Wu Yu off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"A true gentleman knows when to bend. The truly frightening thing about this Jiang Xie is that he can continue to hold himself back when faced with such humiliation. Who knows what he will do hereafter," Tian Yijun, watching from above, commented to his brothers and sisters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Forget him. It's none of our business, heh heh...." Shen Erjun cackled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Plenty of our business. After the battle is over, my understanding of Jiang Xie tells me that he will ally with us to vanquish the Ninth Spirit," Tian Yijun said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"And how does Big Brother answer?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tian Yijun smiled slightly. "When the time comes, you will know."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The troop resumed its journey!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The masses of martial cultivators and the demon army resumed marching towards the direction of the Bipo Mountain Range! Amongst them, the disciples of the Zhongyuan Dao Sect were already bursting with anticipation. They wanted to repay the humiliation that Wu Yu had dealt them back to the disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inside the palanquin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu stood ramrod straight, facing the ultimate beauty Ninth Spirit. He was constantly chanting the Inner Vajra Buddha Sutra. Under these strenuous circumstances, he had already cultivated this numerous times. As long as he had nothing to do, he was chanting the Inner Vajra Buddha Sutra to build his body and the inner buddha, strengthening his Invincible Vajra Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At first, the mere pain was unbearable. But once he thought of the danger to the Heavenly Sword Sect, and Feng Xueya's own kindness towards him, he could bear it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sun Wudao's boon had not been repaid!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya's grace had to be repaid!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Presently, golden sigils were floating around Wu Yu's body as he faced the Ninth Spirit while cultivating. It was a startling sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, he stood and cultivated mainly to keep himself alert and unswayed by the Ninth Spirit's charms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Weng, weng, weng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each golden sigil cut through his body like a speedy knife. They cut swiftly, but then formed a golden rain that continued to build and toughen his body. It was like honing a sword or any other weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ninth Spirit was staring at him open-mouthed. She was not at all fazed by the events that had just occured, but instead stood with her hands on her hips, circling Wu Yu. After a while, her pure white hands slid up Wu Yu's shoulders, her perfect face pressed against the small of his back. Softly, she said, "I can hear that your body is constantly being strengthened. It must be so agonizing...."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had just used the Immortal Ape Transformation, and so he was wearing only pants, his upper body unclad. The contact of skin with the Ninth Spirit's face made him quiver. The sensation was sublime. Luckily, he was still incanting his sutra, and his body was in sufficient pain for him to hold on without losing his mind again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't touch me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu said, his eyebrows creased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No. Wu Yu is Jiu Er's lover. Only Jiu Er can touch Wu Yu." Ninth Spirit reached out a finger and rested it on Wu Yu's nape. She began to slide it down, and was almost at his bottom extremity when Wu Yu slapped her finger away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ninth Spirit, I know you are powerful. Today, this Wu Yu stands before you as helpless as a trussed up chicken. But don't make fun of me. Just say what you intend." Just being in the same room as her set his heart pounding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The manner of Yang Qing's death was still swimming in Wu Yu's mind. Each time Wu Yu was about to fall for he Ninth Spirit, it shocked him back awake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Jiu Er has already said. I just want you to love me. Jiu Er has waited for you for so long. You were my lover from a past life, and our fate was entwined. In this life, Jiu Er wants to dote on you too. I want to be by your side, and spend our lives together. Jiu Er knows that it is difficult for you to accept Jiu Er right now. But one day, you will love me.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ninth Spirit stared at him, speaking earnestly. The tears welling in her eyes made his heart go out to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're already a thousand years old. Can you not be like an old cow chasing young grass?" Wu Yu did not have much in the way of a reply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ninth Spirit laughed in a tinkling fashion. Her features were beautiful enough to make the flowers bloom. She reached out a tender finger, resting it against Wu Yu's neck. She stared at him with an enchanting gaze, smiling. "Jiu Er doesn't care. This old cow Jiu Er wants to pluck Wu Yu, the tender blade of grass."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu started. The Ninth Spirit was too cute, and he felt himself really falling for her. This was a feeling that Lan Shuiyue and Su Yanli had never made him feel before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm about to barf. Wu Yu, can you give her a good slap?" Ming Long's phantom suddenly appeared before Wu Yu. She frantically slapped the Ninth Spirit a few times. Of course, this did not really happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long did not know what this fox demon wanted either. Both of them were still clueless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was suddenly moved. "Ninth Spirit, after all this, there was something I wanted to talk to you about."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What is it you wish to talk to Jiu Er about?" The Ninth Spirit opened her eyes wide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Your purpose for attacking the Heavenly Sword Sect is simply for some cultivation resources, the likes of which the Zhongyuan Dao Sect has as well. Why not aid the Heavenly Sword Sect to defeat the Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts and the Zhongyuan Dao Sect? If you help us to destroy them, I will naturally be grateful, and will even leave willingly with you, of my own accord," Wu Yu said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ninth Spirit shook her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu continued, "I’ve killed Jiang Junlin and Mo Xiudao. Jiang Xie wants to kill me, but you protected me. Although Jiang Xie has not fallen out with you, he must hate you to the marrow right now. If you really take down the Bipo Mountain Range, he will definitely join forces with the Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts against you! So on the contrary, joining forces with the Heavenly Sword Sect is your only chance!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a clear point, and Wu Yu hoped that the Ninth Spirit would see his point of view.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But, unexpectedly, the Ninth Spirit still shook her head.</span></p>
