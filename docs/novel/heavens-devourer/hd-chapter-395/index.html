 <p dir="ltr"><br></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Those who can find all his doppelgangers and his real form will be rewarded!" Cangxue Qingfeng chuckled. At that instant, millions of Fiery Flame Fishes suddenly dispersed and swam out in all directions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When these Fiery Flame Fishes moved, they were just like flowing flames at the bottom of the seas. When over a million of them moved together and away in all directions, that scene was majestic!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A huge ruckus was created over the entire sea region because of these Fiery Flame Fishes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment Wu Yu sensed his doppelganger being destroyed, he knew danger was upon him. A short distance away from that destroyed doppelganger, there were a few more doppelgangers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the Fiery Flame Fishes had swarmed out from where the Black Fiend was at before. It was easy for Wu Yu to conclude that they were under the control of Cangxue Qingfeng and were sent to look for him and his doppelgangers. The number of Fiery Flame Fishes was truly astronomical. Wu Yu couldn't possibly hide!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking the doppelganger near him as an example, the first instant he was spotted by a Fiery Flame Fish, it released a shrieking scream. The next instant, over 1,000of them surrounded him. Clearly, the Fiery Flame Fishes were informing Cangxue Qingfeng. Soon, Cangxue Qingfeng appeared before that doppelganger, with the Black Fiend closely behind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Fiend had a black sword in his hand. He moved like a bolt of lightning, broke through Wu Yu's sword technique, and instantly annihilated the doppelganger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's still a doppelganger! However, this discarded disciple from Shushan won't last long if this goes on," said the Black Fiend harshly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu naturally knew that he was in grave danger. In fact, his life was at risk. Even if he had dispersed his doppelgangers at this point, he probably wouldn't be able to escape the search area of the Fiery Flame Fishes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luckily, Wu Yu was much faster than the Fiery Flame Fishes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As long as he wanted to escape, he still could do so. With circumstances turning out as such, Wu Yu had no chance of winning against the two of them alone. Therefore, he chose to retreat directly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As such, he quickly retracted his doppelgangers back before the Fiery Flame Fishes noticed him. The golden hairs also returned to his body after the doppelgangers were killed. After expending some time to gather all his doppelgangers, Wu Yu fled instantly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I guess I can only seek reinforcements from Huangfu Pojun. With Cangxue Qingfeng interfering, it would probably be hard to hold our ground over the blue spirit ore mine."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He moved through dense layers of sea water, and huge waves were a short distance away from him. These were probably caused by the Black Fiend and Cangxue Qingfeng. They had started chasing him after discovering that he had collected his doppelgangers and was escaping.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, aren't you here to kill me? Why are you running away now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Weren't you acting arrogantly a while ago? Why are you running away with your tail between your legs?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Fiend taunted Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If you run away now, all your kin and friends will be in danger. Can you imagine what I will do to them? You should be aware of the means ghostly cultivators like me possess. Believe me, you will definitely be infuriated."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Fiend's words were truly mean and ruthless. Any young cultivator with soaring passion would have turned around eventually be easily killed by the Black Fiend and Cangxue Qingfeng!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu only thought of leaving first. The Black Fiend wouldn't find Dong Yue Wu so quickly. He still had some time and didn't have to be in such a rush.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Ming Long remarked lazily while he was trying to escape frantically, "Didn't I say before that you would it regret if you miss this opportunity? Why did you forget my words so quickly? Are you not taking the words of your granny seriously?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sudden appearance of the Black Fiend had disrupted her words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What do you have to say?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Be more sincere in your request. Your old mother is trying to give you a mysterious encounter," Ming Long replied unhappily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Great Aunt, if you have any treasures, don't play with me anymore." Wu Yu was at his wit’s end and was hoping Ming Long would bring him a change of luck.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Haha. I'm not sure about it yet. Dive down deeper so I can confirm it when we are closer," said Ming Long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Dive down?" Wu Yu was swimming just above the underwater lava. If he were to dive deeper, it would mean moving through the lava. Although it seemed like a large area, the area he could move around in was limited. The moment he entered, he would definitely cause ripples. As such, if the two pursuers also followed him down, he might very well be trapped.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Are you sure? What's below the sea?" Wu Yu was still hesitant. He still had to consider his chances a little before he could commit himself to pursue a seemingly path to death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm certain that there are two Subterranean Treasured Moon Furnaces. We are at the bottom of the sea, and it's a miracle for them to appear here. However, the Subterranean Treasured Moon Furnaces would barely bring you any benefits. Considering the huge region affected by the lava and the presence of such a huge volcano, there might be a Subterranean Blazing Sun Furnace at the core of all this."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Subterranean Blazing Sun Furnace!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was the crucial prerequisite for Wu Yu to further enhance his Invincible Vajra Body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had looked up information on Subterranean Blazing Sun Furnace in the divine continent, but his search came up empty. In fact, places with a high chance of finding one had long withered. He had truly not expected to find something he had been dreaming about in the world submerged in the seawater.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How sure are you?" He wanted a better assessment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Perhaps... 20... 30... 40... 80% chance!" Ming Long chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"So what's the exact chance?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"10%!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was dumbfounded for a moment. Sometimes, the way this girl spoke was truly infuriating. It was just 10% and she was going on about 20... 30... 40... 80% chance...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he still thought about it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if it was just 10%, he still wanted to take a look, considering how important it was for him! Moreover, there were definitely Subterranean Treasured Moon Furnaces below. Even if there wasn't a Subterranean Blazing Sun Furnace, the environment would still be advantageous for him in battle. At the very least, the Black Fiend wouldn't be able to fight with him under such conditions. As for Cangxue Qingfeng, her demon bloodline likely had affinity with the fire attribute. Nonetheless, it was unlikely for her to have the same resistance against fire as Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's better to lure them down or even hold them up there so they don't go to the blue spirit ore mine."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was only afraid that if he hid himself, they would go for the blue spirit ore mine. No matter what, he wanted to buy some time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, he believed Huangfu Pojun would make the correct decision if he learned about the presence of someone like Cangxue Qingfeng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He retrieved a core-tail talisman and rapidly reported the existence of Cangxue Qingfeng. If the two of them chose to go to the mine now, Huangfu Pojun would still have some time to make his preparations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He felt uneasy and sent another core-tail talisman saying,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Cangxue Qingfeng is really strong. I have found a safe place and will require some time to take control of the situation. You can return to the blue spirit ore mine first and wait for my information. As for whether to leave or to remain, to back off from the mission or hold our ground, I'll leave that to your judgement."</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After doing this, he created a ruckus around him on purpose. After which, he charged towards the lava on the bottom of the sea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lava sputtered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu splashed into the lava and disappeared without a trace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the Black Fiend and Cangxue Qingfeng hovered above the lava. Both of them were shocked. The Black Fiend remarked, "Why did Wu Yu choose to dive in instead of escape? Shouldn't meeting up with the Yan Huang Warship to fight against us together be his best option?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cangxue Qingfeng chuckled. "He probably wants to rely on the landscape to take us out individually. This little guy is really scheming. However, his adaptability and resistance to flames are truly remarkable."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How much so?" asked the Black Fiend.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Let's dive in and finish this brat off. Rumor has it that he inherited some legacy. If he falls into our hands, the resources we could get from him might change our lives forever! I heard that his rise in Shushan was because of the legacy that was left behind by the Transformative Daoist a long time ago. It is also the reason why he can develop 100 doppelgangers!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Fiend was taken aback as he remarked, "I did not expect you to be so well informed. I was cultivating behind closed doors over the last few years and haven't heard about him. We can't let him escape. Let's go!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without further ado, both of them dove into the lava.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, we are here. We are giving you an opportunity to kill us here. Do you dare to show yourself?" The Black Fiend continued his taunts for some time, but he didn't sense or hear Wu Yu at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There are movements below us! He has actually gone even deeper! He's crazy!" Cangxue Qingfeng was astonished, and the two of them continued diving deeper.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Cangxue Qingfeng, this is your territory. Do you know what's below us?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cangxue Qingfeng replied, "The sea region here is also known as the Ravaging Ghost Volcano. It was slowly formed over thousands and thousands of years through the cracking of the surface of the earth. The lava pool here runs deep, and I have been using the flames of the lava for cultivation. There are eight furnaces below us, and I typically gather Violet Kingdom Primordial Energy and forge my physical body. I can move freely within these eight furnaces. If you fight within the eight furnaces, your battle capacity would likely be affected. Considering the toughness of Wu Yu's physical body, he should be similar to me.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"As such, this environment does indeed provide some benefits for him. However, killing him will still be easy. This brat managed to kill the White Fiend through his tricks and must be thinking he could definitely take us down too."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them didn't hesitate to dive in deeper.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We are almost at the eight furnaces!" Cangxue Qingfeng remarked with high spirits.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Fiend asked, "Are these eight furnaces the end of the Ravaging Ghost Volcano?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cangxue Qingfeng nodded her head initially but ended up shaking her head. "There seems to be a void space below one of the furnaces. However, the temperature there is truly too high. Even I can't endure it. Despite checking it out several times, I didn't sense anything."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Is that furnace also the one with the highest temperature?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Indeed!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Fiend nodded his head and said, "This Wu Yu is really confident about himself. If he were to choose one of these eight furnaces as the battleground, he would definitely choose the hottest one. We should just head for that one."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cangxue Qingfeng nodded her head and said, "That's reasonable!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them quickly identified the direction before moving off rapidly. As they knew the direction, they might just be a little faster than Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their conjecture was on point and Wu Yu was indeed heading for that. After all, he was looking for the Subterranean Blazing Sun Furnace!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh, gosh! There are eight Subterranean Treasured Moon Furnaces here! If I had found this place in the past, my Nanwu Treasured Moon Golden Vajra Body would be even stronger!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, he was standing above one of the Subterranean Treasured Moon Furnaces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a huge commotion erupting behind him, it was clear that the two of them had caught up with him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......&nbsp;</span></p>
