 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eighth tier of the Jindan Dao Realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At least on this occasion, Wu Yu was finally faster than Nangong Wei and Beishan Mo as he caught up to them a little.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline"><span class="Apple-tab-span">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wu Yu knew clearly that this was far from enough. He had to become even stronger. Otherwise, how was he going to make those who asked him to scram realize their mistakes?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Or how could he change the Mizar Sword Immortal’s view of him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he had lost his supreme immortal treasures, Wu Yu had still improved in battle strength due to the increase in his Jindan essence. Even so, getting new weapons would be at the top of his to-do list.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he had absolutely no money with him now. He couldn't even afford a spiritual immortal treasure, let alone a supreme immortal treasure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a place like Yan Huang Imperial City, sword cores would be useless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, Wu Yu was still looking forward to Yan Huang Imperial City despite being totally broke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had let go of the incident in Shushan and wasn't thinking much about it. Currently, his attention was solely on Yan Huang Imperial City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Xingyu smiled and asked him, "Do you know how many Golden Essence Pills you have to pay to stay within Yan Huang Imperial City as an eighth tier Jindan Dao cultivator?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu shook his head. At this point, the moment he heard the words "Golden Essence Pills" and "Inner Sea Essence Pills", he was completely helpless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"500 a month."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although it wasn't as exaggerated as Wu Yu had thought, it was still a rather huge sum. After all, that was equivalent to 6,000 in a year. For other eighth tier Jindan Dao cultivators, or around the level of Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain, 6,000 Golden Essence Pills was an exorbitant amount.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To remain in Yan Huang Imperial City, one had to refine their jindan fervously while earning money at a frantic pace!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Do you still have Golden Essence Pills?" Shen Xingyu stared at his Sumeru Pouch.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu smiled bitterly and answered, "Nope...."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Come, this is for you." Shen Xingyu was rather decisive as she took out a Sumeru Pouch. It was as though she had prepared for it as she gave it to Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu immediately rejected and said, "Sister Shen, this won't do. I have to rely on myself in the future. I will think of ways to remain in Yan Huang Imperial City. You definitely shouldn't give this to me...."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After receiving so many things from Nangong Wei previously, Wu Yu finally realized how emotional debt could pile up. When they were separating, he could no longer separate his from hers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, he was afraid of others helping him in this aspect currently. Emotional debt was the hardest debt to repay.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What are you worried about? Are you thinking I'm giving you 10,000 Golden Essence Pills? There are only 500 Golden Essence Pills in it, or a month of capital for you to remain in Yan Huang Imperial City. You still have to rely on yourself in the future. Your Sister Shen is still extremely poor. Don't depend on me to spend my money on you so that you can stay there...."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Xingyu gave him a glare.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had really thought she was giving him lots of Golden Essence Pills. So there were only 500. What a miser! All he could do was smile bitterly and put away the 500 Golden Essence Pills. After all, he wouldn't even be able to get into Yan Huang Imperial City without these 500 Golden Essence Pills, let alone earning money within it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Poor. He was just too damn freaking poor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luckily, he still had some things he could sell with him. Other than these, he had some remaining materials which he could create some Golden Essence Pills with. Based on his estimation, these should last for a few months.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, Wu Yu had a vague feeling that they should be reaching Yan Huang Imperial City soon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Huang Imperial City was the largest city in the entire divine continent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, he was close to the more central region of the divine continent. The landscape here was high and surrounded by jade green mountain ranges. Within these mountain ranges, trees and plants were growing exuberantly, and various precious beasts lived in them. Naturally, there were beasts who had gained sentience and became demons. It was said that even a thousand-year ancient tree could also become a demon after absorbing the essence from the sun and moon over time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking across, the divine continent was vast and limitless. Although the central location of the divine continent wasn't as tall as the Clear Sky of Shushan, the view was still limitless and majestic.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the sun had just risen. The rays illuminated the vast land and dyed the surface of the mountains with a layer of gold paint.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu immersed himself within the scorching sunrays. The vitality of the sun was just like his inner self after feeling reborn.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was beautiful and majestic.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having stayed in Shushan for so long, he had not come out often to witness the wondrous sceneries of the divine continent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, a thought struck him. Cultivation shouldn't be just about staying within the spiritually bountiful lands. Sometimes, coming out to roam around would enlighten oneself too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We are almost there, and I can see Yan Huang Imperial City." Although Shen Xingyu had been here several times before, her eyes were still wide open and brimming with desire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Why can't I see it yet?" Wu Yu looked ahead and only saw plateau ahead of him. Although it was very tall, it was rather flat. Looking from where he was to the end of the land, he didn't spot any city!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Xingyu chuckled upon her response and replied, "How silly! Who told you that Yan Huang Imperial City is built on the land? Look to the skies!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was taken aback and shifted his line of sight. Instead of looking far, he looked up. Above the vast and limitless sky, white clouds were tumbling and the place looked just like an immortal region.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that instant, Wu Yu suddenly noticed an incomparably huge city hidden amidst the clouds. He couldn't see the end of the city that appeared to be levitating above the clouds. Right before him, he could see one corner of the city. When looking afar to the faraway skies, he was still seeing a portion of this city.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yan Huang Imperial City is one-third the size of the Common Sword Domain. However, the density of the buildings within it is over a hundred times that of the Common Sword Domain. Rumor has it that the entire Yan Huang Imperial City is actually an indestructible Dao Treasure. There are even some who claim that an apocalyptic demon is still suppressed within it. However, I've been to Yan Huang Imperial City several times, and these rumors are not true at all. These are just gimmicks to attract foreigners to visit Yan Huang Imperial City," said Shen Xingyao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wu Yu heard that it was one-third the size of the Common Sword Domain, he was already greatly shocked. After all, this was a city, and unlike a place like Shushan. Moreover, this city that was one-third the size of the Common Sword Domain was levitating in the sky!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was as though this city had grown wings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The city was shrouded in clouds. No matter how one saw it, he could just see the tip of the iceberg of this snow white city.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite being just the tip of the iceberg, it still resembled an immortal region more than any part of Shushan. It was just like.... palaces in heaven!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That's right. The levitating city that was shrouded in clouds was just like the sky palaces that were recorded in mythology. There was no difference at all!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those pure and graceful-looking palace pavilions, countless winding corridors, green bricks and tiles - they were just like a huge divine dragon hidden within the clouds....&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the sun rays shone on Yan Huang Imperial City, they dyed the clouds golden, making for an exceptional visual shock. It was as though they had ascended into heaven.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yan Huang Imperial City!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu couldn't understand why it was called that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the Yan Huang Immortal Army, he did not give it deeper thought. All he wanted now was to find a new place to start anew. He had nothing else in mind other than focusing on cultivation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Each city gate of Yan Huang Imperial City is heavily guarded by the Yan Huang Immortal Army. Nonetheless, you can enter by paying a sum, unless you are wanted by various major sects, or a treacherous demon that is recorded by Yan Huang Imperial City, or a cultivator that has been blacklisted. You could choose to cultivate, trade, search for treasures, or do whatever you please after entering."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why people entered it to cultivate was because Yan Huang Imperial City possessed Ancient Spiritual Qi. This was the only place in the entire divine continent that had Ancient Spiritual Qi. It was said that Ancient Spiritual Qi’s effects on cultivation made the exterior city similar to the Xuan Sword Domain and the Earth Sword Domain of Shushan. There were even some locations with effects equivalent to the Heaven Sword Domain. As for the interior city, it would likely have effects similar to the Immortal Domain of Shushan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ordinary sects definitely wouldn't have training grounds with spiritual qi similar to Shushan. Therefore, they would spend to enter Yan Huang Imperial City for cultivation and to seek a breakthrough.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A place like Yan Huang Imperial City had countless ways of earning common currencies, as long as one could endure it. These common currencies weren't limited to just Golden Essence Pills or Inner Sea Essence Pills. Any immortal medicine had a clear price assigned to it, and one could use these immortal medicines or trade them for items.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Xingyao brought Wu Yu towards one of the city gates.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Huang Imperial City had a total of 99 city gates. Even so, there were still many people who entered and left Yan Huang Imperial City each day. When Wu Yu arrived at one of the city gates, they descended on the platform beyond Yan Huang Imperial City. Although the platform wasn't big, there were several hundred people queuing to get in and a few hundred other people registering to get out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang Immortal Army had undergone multiple trials and worked for Yan Huang Imperial City. The core portion of it was comprised largely of people from the interior city of Yan Huang Imperial City. For those responsible for registration at city gates, they were largely fringe members of the Yan Huang Immortal Army.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a cultivator army that had adopted a military structure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu came from the army. Looking at the sharp-looking neat row of troops stationed before the city gate, it was clear that they had undergone training. Subconsciously, he was looking forward to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, he realized this might be a more appropriate place for him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wasn't focused on becoming a sword cultivator in the first place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every soldier of the Yan Huang Immortal Army was wearing Yan Huang Immortal Army armor. Huang Yanwu was wearing it too. Yan Huang Immortal Armor was a type of defensive immortal treasure specially made in Yan Huang Imperial City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Huang Immortal Armor was black and golden. When worn, one would look extremely sharp and mighty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although they were similar in cultivation levels as others, Yan Huang Immortal Army soldiers were more outstanding in the aspects of spirit and disposition. Even Shushan sword cultivators who were known to be sharp didn't possess the powerful battle will embodied by the Yan Huang Immortal Army.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu followed the rules and went to the back of the queue to enter the city.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was that he hadn't seen the full view of Yan Huang Imperial City till now. Perhaps there were spirit designs that were masking his vision and preventing him from seeing the most majestic view of Yan Huang Imperial City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Goodbye, Wu Yu." Shen Xingyao waved his hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, don't forget about your Sister Shen. If you really want a woman, you should give Sister Shen a deep consideration. I wouldn't mind being accused of going for someone younger than me." Shen Xingyu gave Wu Yu a playful wink.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was taken aback and shivered. Luckily, she was just joking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, Shen Xingyu was also extremely charming. Her mature appeal was even more alluring than that of Nangong Wei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was that she was just trying to make Wu Yu feel more at ease before entering Yan Huang Imperial City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Thank you. I will never forget the kindness you two have shown me today. I will definitely return it some day." Wu Yu took a deep bow before them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright, don't be so uptight. You're just like an old man. We are leaving!" Shen Xingyu chuckled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was really about time that they had to leave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu followed the queue and went closer and closer to the city.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was feeling a little unwilling to part with them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Shen Xingyao's voice sounded in his ears.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, strive for vindication! I'll be waiting for your return to Shushan!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wu Yu turned around, both of them had left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Striving for vindication? He’s probably encouraging me to not give up and not forget the shame and humiliation in Shushan.... When I return to Shushan, it won't be for me to become a Shushan disciple again. Instead, I'll be relying on my strength to return with pride...."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Xingyao knew him well.&nbsp;</span></p>
