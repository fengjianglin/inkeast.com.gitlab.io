 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the center of the Dong Sheng Divine Continent, the white clouds filled the sky. Yan Huang Imperial City was shrouded in their midst, almost like a sky palace of legends.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At any time, there were many martial cultivators going to and fro.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And in their midst, there were Yan Huang Immortal soldiers Standing guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the Battle of Ghosts and Gods, life had sprung forth from Yan Huang Imperial City with astonishing pace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The earth beneath Yan Huang Imperial City was in the shadow of Yan Huang Imperial City. The vegetation flourished here, and a forest stood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the forest, birds and beasts roamed contentedly. Thanks to the Ancient Spiritual Qi that circled Yan Huang Imperial City, even the birds and beasts here had been affected by the qi, and gained some humanity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On top of an ancient, gnarled tree, two people stood. The man's immortal presence ran deep within his person, and he was a handsome devil. Beside him was a young woman, nymphlike and sultry. Her every scowl or smile would pluck at one's heartstrings. Such a beauteous creature had no equal in the mortal world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her smile was enchanting. When she was around, the sea of flowers around her lost some of their luster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"So that was how the Ghostly Emperor grew strong. The feeling of devouring is great. If the Evil Lord had not met those mortal gods back then, most likely...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Duomingshan Shengxue gave a cold laugh. "Naturally. The Evil Lord is an ancient thing, and gives birth to the most elite Spirits of the Universe."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Fuyao of the Heavenly Seas laughed. "That's true. No one can stop his rebirth. Not even the immortals."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their gaze fell on Yan Huang Imperial City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We're already here. How can we enter the Yan Huang Ancient Well and get the Evil Lord out?" Yu Fuyao of the Heavenly Seas asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Duomingshan Shengxue said, "No matter how much power the Evil Lord has granted us, we still have to plan carefully. We musn't bungle it up like the Necro Lord did. Right now, these strutting orthodox martial cultivators are all doomed, especially that Taixu Sage Master. His doomsday has already come. In order to better savor their demise, we must execute this without mistakes."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was also the personality of Duomingshan Shengxue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had been guarding Emperor Yan's Hall, but had miraculously survived. He had endured his entire life for the chance to return to the divine continent, and now the chance had finally arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He continued, "Remember 50 years ago, when I took first place in the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial? These days, the divine continent is again buzzing with word of the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial! Do you know why I fell out with the Taixu Sage Master? What right did he have to take away what I obtained in the Taigu Immortal Path? Was it right that he snatched away what was mine with an explanation of ‘ill-boding?’ That old geezer is stubborn and sanctimonious. The day I left the Shangyuan Dao Sect, I made a vow that he would die by my hand. Now I'm prepared to devour him. I wonder how that old man's flesh will taste...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Fuyao of the Heavenly Seas said, "That person made Daddy's life horrible. We must take revenge! But what does this have to do with the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I won the previous competition whilst I was still part of the Shangyuan Dao Sect. That is why this time, the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial will be organized by the Shangyuan Dao Sect. With competitors from Yan Huang Imperial City, either the Imperial General or the Yan Huang City Lord will lead the delegation, and many experts will also go to watch. At that time, Yan Huang Imperial City will be virtually empty. If only the Yan Huang City Lord is there, things will be much easier to deal with. After the Yan Huang City Lord came off worse this time, he will not open the Yan Huang Ancient Well again. With the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord with us, are we still afraid of not being able to deal with one Yan Huang City Lord?" Duomingshan Shengxue's eyes glinted evilly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"So there is such a chance. When everyone's attention is caught up at the Shangyuan Dao Sect, our chances of success will indeed be very high. Then, let's act then. In these days, we can still strengthen ourselves in secret. Daddy, I can't wait to get stronger. I want to be like the Ghostly Emperor as well, crushing entire masses of cultivators!" Yu Fuyao of the Heavenly Seas said impassionately, her eyes swirling with gray vortexes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't worry. To you, it will be easy. If we follow the Evil Lord, our future is not just as simple as aiming for immortalhood. Who knows - the day might even come when we can even fight against immortals! This is our fortune."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Father and daughter were excited and restless. The gray vortexes in their eyes swirled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right. Rumors say that Wu Yu is also going to compete at the Shangyuan Dao Sect. If he wasn’t, we would take the egg at the same time." Thinking of Wu Yu, Yu Fuyao of the Heavenly Seas gritted her teeth. Wu Yu had reduced Emperor Yan's Hall to rubble before her very eyes, and even defeated the Ghostly Emperor with Luo Pin. His close relationship with Luo Pin especially vexed her. Thinking back to the Damask of the Sea's Heart in the underground palace, she was even more infuriated!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We do not need to be concerned with him. Once we release the Evil Lord, with the Evil Lord around, obtaining the egg will be easier than lifting a feather. Besides, according to my experiences, the Yan Huang City Lord will definitely keep the egg safe with him. It might not be with Wu Yu. As long as the Evil Lord is released, he can immediately take away his physical body."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That makes sense!" Yu Fuyao of the Heavenly Seas nodded. Thinking of Wu Yu still made her gnash her teeth. She said, "This Wu Yu has offended me time and again. After we succeed this time, I will personally devour him. Let's see how he dares to strut before me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back when she had been undercover at Yan Huang Imperial City, she had had some good feelings for Wu Yu. Who would have thought that he would stand in her way time and again. He had even grown close to Luo Pin right before her eyes. That was even more unbearable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't worry, it's very simple. After the Evil Lord is restored, we will be able to roam the entire Jambu Realm, let alone a nameless little place like this." Duomingshan Shengxue's gaze burned. Right now, he was afraid of nobody.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Right now, we just have to wait for the day to come...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The divine continent was very peaceful. Nothing of note was happening, besides the occasional news of a mysterious disappearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial was imminent, and Wu Yu had no more time to care about anything else. Under the guidance of the City Lord and the Imperial General, he improved by leaps and bounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It looked like he would master these two Heaven Earth Void techniques with no problems before the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial. After all, every time he had a doubt, he could ask them. This made his improvement rate extraordinarily ferocious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this period of time, the 32 contenders were basically finalized. The Imperial General had given Wu Yu and the others detailed information. After all, these were fairly formidable opponents. In order to take the win, one still had to understand the enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He read them carefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial would be held at the Upper Immortal Battle Ground of the Shangyuan Dao Sect. At that time, many of the powers that be and experts of the divine continent would be present, and basically the main force that fought in the Battle of Ghosts and Gods would all be present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the detailed namelist, Wu Yu did not recognize most of the names. They were mostly above 40.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Shushan Immortal Sect’s names made Wu Yu's heart jump. Besides two sword cultivators over 40, he also saw Nangong Wei's name, and she had become a sixth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator. It seemed like Nangong Wei had not cowed after the last hurdle, and had in fact grown stronger. After Beishan Mo had died in battle, Nangong Wei was now the singular greatest hope of the Shushan Immortal Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over at the Shangyuan Dao Sect’s side, Ji Lingshuang, whom he had met the previous time, was a hot favorite for the championship. She was two or three years older than Nangong Wei, but still considered very young.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For the others, there was a sect called Gusu Fairy Peak, who had sent a young girl roughly of Nangong Wei's age. She was also said to be a superhuman talent, on par with Nangong Wei and Ji Lingshuang. She was called Gusu Yudie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her name was not well known, but being praised so highly, she had to be of a certain standard as well. Gusu Fairy Peak was just beside the Shangyuan Dao Sect and was essentially considered a part of them. But a very long time ago, they had drawn apart from the Shangyuan Dao Sect. It was said that they were all female disciples, and a place that the martial cultivators of the divine continent looked towards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wei, Ji Lingshuang, and Gusu Yudie were now hailed as the three talented beauties of the divine continent….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Amongst them, Ji Lingshuang was considered the most favored, Nangong Wei the second, and Gusu Yudie the third. This was the order of ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Qin Fuyao had not been a ghostly cultivator, she would probably have been amongst their ranks as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wu Yu had seen Ji Lingshuang before. She was indeed an otherworldly beauty. Her fairy-like aura mesmerized the masses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But what caught Wu Yu's attention the most was still the three participants from the Endless Demon Seas! This was the only event where demons would participate!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ultimately, the relationship between humans and demons was not good. They often went for the kill at first sight. But the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial was an ancient tradition that had carried on for many years. The demons had always had the right to participate and contest for the right to enter the Taigu Immortal Path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ancient tradition decreed that for this period, humans and demons could not fight. This was the rule of the ancestors, and in this period, it had to be abided by. The demons too were adamant about their right to fight. If they were excluded, then the Endless Demon Seas would be thrown into uproar, and the humans would face unrest as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the demons' request was reasonable. They were part of the divine continent and therefore entitled to their chance to fight for the chance to walk the Taigu Immortal Path. The demons also wished for a fair battlefield to strive against the humans, and win glory and reputation for the demons!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why the demon participants were always the center of attention!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Generally, when faced with a demon opponent, the humans would do their best to stop them! The humans had their collective understanding. It did not matter who won, as long as it was not a demon. Firstly, it was the collective pride of the humans. Secondly, if the demons took first place, then the next Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial 50 years later would be held in the Endless Demon Seas. For human martial cultivators, entering the Endless Demon Seas in large numbers was a detestable notion. Even in large groups, they did not want to enter a place like the Endless Demon Seas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unless they were going to fight the demons, and use the opportunity of the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial to eradicate the demons. But right now, the martial cultivators and demons were at a balance. The demons' numbers were endless, and now they were at an equilibrium. For now, no one wanted to break this balance and bring about chaos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, the demons were not as crazy as the ghostly cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Historically, no one had used the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial to cause trouble. This was evidently a grave tradition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of the three demons on the name list, two of them were what Wu Yu was expecting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were Jiu Ying and the Blood Dragon of Mount Wu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two were naturally the most outstanding! Jiu Ying was the son of Ying Huang, while the Blood Dragon of Mount Wu was the adopted son of Zhu Huang. Between them, the Blood Dragon of Mount Wu held a slight advantage, because he was a little older, although not yet past 50!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In terms of cultivation level, the Blood Dragon of Mount Wu was reportedly an eighth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evidently, he was a super hot favorite of the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial. Defeating him was a heavy responsibility that lay on every talent of the divine continent.</span></p>
