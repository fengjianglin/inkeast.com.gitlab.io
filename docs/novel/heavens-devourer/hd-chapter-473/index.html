 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among these dozen-odd ghostly cultivators, most of them were at the Qi Condensation Realm. Nonetheless, there were still three to four at the Jindan Dao Realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were much stronger than the Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts that were sent to attack the Heavenly Sword Sect in the past.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, Lan Huayi clearly couldn't hold on. After all, the Million Swords Formation required lots of manpower.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Wu You, who had just dabbled into the path of Immortals, could tell that Lan Huayi was looking horrible and had made preparations to commit suicide.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Once the Million Swords Formation is broken, the ghostly cultivators will swarm in and Capital Wu will turn into a living hell. Dong Yue Wu has been around for 10,000 years, yet it's going to end in my hands...."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu You looked to the sky. After a few days of conversation through message talismans, she knew that Wu Yu should be arriving soon. However, she wasn't certain if he would make it back in time...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Our lives are no longer in our own control."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was waiting for the once famous prince of Dong Yue Wu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wu Yu and his 500 doppelgangers arrived, everyone thought they were hallucinating under extreme despair.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, they were waiting for just a single Wu Yu. Why would there be 500 Wu Yus before their eyes?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result, no one in Capital Wu was cheering when Wu Yu appeared. Most of the people felt even more despair.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, those dozen-odd ghostly cultivators were scared out of their wits. Although they were ghostly cultivators, their expressions at this moment were as though they had seen real ghosts! They wouldn't think that they were seeing illusions!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who are you guys? How dare you interfere in our matters!" one of the ghostly cultivators remarked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu stared at the ghostly cultivators. Perhaps the destroyed cities around Capital Wu were their doing. This feud would never be settled peacefully again. Seeing the huge number of mortals from Dong Yue Wu dead, Wu Yu felt exceptionally guilty. However, he was even more furious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, he wasn't in a hurry to kill. A group of doppelgangers swarmed forward and got control of these dozen-odd ghostly cultivators easily. Each doppelganger held on to the neck of a ghostly cultivator. To the horror of these ghostly cultivators, they realized that although they could easily crush and kill mortals casually in the divine continent, they seemed to have become the mortals when facing Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'll be asking questions. If you don't answer me or try to fool me, I'll send you to the afterlife. Starting from you!" one of Wu Yu's doppelgangers said as he pointed to the ghostly cultivator at the left. "How many ghostly cultivators from the East Sea are coming to the divine continent? Are all the ghostly cultivators from the East Sea heading here?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That ghostly cultivator gritted his teeth and replied, "If you want to know the answer, you better treat us courteously! Argh!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he could finish what he wanted to say, Wu Yu's hand raged in golden flames and shrouded that ghostly cultivator instantly. Before the horrified eyes of the companions of the ghostly cultivator, that ghostly cultivator was torched to death. He cried in pain incessantly, making his companions shiver in fear as their faces turned pale.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This whole process lasted for some time. Clearly, this was painful torture.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they saw the ghostly cultivator burnt to death, the people in Capital Wu finally understood that it wasn't that they were seeing things. They verified what they were seeing with those around them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Lan Huayi turned around in shock and asked Wu You, "You... Are you seeing a few hundred of him...? Is he back?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu You's body shivered. Even she thought that she was seeing things. At this moment, she was exhilarated. She looked at Wu Yu with tears in her eyes and said, "That's right. It's him!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After receiving confirmation from Wu You, the countless officials of Capital Wu were over the moon as they cheered. Such cheers were highly contagious! In the blink of an eye, the cheers had reverberated throughout Capital Wu. Instantly, the entire Capital Wu was in ecstasy. Everyone cried tears of joy while chanting Wu Yu's name. To them, Wu Yu was a legendary savior in the history of Dong Yue Wu. His story was at the same level as myths as they circulated throughout Dong Yue Wu. There were even mortals who claimed that Wu Yu had become an immortal. The hundreds of doppelgangers before their eyes now were no different from an act of god in their eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Capital Wu was cheering, Wu Yu questioned the second ghostly cultivator. "It's the same question as before. Answer honestly. Otherwise, you will suffer a more terrible death than the previous guy."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That ghostly cultivator instantly replied in horror, "I'll answer everything I know honestly. Can you let me off?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu hesitated for a moment before nodding his head and saying, "It depends on your performance. Tell me everything you know."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'll tell you!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For the opportunity to leave, the entire group of ghostly cultivators started to compete against one another.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Tell me one by one. There's no need to be anxious. I'll see who can tell me the most details!" Wu Yu remarked solemnly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoever he pointed to would be the one answering. The ghostly cultivators knew how tough Wu Yu was. Therefore, they had completely given up on resisting.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The second ghostly cultivator said, "That's right. Almost all the ghostly cultivators from the East Sea were called in. Our objective is to occupy the Dong Sheng Divine Continent. We are looking to turn this place to our dwelling. Compared to the islands of the East Sea, the conditions of Dong Sheng Divine Continent are simply superior. Expanding our backyard into the divine continent has always been the dreams of countless ghostly cultivators!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu isolated his voice when he spoke. Subsequently, he asked the same question to the next person. That person was agitated and gave a similar illustration.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"They have promised that whatever we robbed and plundered in the Dong Sheng Divine Continent would belong to us! After attacking and occupying a sect, we can take over the bountiful land and start our own sect. If we attack the capitals of the mortals, we can occupy the kingdoms of the mortals. All the mortals within would become our slaves!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghostly cultivators saw mortals as livestock. They were known to use blood, souls, and even infant mortals for cultivation. They were devoid of all conscience. Once a mortal kingdom was occupied and the humans were enslaved, the entire kingdom would definitely turn into a living hell. Based on Wu Yu's estimation, the neighbouring Nan Shan Zhao Kingdom had likely experienced the same fate. This was also why the ghostly cultivators had chosen to attack the capital cities of the mortals first. Capital Wu was lucky to have lasted till this point.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who's the one who gave the promise? Who?" Wu Yu was raging with fury. The fury wasn't just from him. Instead, it was from the entire divine continent. He had flown past a few cities on his way here, and the situation then was hair-raising! The ghostly dao shouldn't exist in this world. Take Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain as an example. He wanted to slaughter a few sects just to create his Ghost Isolation Array. He was the incarnation of a devil!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was that this matter couldn't be hidden away. After all, all the ghostly cultivators knew about it, so there was no point in hiding it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu questioned the ghostly cultivators separately. Those who weren't honest and answered differently from the rest would be killed on the spot. His method was ruthless, and he had lots of doppelgangers around. He had long scared the wits out of these ghostly cultivators.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of the ghostly cultivators said, "Within the Four Islands of the East Sun, Emperor Yan's Hall is the strongest! The strength of Emperor Yan's Hall isn't any inferior to the Shushan Immortal Sect, the Shangyuan Dao Sect, or Yan Huang Imperial City on the divine continent! There are also various other ghostly cultivator sects. Those stronger sects are not any weaker than the Heavenly Ares Sect and Gusu Fairy Peak. Emperor Yan's Hall has eight Emperors. They are the main leaders. Initially, all of them had absolute authority and speaking rights in the world of ghostly cultivators. We would also follow their orders. However, the one that truly convinced us and made us feel that we could successfully take down the divine continent wasn't them, but another person!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had long heard of the so-called Emperor Yan's Hall and its eight Emperors. Those eight Emperors would likely be at the level of the Seven Immortals of Shushan - Primordial Spirit Transformation Realm experts! Considering their capabilities and influence, it was impossible for them to mobilize such a huge force to attack Dong Sheng Divine Continent. There had to be a new existence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That ghostly cultivator became agitated and answered, "His name is Necro Lord!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who is this Necro Lord?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I don't know! It was as though he appeared out of nowhere. Rumors say that he was once the slave of a ghostly cultivator. He was exceptionally miserable and suffered endless torture while barely staying alive. Initially, he was just a mortal. However, he had a chance encounter out of nowhere less than two years ago! He grew stronger at an astonishing pace. Just a month ago, he reached a terrifying level. No one really knows his cultivation level. At that time, he killed his way into Emperor Yan's Hall. Before countless eyes, he defeated the eight Emperors together with overwhelming strength! The eight Emperors could only lower their heads before him to keep their lives. At this point, all the ghostly cultivators are addressing the Necro Lord as the Ghostly Emperor! He's the supreme ruler of the entire East Sea right now. Even the eight Emperors could only agree to work under him and take his orders!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was astonished upon hearing about the whole event.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could there be anyone who had turned from a mortal that suffered endless miseries to an existence that could defeat the alliance of the eight Emperors? He would be even more terrifying than the Seven Immortals of Shushan fighting together. In the entire divine continent, even the Yan Huang City Lord and the Taixu Sage Master might not have absolute certainty of defeating the Seven Immortals of Shushan if they fought together. From what the ghostly cultivators had illustrated, the Necro Lord had crushed the eight Emperors....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The eight Emperors were utterly defeated! Based on the account of the First Emperor, the Ghostly Emperor is definitely the strongest in this world. Even the Yan Huang City Lord and the Taixu Sage Master on the divine continent would definitely be no match for him! He's a miracle of this world. Only with the presence of the Ghostly Emperor would we, the ghostly cultivators, truly experience a rise. Just as many expected, after the Ghostly Emperor defeated the eight Emperors and united all the ghostly cultivators, he announced the attack on the Dong Sheng Divine Continent. He made a promise that he would definitely help the ghostly cultivators occupy the Dong Sheng Divine Continent, or even the broader world! Ghostly cultivators like us have always been jealous of the bountiful land of the divine continent. Now that we have the Ghostly Emperor on our side, we will be invincible! When he kills the experts on the divine continent, the divine continent will be without a leader. This place will also belong to the ghostly cultivators!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghostly Emperor, Necro Lord.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was he a super genius or a resurrected demon?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing the entire account, Wu Yu felt a little bottled up. If the Necro Lord was indeed as tough as they had claimed, the divine continent was indeed facing a catastrophe. They were really at the juncture of life and death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sometimes, the birth of a terrifying existence would indeed bring catastrophes to the entire world. Take the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord as an example. Just a single creature had even forced the immortals to descend into the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, the Necro Lord was not to be belittled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the greatest question was: how had the Necro Lord become such a terrifying existence from a mortal?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He continued questioning the ghostly cultivator.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ghostly cultivator answered, "Rumors have it that the Necro Lord can devour his enemies' Jindans and Violet Kingdoms to strengthen himself. Other than the eight Emperors, he has consumed the Jindans and Violet Kingdoms of those he has defeated. After consuming them, the Necro Lord can even obtain their mystiques. He experience meteoric increases in strength and reaches a new cultivation level each day!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu felt a chill down his spine upon hearing this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This... Wasn't this the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord as recorded in history....</span></p>
