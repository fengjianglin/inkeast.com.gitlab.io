 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for what would appear within the Taigu Immortal Path, nothing was certain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire place might be filled with rare treasures that one could obtain easily. However, the place might be in the center of destructive catastrophes the moment one entered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">the Taigu Immortal Path had an old and long history. All kinds of things had occurred. In fact, there were rumors that numerous Spirits of the Universe were born in the Taigu Immortal Path before appearing in the Jambu Realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Taigu Immortal Path had opened countless times on the Jambu Realm since ancient times. Numerous heroes were raised and some had even attained immortality. However, numerous talents had also fallen in it. Nonetheless, even after countless years, the Yan Huang City Lord couldn't really tell Wu Yu what he would encounter after entering the Taigu Immortal Path.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"To sum it up, many things you find unbelievable on the divine continent will be ordinary in the Taigu Immortal Path. However, to play it safe, I would still suggest you to not roam around recklessly after entering that place. Focus on snatching Taigu Immortal Talismans that are within your means."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu nodded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He would have to rely on himself to reach that majestic world. The Yan Huang City Lord definitely had no other means of sending him over. After all, the entire trip wasn't easy for him either. Now that the divine continent was still in turmoil, he still couldn't leave the place. As such, if Wu Yu wanted to head over to the Yan Huang Ancient Region earlier, this method was the best.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"When will the door to the Taigu Immortal Path be opened?" asked Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He definitely needed some time to prepare.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It opens once every 50 years. You have roughly half a year more. However, this matter isn't as simple as you might think. As for whether you are able to enter the Taigu Immortal Path, you still have to go through a selection."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Selection?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was taken aback. He had thought that the Yan Huang City Lord would appoint him to enter directly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang City Lord chuckled helplessly before saying, "The main reason is because this opportunity would only comes once in every 50 years. Therefore, I don't have the right to decide on this matter alone. The divine continent has known the location of the entrance to the Taigu Immortal Path for a long time. After years of competition, a rule was made that everyone agreed to. That would be organizing a large-scale, intense battle, and the eventual winner would obtain the opportunity to enter the Taigu Immortal Path. This intense competition is held once every 50 years. Looking at the time, it should be soon. The truth is, if not for the Ghostly Emperor incident, the entire divine continent would have been busily preparing for this battle. The incident this time was rather unique too. Therefore, no one has spoken of the battle up till this moment."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu pondered about it and finally recalled it. The truth was that he had read the records. In half a year, the entire divine continent would come together to host a grand event known as the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial! Once every 50 years. What he didn't know was that the winner of the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial would get the opportunity to enter the Taigu Immortal Path.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang City Lord said, "When the door to the Taigu Immortal Path was first discovered, for a very long time of probably several tens of thousands of years, there would always be a bloody contest. The divine continent would always be thrown into dishevel each time and relationships broke down. Therefore, the sects on the divine continent came up with this grand event, and the eventual champion would obtain the opportunity to enter the Taigu Immortal Path. At the very beginning, it was a contest between the strongest of each sect. This lasted for a very long time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Subsequently, the people found it hard to obtain something substantial in the Taigu Immortal Path. Moreover, the Yan Huang Ancient Region has long changed their rules. Therefore, they demanded us to change our rules too. As such, the rules were amended. Those who participate in the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial must be less than 50 years old. The truth is that since that time, this grand event has been a contest between the most elite geniuses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's common for the younger generation to go against each other, and this doesn't harm the relationships between the sects. As such, the rules have stuck. Up to today, no matter if it is the people from the Yan Huang Ancient Region or the demons from the sea regions, they select their most elite talents within a certain region and allow the winners to have the opportunity to enter the Taigu Immortal Path long before the appearance of the doors. Our divine continent was as such too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Therefore, whenever the doors to the Taigu Immortal Path open, those who enter are basically the most elite geniuses! If you can enter, the hundreds or thousands of people who will be competing with you will definitely be the most elite existences under 50 years of age in the entire Jambu Realm. The cultivation levels of the geniuses from the Yan Huang Ancient Region are way above those of the divine continent. With your current strength, you should be below average. Therefore, the opponents that you will be able to choose won't be plentiful. When the time comes, you will have to rely on your luck and means. Naturally, if you wish to enter through the divine continent, you still have to follow the rules by becoming the strongest genius among those that are below 50 years of age."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This age was a hard-capped rule. Therefore, there would be unlucky people who had waited for a long time and yet were over 50 years old or even 60 years old. However, this was entirely based on luck. Moreover, one might not get anything after entering the Taigu Immortal Path. There would only be additional risk. As such, on the divine continent, the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial had now become a battle of glory for the major sects. As for the opportunity to enter the Taigu Immortal Path, it wasn't the priority of many people. What the people truly wanted was the title of the strongest. At the same time, the event served as an effective means for various major sects to establish their authority. After all, when not facing an external enemy, Yan Huang Imperial City, the Shushan Immortal Sect, and the others would also have clashes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking Shen Xingyao as an example, he had now cultivated for close to 60 years. When the last iteration happened, he was just 10 years old and therefore was not luck enough to participate in a trial like this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The most lucky group would be those in their forties. They had the rights to participate and had 20 more years of cultivation than people like Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was said that the rules were the same at the Yan Huang Ancient Region and that the divine continent had just adopted the rules in full. Although the rules had their issues, they had their purposes too, considering the fact that so many people had not demanded a change.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"For the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial, demons have the right to participate too. After years of conflicts and contests, the Endless Demon Seas, Yan Huang Imperial City, the Shushan Immortal Sect, the Shangyuan Dao Sect, and the Tianyi Race can each nominate three people to participate in the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial. A total of 15 people. As for the Heavenly Ares Sect, the Imperial Thunderbolt Palace, Gusu Fairy Peak, and the other sects, they could each nominate one person. In total, that’s another 15 people. For the last two slots, through our discussions, we award them to the elite geniuses that emerge from ordinary sects, or even those without any sect. Altogether, that makes 32 people. Each battle goes on until the winner emerges. To this day, for the majority of the people in the divine continent, this has been a contest for glory and face. They don't have the same level of desire for the Taigu Immortal Path as you. However, they will still fight to become the winner."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only condition was to be below the age of 50. As such, people like Wu Yu, Murong Xu, and the rest would be disadvantaged. This was because there might be geniuses who weren't as talented as them. However, with a dozen-odd years of additional cultivation, these geniuses would be at higher cultivation levels than them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regardless, the rules were the rules. Therefore, it would be difficult for Wu Yu to emerge victoriously. Moreover, the experts of the demons would also be participating.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A total of 32 people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I have thought about Yan Huang Imperial City. You will get a slot, Murong Xu will get one too, and the final one will be given to the number one chiliarch in the previous iteration of the Trial of Huang. He's extremely lucky and happens to be 49 years old. His cultivation level is also higher than yours - eighth tier of the Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea Realm. He already possesses the cultivation level and strength to become a general in Yan Huang Imperial City. It is just that I have not assigned him a position."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There would likely be several geniuses at levels similar to that of the number one chiliarch in the Trial of Huang who were nominated by other sects. Although they might not be as outstanding as Wu Yu, Murong Xu, and several others, they had cultivated for 20 more years.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Wu Yu had time to reach their age, he might be even stronger than the Yan Huang City Lord. However, the rules were the rules, and they had to be adhered to.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu now realized that it wouldn't be easy for him to enter the Taigu Immortal Path.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Based on my calculations, you have roughly seven months to get ready. After some time passes and the effects of the Battle of Ghosts and Gods has passed, the fervor and excitement of the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial will gradually be stirred. After all, it is only held once every 50 years. For the majority of the people, they might only see it several times in their lifetimes. Moreover, this is the ultimate contest of the younger generation across various sects of the divine continent. Perhaps it will have an additional meaning after the Battle of Ghosts and Gods. Whichever sect's disciple emerges victorious from the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial, the entire sect will likely glow brightly and enjoy the limelight. It has been several iterations since our Yan Huang Imperial City has had someone who won it all. The younger generation is the future strength of the sect. If we don't have anyone stepping up and showing the strength of our Yan Huang Imperial City to the rest, the title of strongest that Yan Huang Imperial City has held for so long will likely be snatched away in the future," the Yan Huang City Lord said jokingly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, their reputation had indeed been tainted after not producing the overall champion for several iterations despite being publicly regarded as the strongest force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who won the champion 50 years ago?" Wu Yu was rather curious about the answer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You would never guess it."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed. Wu Yu pondered about it and estimated that the person would likely have reached the Primordial Spirit Transformation Realm by now. For those that were close to 100 years old, the Mizar Sword Immortal from Shushan was one. As for the others, he didn't know any. After all, he wasn't too familiar with the sect leaders of other sects.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang City Lord said, "At that time, the final was between Nangong Xuan and Qin Shengxue. Qin Shengxue had the edge and eventually entered the Taigu Immortal Path. However, the shame is that he had a conflict with the Taixu Sage Master subsequently and was unsettled and short-tempered. He took the ghostly dao and was almost beaten to death by the Taixu Sage Master before being expelled from the sect. He then changed his name to Duomingshan Shengxue and eventually became the Eighth Hell Emperor, the only threat that still lives."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So it was him!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had really not expected it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one knew where Duomingshan Shengxue had escaped to.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Did he get anything while he was in the Taigu Immortal Path?" asked Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang City Lord chuckled and said, "Most people don't get anything. Although Duomingshan Shengxue was considered a genius on the divine continent, he wasn't anything special once he entered the Taigu Immortal Path. Several days after he entered the place, he encountered danger and left without getting anything by crushing the Taigu Immortal Talisman. The truth is that for the past 1,000 years, most of the people who entered were the same - they didn't get much from it. Therefore, our people no longer hold hopes for the Taigu Immortal Path. What they are more interested in is the title of the strongest."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For Wu Yu, it was still simple. He just wanted to use this as a channel to reach the Yan Huang Ancient Region. As for what he would get out of it, that would depend entirely on his luck.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What are your plans?" the Yan Huang City Lord asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Training behind closed doors! Finding some Heaven Earth Void techniques to practice," replied Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang City Lord chuckled and remarked, "Speaking of which, I should be giving you something. That way, you can truly represent our Yan Huang Imperial City to fight for glory."&nbsp;</span></p>
