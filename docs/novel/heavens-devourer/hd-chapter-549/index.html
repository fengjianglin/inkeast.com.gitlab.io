 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Dong Sheng Divine Continent, although everyone knew that Wu Yu's cultivation level was very low, they would never underestimate him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But now it was different. He was at a place where no one knew him. He would encounter talented people from all over the whole Jambu Realm. Wu Yu basically had to start from scratch here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a good thing. Because he was not as outstanding as before, it was easier for him to do things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this was exactly why this sea region demon wanted to kill him the moment he saw him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On one hand, it might be that there was some hatred between the sea region demons and the human race in the Yan Huang Ancient Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, in this Taigu Immortal Path, everyone was competing with each other. In this no man's land, whether he wanted to kill or drive Wu Yu out of the Taigu Immortal Path, or snatch Wu Yu's treasures, both actions were perfectly justified!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, when he encountered Wu Yu, this sea region demon, rather than trying to overcome the strong gravitational pull of this star, had chosen to walk towards Wu Yu and attack him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't think of escaping from my hands." The sea region demon smiled viciously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he was overthinking. Wu Yu simply stood still and did not run at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This sea region demon must be from the sea region. Firstly, I'm not sure if this region is far from the Yan Huang Ancient Country. Secondly, if I snatch his Taigu Immortal Talisman, will I be a fish jumping into the net and end up at the base camp of the sea region demons? Hence, his Taigu Immortal Talisman is useless to me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under usual circumstances, Wu Yu would be too lazy to battle if he would not gain anything from his opponent after he defeated them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a pity that the sea region demon was underestimating him and did not take him to be a threat at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This sea region demon is at least a Ninth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator! I just don't know what type of demon it is."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu used the Eyes of Fire and Gold. This mystique was most adept at seeing the true form of demons. As expected, in Wu Yu's eyes, this demon's true form was exposed. Wu Yu saw a giant shadow. This demon was actually a pure black lobster. It looked huge and fierce, especially its black, giant, hard steel-like pinchers. There were jagged edges on these pinchers, and they became more terrifying every time they opened and closed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were blood red carvings on that black shell. These blood red carvings were like spirit designs, and a bloody aura leaked from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were no demonic lobsters in the Dong Sheng Divine Continent, and this was obviously no ordinary lobster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long's eyes lit up immediately and she started shouting, "My god, you are so lucky. This is a Sea-Breaking Lobster! One year, I searched the sea region for a few months for this delicious food and failed to find a Sea-Breaking Lobster. Quick, slaughter him. His meat is very fresh. You can steam it, or braise it. My favorite is the braised one. That taste is really…."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In her eyes, such a terrifying sea region demon was only food. It was no wonder she called herself the ultimate devil.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Sea-Breaking Lobster suddenly transformed into his true form as he rushed towards Wu Yu. Perhaps he wanted to scare Wu Yu. It probably was also more convenient to fight in his true form and easier to overcome the gravity. In an instant, a giant, black lobster suddenly appeared before Wu Yu's eyes. It was no boasting that this lobster claimed to have the power to break seas!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was like a tiny ant in front of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A giant lobster pincher slammed towards Wu Yu. It felt like the entire sky was falling on him. He probably thought that Wu Yu had no way of avoiding him. But Wu Yu was much more agile than he had imagined. It was only a blink of an eye and he had dodged far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If I battle, we should have around the same battle power. If I want to defeat him, I must use all my power. If he loses, he'll definitely have to use his Taigu Immortal Talisman and then he will not gain anything."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu dared not belittle his enemy. While he might not have anything to gain, if the other party was going to kill him, then he need not hold back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That Sea-Breaking Lobster's huge and hard pinchers crashed onto the ground. In an instant, the whole planet was shaking. A hole had actually appeared on the metal ground. It proved how great the power of the Sea-Breaking Lobster was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You escape quickly, but there's only so much space that you can run to. Where else can you hide?" The Sea-Breaking Lobster cackled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You have to admit that this demon's excited expression seemed a little idiotic. Wu Yu was born in the East Sea and had eaten many lobsters. It felt weird for him to face this gigantic lobster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was about to take out the Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean to fight this Sea-Breaking Lobster!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was so difficult to find another person on this star, and he had actually found a sea region demon. He could only say that his luck was bad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, someone suddenly screamed, "Creature, die!" Wu Yu instantly realized that there actually was someone else on this star other than him and the Sea-Breaking Lobster!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And it was really a person!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking in the direction of the voice, he saw two people coming from the horizon. One was male and the other female. They were travelling together and looked young. With one look, one could tell that they would be seen as even more talented than Ji Lingshuang if they were at Dong Sheng Divine Continent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man was elegant. He wore a long, white robe. On that robe were embroidered clouds. His long hair flew and his face was handsome. He had a righteous aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman was a great beauty. Her most outstanding feature was her hair, which was white as snow. Her eyes were also ice blue. If she did not look so different from Luo Pin, Wu Yu might’ve thought that he had seen Luo Pin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two had seen the Sea-Breaking Lobster attacking him and immediately rushed up. The man was holding a long spear that looked like a purple crystal. The spear was translucent and glittery like an endless sky of stars. Each star light was a condensed spirit design. Wu Yu's Eyes of Fire and Gold took one look and he could see that there were over 100,000 star lights inside it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This long spear was no doubt a dao treasure!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Looks like at the Yan Huang Ancient Region, it is quite normal for martial cultivators of this age and level to possess dao treasures."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu said that because the woman also held a dao treasure in her hands. But her dao treasure was strange. It was something like a precious stone and was controlled by both hands. There were many spirit designs on it, and while it was a crystal, it was obviously no weaker than the long spear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The couple looked at the Sea-Breaking Lobster but only gave a side glance to Wu Yu. They surrounded the Sea-Breaking Lobster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Creature, how dare you attack humans on the Taigu Immortal Path. You are quite brave. Today, I, Li Changgong, will send you to meet your maker!" the man said authoritatively, looking serious as he did so. After speaking, he attacked immediately, not giving the Sea-Breaking Lobster a chance to retaliate. Dao techniques and Great Dao Mystiques combined with a dao treasure - he was very strong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Taigu Immortal Path will be controlled by us humans. It is good enough that sea region demons can take part in it, and you still dare to mess around before me. You are indeed terrible."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That woman also shouted and prepared to attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Little Sister Bai Xueyuan, this demon may be a ninth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator, but I can take care of it. You just have to watch from the sides," the man, Li Changgong, said easily as he fought the angry Sea-Breaking Lobster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That woman said, "This sea region demon is not weak. We can save some effort if we cooperate. After all, there will be other troubles later, and they will require us to work together. This is what we agreed on."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Changgong laughed silently. At some point, the woman had joined in the battle. Two dao treasures surrounded and attacked the Sea-Breaking Lobster. Wu Yu realized that these two should also be ninth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivators. However, from the attack power that these two exhibited, any one of these two could instantly kill He Taijun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them surrounded and attacked the Sea-Breaking Lobster. They had the upper hand. Wu Yu could see that even just one of them was stronger than the Sea-Breaking Lobster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Senior Brother Li's Chasing Stars above Clouds Spear is so famous. This is the first time I’ve seen it. It is even stronger than the stories tell. I'm impressed," the woman called Bai Xueyuan said effortlessly as she fought and chatted with the man at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"LittleSister's Snow Queen Crystal is also not too bad. It is more flexible than my dao treasure. I'm more impressed."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two were probably not too familiar with each other. If they were, they would not be so polite now. Of course, in their politeness, they did not take the Sea-Breaking Lobster as a threat at all. This angered the Sea-Breaking Lobster even more, and these demons indeed could not control their emotions. The Sea-Breaking Lobster might be strong, but it did not seem very smart. Once it was angered, it lost control and therefore was suppressed by these two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu originally wanted to join in, but he saw that these two could handle it well. They should be here because they wanted to save him. Hence, Wu Yu did not join in and watched their battle from the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Looks like the people from the Yan Huang Ancient Region possess much better resources than those of the Dong Sheng Divine Continent. These two Great Dao Mystiques, dao treasures, and Heaven Earth Void techniques are all excellent and rare in the divine continent. However, in their hands, these seem to be the average and usual. I don't know if the others on the Taigu Immortal Path are the same as them."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's eyes were filled with respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was a little troubled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If there are only four of us on this planet, then the only Taigu Immortal Talisman that I can snatch are those of those two. But now they are saving me, and if I turn around and snatch their Taigu Immortal Talismans, even if I gave them my divine continent Taigu Immortal Talisman, my action would still be a disaster for them."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, he could not decide yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he expected, Li Changgong and Bai Xueyuan did not spend much time dealing with the Sea-Breaking Lobster. The Sea-Breaking Lobster was very tough. He fought in anger, and his Natural Mystique was very powerful. The whole planet was vibrating violently. However, he was still suppressed by the two great dao treasures. Just as he was about to be defeated, the Sea-Breaking Lobster finally admitted defeat. After shouting a few words, he used the Taigu Immortal Talisman and left in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was indeed not as easy to kill someone when they had a Taigu Immortal Talisman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the end of the battle, Li Changgong and Bai Xueyuan smiled at each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Senior Brother Li is as the legends say. Young, brave, and powerful."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Changgong looked at her affectionately and said, "Don't praise me, Little Sister. I was shocked by your attacks just now. I don't know which young man will be lucky to be Little Sister's dao companion in the future. That's the blessing of three lives."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu wanted to talk to them first. But at this time, they ignored him. After all, they were flirting....</span></p>
