 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black warship was ancient yet majestic. In every aspect, it was 10 times better than the Yan Huang Warship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many huge beasts carved on the warship, and they were all extremely savage and intimidating! Even the mast was stained with blood. Evidently, this was a warship, and one that had been through many vicious battles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black warship had a robust aura of battle around it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it was the appearance of the dead-or-gone Wu Yu that stirred the crowd more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was all too familiar with Wu Yu's story, especially his three year appointment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hot-bloodedness of youth, and the sheer stubbornness of his passion - that was compelling. Wu Yu, thrown out of Shushan, now had Yan Huang Imperial City behind his back for his return to Shushan. What would happen? Everyone was eager to find out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Commander!" From the crowd, a group of people were yelling madly at Wu Yu. It was the members of the Heaven's Equal Camp. They were overjoyed to see Wu Yu and fought their way forward. The moment the Imperial General made his announcement, they all raised their hands and even took to the skies, making a beeline straight for the black warship!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black warship could fit 10,000 people with a bit of a squeeze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the Heaven's Equal Camp opening up the table, many Yan Huang Immortal Soldiers began to swarm up even without the Imperial General's consent! They were off to the Shushan Immortal Sect to watch the show! Amongst them, it was the chiliarchs and centurions who were fastest, and many Yan Huang Immortal Soldiers were pushing and shoving to get on board. Before long, the black warship was bursting at the seams.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because the chiliarchs and centurions were fastest, basically all of the centurions and chiliarchs who wanted to go had boarded the black warship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black warship was densely packed with enthusiastic Yan Huang Immortal Soldiers. Although they were there to watch the show, they would appear like Wu Yu's super-solid vanguard to the Shushan Immortal Sect sword cultivators! Signifying that Wu Yu was one of Yan Huang Imperial City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright, no more room." The Imperial General was fond of his black warship, and hurriedly beat back the Yan Huang Immortal Soldiers still trying to squeeze their way on board.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, the Imperial General waved a hand, and a dozen beings of the highest power appeared beside Wu Yu. They were all generals on the level of the Shushan Sword Sages, such as General Gu, General Murong, General Golden Imperial, etc. General Qin was absent. Rumor had it that he had been devastated by the news of the undercover ghostly cultivator. After all, he had been the one who raised Qin Fuyao from young.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were a few other unfamiliar faces, but their formidable presence and heavyweight bearing belied their general status within the Yan Huang Immortal Army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial General introduced them one by one to Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'll get right to it. Gentlemen, we're all along for the ride to boost the headcount. After all, this is Wu Yu's private affair. Of course, since Wu Yu has joined our Yan Huang Immortal Army, he's one of us now. Anyone who bullies him again will have to ask us brothers for permission." The Imperial General's charismatic words flamed their passion. Normally, the Imperial General would virtually never lead a party himself. Everyone was really looking forward to see what would happen at the Shushan Immortal Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, Wu Yu, the Imperial General, and the dozen other generals boarded the black warship. There were still tens of thousands of Yan Huang Immortal Soldiers below who wanted to board, but they could only watch with wide eyes as the black warship took to the air. Amidst ringing battle hymns, it coursed out of Yan Huang Imperial City and breezed through the clouds. Flying swiftly through the misty, white fog, it headed west, breaking through the clouds with frightening speed. It was something that the Yan Huang Warship definitely could not compete with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang, bang, bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black warship bashed its way forward!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ordinary Yan Huang Immortal Soldiers were at the back of the warship, while Wu Yu, the Imperial General, and the others stood at the forefront. At this speed, the black warship would reach the Shushan Immortal Sect in no time! And that would be the most important moment that he had been preparing for three years for!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was standing at the crest and braving the howling wind, with a million sword cultivators ahead of him and the mysterious and solid Yan Huang Imperial City behind him. Not to mention the hot-blooded Yan Huang Immortal Army! Right now, riding the wind, he felt like his will was infinite!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How rare was the chance that one could be watched by the world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial General, clad in black armor, stood at the side. The ferocious wind did not make him flinch an inch. A smile broke out on his coarse, scraggly features. With a raspy voice, he said, "There's always a few times in one's youth when emotions seem to soar with no limit. The Shushan Immortal Sect is as high a wall as can be. How do you feel? Antsy?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"A severing of old ties. Nothing to be anxious about." Wu Yu shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That confidence is good to see. But I have to warn you. It's said that Beishan Mo's improvement has been astronomical. The clearest point is that he is similar to Murong Xu - he is able to wield a dao treasure. But I reckon that although Murong Xu has trained bitterly hard, he lacked an opportunity like the Reincarnation Realm. So, even with a dao treasure, he isn't Beishan Mo's match. Shushan has produced a genius like Beishan Mo with great difficulty. The Seven Immortals of Shushan are guiding him in unison, and the reception will be like never before. You had best be careful...." The Imperial General gave him a mocking smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, this was the pre-fight pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was also to prepare Wu Yu mentally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, you have to prove that Shushan was wrong to turn you out. You have to prove that you're better, even than Beishan Mo and Nangong Wei. At least that's how I see it. The Seven Immortals of Shushan don't have foresight like I do. If they did, you wouldn't have been allowed to come over to our Yan Huang Imperial City so easily." The Imperial General's laughter boomed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He spoke with unusual candor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wu Yu was not one who liked beating around the bush either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He spoke the truth. This time, Wu Yu indeed had to prove all that. Back then, when he had been cast out, did they know how crushing it had been? When they had told him to scram, would he just let it go?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfinished business.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Of all the heroic youths and talents I've seen in my life, till date, I, Di Yi, have respect only for you, Wu Yu." The Imperial General clapped him on the shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such high praise?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These words from the Imperial General gave Wu Yu an unimaginable confidence boost. Now he would face the million sword cultivators with a staunch heart. He would fear nothing. A far cry from how helpless he had been during his exile! Because he had grown stronger now! Because at this time, he had the Imperial General, the Yan Huang City Lord, and the entire Yan Huang Imperial City behind him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, all the Mara in your heart must be banished with utmost effort! All the worries of the world can be beaten with heart!" General Gu had come forth as well, to offer these solemn words of advice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right. The recklessness of youth charges you to pay boon and bane likewise. However many eyes rolled in scorn back then - make them roll in admiration today!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sweep aside the rage in your heart until it is empty. At that time, you will see that the path of dao is a level plain of light. It is said that the immortals of the dao are not necessarily great sages, but they must be equanimous people."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although these words were disparate quotes, they were of great help to Wu Yu. He understood what he had to do in front of everyone when he returned to Shushan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang, bang, bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Amidst the exclamations of the Yan Huang Immortal Army, the black warship cut through the wind to reveal a looming, sword-shaped peak in the midst of the clouds! The Clear Sky of Shushan! The Clear Sky of Shushan, piercing through the cloud layer! Once, it had been the place of Wu Yu's dreams!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Common Sword Domain stretched out endlessly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Clear Sky of Shushan stood pencil-straight, like a pillar of the heavens connected to the immortal palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the Clear Sky of Shushan, it was as though a huge, keen sword was lancing towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's gaze darkened as he challenged the huge, keen sword with an unwavering heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could vaguely make out a million beams of sword qi from the base of the Clear Sky of Shushan. The sword cultivators' keen aura filled the air. They were waiting for Wu Yu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Coming alone and coming with backup were two completely different notions!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Coming alone, he was weak, no matter how strong he was. With a group, he at least stood at the same level as the Shushan Immortal Sect. And not as a traitor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial General laughed out loud, completely ignoring the pressure exerted by the Clear Sky of Shushan. He steered the black warship on a roaring course for the Common Sword Domain. When they sensed the black warship's approach, the Common Sword Domain and the Clear Sky of Shushan synchronously erected a protective spirit design. The airspace above the Common Sword Domain exploded with numerous sword qi bursts that rose to the clouds and formed a sword formation that sealed the Shushan Immortal Sect thoroughly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This scene also shook the Yan Huang Immortal Army. Although this was an automatic response by the Sect-Protecting Spirit Design, this had taken the Yan Huang Immortal Army down by a peg!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, Beishan Mo and the others knew that Wu Yu had arrived! Actually, only two days since the appointment day had passed, and Beishan Mo and the others had settled down to wait.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had thought that Wu Yu would delay the full 10 days!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With this Sect-Protecting Spirit Design, the Imperial General could not go in. If he forced his way in, that would lead to open war, and he was far from that level of bad blood with the Shushan Immortal Sect. Therefore, he stood on the deck of the black warship and let his ringing voice echo forth! He said, "Seven Immortals of Shushan, I, Di Yi, come from afar, escorting Wu Yu, a member of my Yan Huang Imperial City. We are headed for the appointment with Beishan Mo of Shushan. You actually dare to use the Sect Protecting Spirit Design to keep us outside? How discourteous of you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Imperial General!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing this voice, the Shushan sword cultivators were intimidated. They had been extremely afraid that this Imperial General would come. It was said that Yan Huang Imperial City had two experts, and even the Imperial General outclassed the strongest Dubhe Sword Immortal of Shushan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In actual fact, on the Mortal Arena, two Sword Immortals stood ready - the Mizar Sword Immortal and the Ursae Sword Immortal. The Mizar Sword Immortal was uncommonly noble, a young and impressive figure, while the Ursae Sword Immortal stood beaming, an enigmatic presence. When the Imperial General rolled up in the black warship, the Mizar Sword Immortal was extremely angry. He raged, "How bold of him! To directly ride his immortal treasure and want to enter! Does he think our Shushan Immortal Sect is his back garden? No way will we let him get away with it. That brat comes to Shushan Immortal Sect and dares to act all high and mighty."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, he said, "Imperial General, please stow your ship and come in with the others."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing this, the Imperial General gave a cold sneer. "I have long heard that the Mizar Sword Immortal has the courage of a mouse. I see it is true. He is even afraid of me steering a battered ship. I had best carry it on my way in so that the Mizar Sword Immortal does not wet his pants in fright."</span></p>
