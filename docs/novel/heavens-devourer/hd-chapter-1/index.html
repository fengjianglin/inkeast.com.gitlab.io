 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu! You’re the Imperial Crown Prince! How dare you engage in such a disgraceful and harmful deed!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You are the Dong Yue Wu Kingdom's greatest shame in history! Our Dong Yue Wu Kingdom's reputation has been untarnished for over 10,000 years. Yet it has all been brought to ruin in your hands!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If the previous emperor was still alive... if he had known of your beastly conduct... he would definitely have been angered to the point of death!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These sharp and embarrassing words from his surroundings overwhelmed him, threatening to tear his eardrums apart. Wu Yu was experiencing a splitting headache. He tried his very best to open his eyes, yet his eyelids felt like they were glued shut. His head was constantly throbbing. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I must be dreaming. I remember… It’s my coronation ceremony tomorrow. I need to sleep now, only then can I wake up early tomorrow..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his martial cultivation, the only time he was unable to control his body was in his dreams.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu! You are utterly heartless. For how much longer do you plan to continue with this facade?" Yet another sharp voice rang out. It was as though a cold wind had pierced through his ears and bones. It seemed as though someone was shouting right into his ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Uhn..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scene in front of him was a little blurry. It seemed as though he was on a bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It felt as though he was in the midst of winter. Even with his martial cultivation, he still felt the cold seep through his bones.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Uhn..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His head throbbed in pain and his vision was blurry. As he looked towards the side of his bed, on it sat a dishevelled girl. She looked extremely seductive, one who could move crowds with just her beauty. Her ragged clothes barely hid her pristine and tender white flesh. Her head of messy, long hair lay scattered across her chest. The sight was indeed moving.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was a true beauty. What's more, they had just shared the night. Yet she was curled up in a corner, panic evident in her eyes with her delicate and exquisite face ruined by tear streaks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Imperial Concubine Xi!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This situation struck Wu Yu like a bolt from the blue.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Imperial Concubine Xi was the prior Emperor's imperial concubine. In other words, she was his dad's woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu did not like this woman. Why was he even dreaming of her? And what was this scene?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, he felt extremely cold. It was as though he was only wearing a pair of shorts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His splitting headache threatened to crack his head open. Wu Yu fainted once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hua!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A basin of icy water was doused upon him. Wu Yu woke up in shock. He realized that he was lying on the icy ground and he truly had no clothes on! &nbsp;There were numerous people around him, giving him vicious and disappointed stares.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This... is not a dream!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was hit with a sudden bout of clarity. Although he was still feeling weak and relatively disorientated, he was able to discern what was happening. This was definitely not a dream.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Tomorrow was supposed to be the day of my coronation! That bed which I was on was adorned with a colorful phoenix... It was definitely not my bed!"</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;This was Imperial Concubine Xi's palace hall, her imperial residence! &nbsp;Just why was he there?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes glazed across the audience. The beautiful Imperial Concubine Xi was already surrounded by her private guards. A thick, fur coat was draped over her body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the Dong Yue Wu Kingdom's rules, it was forbidden for any official to step into the official harem's chambers. Yet, currently, all the numerous members of royalty and aristocrats were swarming over him! It was truly an impenetrable crowd. Clearly something heaven-shaking had occurred. Thinking back to what had previously happened, Wu Yu knew that immense trouble was coming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Not good!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he tried to sit up, he realised that he was completely unable to. His entire body was devoid of strength, and even remaining down was strenuous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu! You! You! You are a greedy beast! Imperial Concubine Xi is your mother-in-law! You dare to violate even her?! If this was not discovered sooner, you would have completely sullied the Dong Yue Wu Kingdom's reputation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"A scandal! This is truly a scandal! Oh, late Emperor! He is truly the Dong Yue Wu Kingdom's misfortune! It is truly humiliating!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each and every individual there, whether they were an official or a member of royalty, could only feel seething anger at this act.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I have always said that this Wu Yu does not deserve to be the crown prince, much less to ascend the throne as the emperor! He chose to declare wars for his own entertainment, and his personality is unreasonable and ruthless. He does not care for the law and does whatever he wishes! &nbsp;He did not choose to learn how to administrate the country and is only concerned with the martial way! How does he deserve to be an emperor?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The one who spoke was another prince. His position in the kingdom was high and he had never seen eye to eye with Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu couldn’t help but to laugh coldly. To the accusations of those so-called wars, when he was 14, he had brought the armies of the Dong Yue Wu Kingdom to defend against the neighboring country's incursions. In the end. he had managed to repel the enemies and even managed to conquer a quarter of the enemy's territory. As the Crown Prince, he had become revered, shocking the masses. He had even been titled the Young War God!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With regards to not learning about administration but being focused on the martial way, it was Wu Yu's style of running the kingdom. He was determined to use his martial cultivation to assist him in doing so. He was only 15 this year, but he had already reached the fifth tier of the Sky Realm</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the entire kingdom, including the surrounding countries, there was no one who could compare with Wu Yu. Within the Dong Yue Wu Kingdom, Wu Yu was the number one genius, a cultivating demon!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, many had predicted that in his lifetime, he would definitely manage to reach the 10th tier of the Sky Realm, becoming a Supreme Martial Artist!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Dong Yue Wu Kingdom's 10,000 years of history, only the founding Emperor possessed such a level of cultivational talent! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, in the words of this prince, Wu Yu’s achievements had become nothing more than acts of wanton aggression!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hmph! I also refuse to accept this Wu Yu as emperor. He does not possess the demeanor of a crown prince! &nbsp;If it was not for the untimely death of the previous Crown Prince, why would he have managed to obtain such a position? Furthermore, his mother is of lowly birth, born in the wilderness. If not for the late Emperor's doting affection, how would he have managed to snatch the position of crown prince? This Wu Yu has the blood of savages running within him, so it’s natural that he would be crude and unrefined. His behaviour today is even worse than that of a beast!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The one who spoke was a marshal in the army. Regardless of whether it was in terms of influence or cultivation, he was vastly inferior to Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had a wastrel for a son. This son of his would often cause trouble in the Dong Yue Wu Kingdom. Once, he even killed innocents and then was caught by Wu Yu. &nbsp;That wastrel had even wanted to gift the things he had looted from the bodies to Wu Yu. Yet Wu Yu was incensed by this behavior and had hung him on top of the city gates, leaving him under the scorching sun for three days and three nights until he died. This piece of news had terrified everyone in the kingdom. After which, no one dared to commit such actions again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu understood what was going on. He had been framed. Furthermore, he had been caught in the act. Someone was definitely pulling the strings in the background. This person was able to utilize Imperial Concubine Xi to stop him from ascending the throne. Just who could it be? Furthermore, this individual was able to suppress him by a head!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To be frank, when it came to one's methods and one's cultivation, Wu Yu was unparalleled! Ever since the passing of the previous Emperor, no one had dared to slight him. Furthermore, he was known to be virtuous and upright and possessed fame amongst the commoners.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"All hail Hao Tian the Heavenly Immortal!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A piercing sound caused Wu Yu's head to ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian, he..."</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wu Yu was stunned for a moment. He had not heard wrongly. It was the Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian was a true immortal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was the Dong Yue Wu Kingdom's immortal protector. It was said that he was over 100 years old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was a Heavenly Immortal, something completely different from a human. Even if Wu Yu managed to cultivate to the 10th tier and became a Supreme Martial Artist, he was still far removed from a true immortal. An immortal was such. He had been sent here by the heavens to protect the kingdom from disasters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the Immortal Protector, he would almost never involve himself in the affairs of mortals. They were here for just one reason: to protect the people and slay any demons. Only when demons appeared and were harming people would these usually reclusive immortals come out to slay them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the late Emperor was extremely respectful towards this heavenly immortal. He had also heeded the advice of this immortal many a time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unimaginably, he had actually appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone's faces immediately turned pious at the sight of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu raised his head to look. At Imperial Concubine Xi's palace door, there appeared a faint shadow. It was just an instant, but Wu Yu was unable to see the movement of this immortal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a heavenly immortal, the only person Wu Yu was truly respectful of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian was over a 100 years old, but he looked just like a young man. His face was rosy and his body tall and willowy. Although his hair and eyebrows were white, he possessed exuberant vitality. This was the overwhelming vital energy that an immortal possessed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wore a white robe, and on it was engraved numerous Ba Guas while in his hand he held a horsetail whisk. No evil spirit would dare approach him. A pair of bright eyes adorned his face, shining like the stars above. Nothing could evade his starry gaze. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Our respects to Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial Chancellor, Imperial Concubine Xi, and her guards all prostrated themselves against the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I have understood what has happened today."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian's voice was extremely youthful and resonant. It was full of strength, and everyone who heard it felt their spirits surge with energy. &nbsp;This was the voice of an immortal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Please judge the offender, Esteemed Immortal!" Imperial Concubine Xi's face was full of tears, her body trembling. It looked as though she was feeling extremely aggrieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian declared, "It's fine. One cannot rule the kingdom if one is evil." His pair of scorching eyes stared at Wu Yu. This gave Wu Yu the feeling of immense guilt. That very glance had almost coerced him to confess his very actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, you have committed a grave mistake. The Immortal Dao does not agree with your actions. With the mandate of heaven, I hereby relieve you of your position as the Crown Prince and your right to ascend the throne. &nbsp;From today onwards, I will waste your martial cultivation and banish you. You will serve your sentence in exile, allowing you to experience the mortal world and to be reborn anew."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the Mandate of Heaven, he was stripped of his title, his martial cultivation was ruined, and he was banished! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tragic! Tragic! Tragic!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon hearing the judgment, the royalty and officials began to cheer loudly, "The Heavenly Immortal is wise!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was instead extremely calm. He did not cry or make any noise. All of his feelings were suppressed in his heart. Deep within, his heart was like a raging, flaming mountain with lava roiling about. This was a hatred born from the bones!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was fate! It was his fate!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu couldn’t help but to bitterly smile. He finally understood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ever since I reached my current state, no one within this entire kingdom would dare to go against me! Except for him! Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian! It turns out that he was the instigator for today's scene! If Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian wants me to die, then this is fate! I cannot not die!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Today, the gods want to kill me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu couldn’t help but to laugh out loud. Everyone thought that he had gone crazy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How unbridled! To lack in propriety in front of the Heavenly Immortal and laugh out loud!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The officials seemed even more disappointed in Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You are the shame of Dong Yue Wu!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surroundings were filled with comments of a similar nature. Wu Yu did not mind. He felt that his entire world had been crushed. Why would he have to bother with the superfluous words of the people around him?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, I bestow you with the Spirit Severing Powder."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bestow. This word was truly a joke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was bestowed with the loss of 10 years of bitter cultivation and the destruction of his grand dreams. All of it was going to vanish like a puff of smoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From today onwards, he would become a cripple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was supposed to become emperor the next day, yet he had his spirit severed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If one were to look at Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian, it would seem as though he was grand and glorious. Yet in Wu Yu's heart, this immortal had fallen off his lofty pedestal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hao Tian is just the strongest person in this kingdom. It seems that the kingdom has always only belonged to him."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After swallowing the Spirit Severing Powder, his 10 years of hard work, the dreams that he had held, all turned into dust.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Late at night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had been coolly sent away to be banished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was to become a meat shield, mere cannon fodder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his stature, it would be a miracle if he would be able to survive for just 10 days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yu!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of a sudden, a familiar yet warm voice was heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the cold, prisoner carriage, a dying Wu Yu opened his eyes. A girl was shaking the carriage. Her eyes were bloodshot and her face was streaked with tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu You."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This dignified lady was Wu Yu's elder sister. She had been nicknamed the "Carefree Princess." Although they were not of the same mother, Wu Yu had always respected and loved her. She was the one who understood Wu Yu the best in the entire kingdom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's mother had died young, leaving him with only Wu You as his sole relative.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How could this be? How could this be?" Wu You was trembling in the cold powerlessly. She was crying endlessly, her heart extremely pained; it was as though she had been cut with a knife.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sister, today's result was not of my own actions. It is because the heavens wanted to condemn me. Do you understand?" Wu Yu's hand reached out from within the cage, tightly clutching onto Wu You's pale hands. He was not afraid of the winter cold, but being able to feel the warmth coming from Wu You had caused the calm Wu Yu to tear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I don’t understand what happened, but I believe in you." Wu You painfully shook her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then that is enough. I have always had a clear conscience. However, the heavens are unfair. Do not be sad. In my next life, I want to be your younger brother again." Wu Yu suddenly trembled. The Spirit Severing Powder's backlash was extremely strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Next life... Next life..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing those words, Wu You's face turned pale. She stumbled and fell onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, the soldiers in charge of the carriage shouted loudly and the carriage was led away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wooden wheels of the carriage knocked against the stone pavement, making ka ka sounds, much like one's heartbeat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking back, although Wu You attempted to chase after the carriage, she was weak and unable to keep up. Eventually, the carriage left her behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hua la!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of a sudden, a blizzard descended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From above, countless snowflakes were falling onto the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was an incomparably beautiful winter night. There were even a few stars in the sky, as though they were the eyes of the heavens, watching over the populace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's entire body was covered in snow as he gradually left the territory of the Dong Yue Wu Kingdom.</span></p>
