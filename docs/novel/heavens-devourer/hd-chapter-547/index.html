 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After returning to Yan Huang Imperial City, Wu Yu went to the Yan Huang Ancient Well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial General, the Taixu Sage Master, the Dubhe Sword Immortal, Ying Huang, and the others totalled up to over 1,000 people. They were all very busy within the Yan Huang Ancient Well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two months had passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were debating and preparing fatal spirit designs, layer after layer. All these preparations were for Duomingshan Shengxue and Yu Fuyao of the Heavenly Seas when they emerged from the Dual World Seal. These would kill them in the fastest time possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, layer after layer of defensive formations were installed at the entrance and exit of the Heaven Devouring Evil Residence. With a combination of defensive and offensive spirit designs, even if those two could escape death from the fatal spirit designs, they could not enter the Heaven Devouring Evil Residence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In reality, they were the key, and Wu Yu was responsible for bringing a type of hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, everyone was very serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu first stood on that circular platform and kowtowed to the Yan Huang City Lord. Perhaps after a period of time, even these people who set up the spirit designs would not come here. This place would soon be covered by countless complicated spirit designs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Various powers basically took out their precious rare materials and discussed. They used all the spirit designs that they were adept at, and those that could be successfully set up within half a year. They tried to arrange and layer the spirit designs effectively and even grouped them together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial General stood beside Wu Yu and emotionally said, "With such a scale, even if the Ghostly Emperor were to come out, he would be destroyed and turned to dust. After all this time, everyone has given their all. We all took out our trump cards."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both the Taixu Sage Master and the Dubhe Sword Immortal also stood beside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, we have made all the preparations here and have at least 80% confidence. Your mission is only to account for the slight chance of failure, so don't feel too stressed and throw your life away for it, understood?" the Taixu Sage Master said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Today, they were all taking care of Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The divine continent was indeed a heart-warming place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial General stared at the wall that had become the core of the spirit designs and said in a heavy tone, "Don't worry, I will definitely avenge my big brother."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not to mention the divine continent, even Yan Huang Imperial City did not know that the Yan Huang City Lord had passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Okay."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu did not have to say anything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He believed that the Imperial General and the others would definitely make all the arrangements that they could.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter what, if Wu Yu threw the egg away at the Taigu Immortal Path, the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord would have no way of truly being revived. You could say that if the Yan Huang City Lord had not sacrificed himself and used the Dual World Life Sealing Incarcerating Talisman, the divine continent would be practically unimaginable now. After all, at that time, the egg was in the hands of the Yan Huang City Lord.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Taigu Immortal Path will probably open in two or three days. At that moment, there will be mysterious signs. We'll search for the position of it and bring you over." After speaking, the Imperial General and the others continued with their work.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had to make the most out of every minute and second. Perhaps it was only through work that he could forget the pain of losing his brother.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, I know what happened." Ji Lingshuang was here too. She floated to Wu Yu and said with respect, "I hope that you can succeed on the Taigu Immortal Path. Previously, I blamed you wrongly and said something rude. I hope you don't mind."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No problem, those are small things. That day, I was too reckless and lost my cool." Wu Yu nodded and smiled. &nbsp;Actually Ji Lingshuang was not too bad. She was talented and pretty as an angel. However, she did not seem to have much fate with Wu Yu, so it was difficult for any more emotions to arise between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I don't think Nangong Wei came. She's not going to send you off?" Of course, the things women focused on were different….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu took one look. She really was not here. He did not know if he would have the chance to return to the divine continent after this journey. Perhaps it would be goodbye forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He now needed to go to the Yan Huang Ancient Country to inform them of the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord. First, it was still unknown if they would send someone, and second, if they sent someone, would they take Wu Yu along? That was another matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And third, he did not know if he would die on the Taigu Immortal Path. That was not definite either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this was goodbye and he did not bade his farewell, there would some regrets. However, if Nangong Wei was unwilling, then he would not force it on her. Wu Yu felt that it was alright as long as she grew up well….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu." At this moment Jiu Ying came down too. Even Demons could enter the Yan Huang Ancient Well. In the past that would be impossible….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If you go to the Yan Huang Ancient Region, I told my dad that one day I'll go there too and look for you. Leave a Message Talisman behind. Perhaps one day you will receive a message from me," Jiu Ying said directly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang Ancient Region was too far from the Dong Sheng Divine Continent. There was no Message Talisman that could travel so far here. Hence, if one day Jiu Ying used the Message Talisman after arriving at the Yan Huang Ancient Region, he might be able to find Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother!" Wu Yu gave him a wide grin and gave him a hearty hug.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dong Sheng Divine Continent was too small. One day, Jiu Ying would also go out and explore. Perhaps he could broaden his horizons and surpass his father in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't die at the the Taigu Immortal Path or the Yan Huang Ancient Region. My goal is to defeat you." Jiu Ying laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After their adventure at Emperor Yan's Hall in the East Seas, they had affirmed their brotherhood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Defeating you is also my goal. You are now our public enemy," Ji Lingshuang said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, it was Nangong Wei who had set Wu Yu as her goal and would not rest until she defeated Wu Yu and regained her pride….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as they finished speaking, the Imperial General suddenly came up and said, "General Gu is following up on the the Taigu Immortal Path outside. He just sent news that the gateway to the Taigu Immortal Path has appeared. It's appeared somewhere you can never guess."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Where?" Wu Yu asked in surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial General answered, pronouncing each word carefully, "The Bipo Mountain Range."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How can that be!" Wu Yu had just come from there. This gateway to the Taigu Immortal Path had actually appeared there!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no time for hesitation. The gateway would not open for long, and he needed to rush there in the shortest time possible. Hence, only three of them, the Taixu Sage Master, the Imperial General, and the Dubhe Sword Immortal, would send Wu Yu over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Wu Yu needed to bid farewell to everyone else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The opening of the Taigu Immortal Path was earlier than they had expected by one or two days. Hence, at this moment, the farewell was rushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, we will await your good news."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Remember, as long as you don't die, everything is possible. Don't risk your life."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone paused their work to send Wu Yu off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying had just said his piece and did not add in this time. He only said, "Remember, wait for my core-tail talisman."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"OK!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu nodded at last and took one last look at the Yan Huang Ancient Well. He took one last look at the circular platform that was covered in the Yan Huang City Lord's bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial General led the four of them out of Yan Huang Imperial City and rushed towards the Bipo Mountain Range. Wu Yu had long been mentally prepared, but at this moment, he still felt that everything had happened too quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the road in front of him made him very excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only regret was that he did not say goodbye to Nangong Wei. After all, they had split so hurriedly at the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial. If this was goodbye, it would indeed be one of his regrets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wei Er is very hardworking and will not lose her wits, don't worry." The Dubhe Sword Immortal saw him looking at the direction of Shushan and knew what he was thinking of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I hope that the Dubhe Sword Immortal will guide her more. Please don't let her go astray in impatience," Wu Yu said sincerely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people would take the wrong path when they got too anxious. For instance, Duomingshan Shengxue, who strayed to the ghostly dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dubhe Sword Immortal smiled and said, "Wei Er is the hope of Shushan's future. We'll naturally guide her the best we can and not make such a low-grade mistake."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This way, Wu Yu could put down his worries. He had left all the instructions he had. He could explore the Taigu Immortal Path without worries and finish the important mission that the Yan Huang City Lord had assigned to him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"But how can it be so coincidental that the gateway to the Taigu Immortal Path opened at Wu Yu's Bipo Mountain Range? Perhaps the heavens have arranged for everything to let Wu Yu enter the Taigu Immortal Path?" Even the Imperial General believed that this was a fated arrangement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu also had his suspicions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had already sent a Message Talisman to Feng Xueya to let him know that no matter what happened at the Bipo Mountain Range, he should not panic, nor should he come near.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the way, he received Feng Xueya's reply. He told Wu Yu that something did happen, but he had already locked down the scene and would not let anyone come near.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With three strong cultivators leading him, Wu Yu returned to the Bipo Mountain Range much faster. Not long later, they passed by the East Imperial Kingdom, the Sky Region Forest, and reached the Bipo Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Above the Bipo Mountain Range, Wu Yu had already sensed the Gateway to the Taigu Immortal Path. Looking down, he saw a shiny, white, blurry glow among the mountains, at a certain mid mountain position. This was a glow that he had never sensed before, and it was radiating outwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is the place."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Go down."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, everyone arrived. Feng Xueya was here too. Wu Yu had already told him that he was going to another place, so Feng Xueya knew what was going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was very surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The position in front of him was the Spiritual Qi Spring of the Heavenly Sword Sect. He remembered that this Spiritual Qi Spring had suddenly appeared that year and that it had attracted the attention of Ninth Spirit, the Zhongyuan Dao Sect, and the Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And the original position of Spiritual Qi Spring was the position of Sun Wudao's grave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was there some relationship between them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was surprised and quickly asked, "Ming Long?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long rolled her eyes and said, "Don't ask me, I don't know."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, in the position of the deep Spiritual Qi Spring, there was a giant talisman formed by a concentration of light. This talisman was like a door, and the runes on it were probably very ancient. It was changing continuously too. It was as though there were a few big snakes slithering around on this talisman. This giant talisman was even changing in color. At this moment, it changed from white to black and then red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"After it appeared, it kept changing. I don't know what this is, so I kept the disciples away," Feng Xueya said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial General nodded and said, "Wu Yu, this is the gateway to the Taigu Immortal Path. Let's not hesitate, just jump in."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all. they had said whatever needed to be said. The earlier he entered the Taigu Immortal Path, the lesser the risk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"OK."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter what, entering it was the most important thing right now.</span></p>
