 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, Wu Yu didn't want the two ghostly cultivators to discover his true objective.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the very least, he was trying to buy as much time as he could.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As such, while forging his Nanwu Blazing Sun Golden Vajra Body, he kept aside some attention and energy to argue and insult the two ghostly cultivators. One party wanted to lure the two ghostly cultivators in, while the other party wanted to lure Wu Yu out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As no one was making a move, time was being exhausted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This lasted for two full days!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the difficulty and misery he faced at the very beginning, Wu Yu had gradually become numb to the feeling as he acclimatized. Relying on his unmoveable will, he gritted his teeth and persisted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As his physical body improved, it was finally getting a little easier for him. However, he was trying to accelerate the process. After getting acclimated, he accelerated his pace even further.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, the burning and torching sensation didn't stop from the very beginning. Instead, it got worse as time passed. When the two ghostly cultivators heard his screams, they even suspected that Wu Yu was a fool.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, Wu Yu's skin had been dyed into a dull shade of gold. It was as though he was made of gold, and one could clearly see that endless dull golden lava being absorbed into his body through the pores throughout his body. As his body was being torched, his physical body toughened and condensed. Every molecule in him was engulfed by dull golden lava which gradually embedded itself. If any one molecule was released on to land, it would set an entire forest ablaze.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had devoured one-third of the Subterranean Blazing Sun Furnace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wu Yu was still smart in his actions. He wasn't devouring the outermost layer. As such, in the eyes of the two ghostly cultivators, no change had taken place below them. Ghostly cultivators were exceptionally careful, and Wu Yu knew about this. Considering the circumstances, there was no way they would dive in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, don't bother putting up a last ditch struggle. What's the point of it?" Dissatisfaction was starting to build up for the Black Fiend.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Towards the end, Wu Yu was fully concentrated. He felt that he had said all he wanted and would give away himself if he said more. Therefore, he stopped answering the Black Fiend.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter how the two ghostly cultivators insulted or threatened him, he was solely focused on honing his physical body. With the Subterranean Blazing Sun Furnace shrinking in size, the toughness of his body was experiencing astonishing changes, and Wu Yu felt more agitated and excited.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While immersing in incomparable excitement, even the intense pain from the torching didn't seem as unbearable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Invincible Vajra Body! Through the Heavens and Earth, there's nothing you can't do. You will not be killed or vanquished! How far am I from that stage?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Recalling the time when he first encountered the Ruyi Jingu Bang, Wu Yu started having lots of dreams about it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sword Sect, Shushan, the Endless Demon Seas, Yan Huang Imperial City, the East Sea....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those people and those experiences.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were clear in his mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among which, the one that left the strongest impression was naturally the experience on the Mortal Arena in Shushan. On that day, he was condemned by thousands and thousands of people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite that, he was still pursuing his Great Dao!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The path of the Great Dao is limitless and my heart is eternally determined!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the Great Dao in mind, one's resolve strengthened. The pain of the physical body wouldn't be much after Wu Yu became completely desensitized to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu felt as though his soul had left his body and was watching himself devouring the lava. The giant furnace was being devoured like food and completely digested eventually!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another four days passed. As he accelerated his pace, the Blazing Sun Furnace had almost been completely devoured by him. At this point, great mastery was in sight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the Black Fiend and Cangxue Qingfeng had been waiting outside for a few days and had lost their patience, the two ghostly cultivators weren't dumb. Suddenly, the Black Fiend remarked, "Wu Yu, could it be that you are using this furnace to forge your body while holding the two of us here to buy time for Huangfu Pojun?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He got it right.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, not completely.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, Wu Yu wasn't relying on the furnace to forge his body. Instead, he was devouring the furnace. The truth was that the upper layer of the Blazing Sun Furnace had almost dried out. If they were to dive deeper, they would be able to sense it immediately. In that case, Wu Yu's process of forging his body would definitely be disrupted. He wouldn't reach great mastery of the third tier and wouldn't be able to attain his Nanwu Blazing Sun Golden Vajra Body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luckily, the Black Fiend had not expected him to suck the furnace dry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, any typical person wouldn't have such exaggerated thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this juncture, it wasn't appropriate for him to continue speaking. Previously, he was afraid of them leaving. However, Wu Yu was more worried about them suddenly diving down. If that happened, he would have to be engaged in a major life and death battle just before he achieved perfect mastery. For Wu Yu, this wouldn't be the best idea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cangxue Qingfeng was also enlightened suddenly as she snorted, "Alright then. We shall go after the Yan Huang Warship and grab it before returning to finish him off."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Fiend said, "This kid must be waiting for us to leave so he can escape immediately."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We can't possibly guard this spot forever and watch him forge his body! If he refines himself for a few years, are we going to wait a few years for him?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With their experiences, they estimated it would take Wu Yu at least that much time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After discussing between themselves, they came to the conclusion that they couldn't do anything to Wu Yu. After all, they didn't dare to dive into the Blazing Sun Furnace where Wu Yu was. As such, taking down the Yan Huang Warship would be the more appropriate choice. The Yan Huang Warship would be greatly useful to them. After some modifications, they would possess a mobile fortress which would reap them substantial benefits!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they knew the truth that Wu Yu would at most need another day, they would probably be frustrated and overwhelmed with anger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I did not expect this brat to be capable of this. Even if he escapes, he definitely won't be as lucky next time. No matter what, I'll have to make him accountable for White Fiend's death," said the Black Fiend plainly. After exchanging glances with Cangxue Qingfeng, they knew they had to leave after spending four days within the lava.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was that they couldn't last too much longer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, they might not be really leaving. Perhaps they would remain behind to intercept Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, Wu Yu had reached the final juncture and did not have additional attention to care about what they were doing. He was fully focused on devouring the Blazing Sun Furnace. His current body resembled a giant golden vortex which grew larger constantly, letting out a humming sound. After the two ghostly cultivators left, he became even more brazen as he devoured frantically to forge his body. Every single molecule of his body was strengthened to the limit!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu could clearly feel his strength, speed, defense, recovery, and various aspects increasing steadily!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When piling the effects together, it could be said that Wu Yu was undergoing a major metamorphosis! Every advancement in the Invincible Vajra Body was just like a rebirth through the flames!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang, bang, bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hundreds of millions of metal forging sounds reverberated from his body at every instant. They were dull and heavy but also filled with explosiveness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That golden vortex had sucked the Blazing Sun Furnace dry in just half a day with tremendous speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had successfully integrated the entire Blazing Sun Furnace into his body!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it still wasn't enough! That golden vortex started circulating once again. As he moved up, he swept in the eight Treasured Moon Furnaces within an exceptionally short period. In another half a day, not only had he devoured all the Treasured Moon Furnaces, but he had also devoured an entire Ravaging Ghost Volcano completely. This sea region that spanned several thousand miles had enabled Wu Yu's successful advancement!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the raging sea region dimmed, that explosive golden vortex finally stop circulating and devouring. It contracted gradually until the figure of a human finally appeared in the middle. That was none other than Wu Yu!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of a sudden, the vortex contracted fully, leaving Wu Yu standing alone in the vastless sea. However, his body was still burning with golden flames. His body was gold and exceptionally tough and explosive! Within a radius of three miles, not a single drop of seawater could approach. When it did, it was vaporized instantly!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One would expect it, considering that Wu Yu had devoured the entire Ravaging Ghost Volcano!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment he opened his eyes, the sea region several miles before his eyes was instantly vaporized, leaving nothing behind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang Warship was hovering above the blue spirit ore mine.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Huangfu Pojun returned, he spent half a day to take over the blue spirit ore mine once again after chasing out the ghostly cultivators that had barged in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he settled the matter, Huangfu Pojun received a core-tail talisman from Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was dumbfounded when he saw the core-tail talisman, but he had not informed anyone of it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After re-occupying the area, he finally gathered the centurions and Gong Shuming to his side to explain the situation. After which, he said, "I believe that Wu Yu can hold them back temporarily, meaning they won't be here any time soon. Moreover, I believe Wu Yu has the ability to keep himself alive. My view is to remain on the Yan Huang Warship and guard the place. Members of the Inner Sea Dao Sect, please continue your excavation. If we notice the two ghostly cultivators returning, we can put up a resistance and see how the circumstances develop. If we really can't hold on, we will just leave on the Yan Huang Warship and give up on the mission. What do you guys think?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After experiencing the incident of Chen Cangsong, the centurions wouldn't want to give up. As for Gong Shuming, he wouldn't give up easily, as there was still a substantial amount of ore left to be mined.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"In that case, we shall station ourselves here for now. However, it would be better for ordinary Yan Huang Immortal Soldiers to not head out."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As there were fewer stray ghostly cultivators at the moment and the danger level had increased, one could say that the ordinary Yan Huang Immortal Soldiers had already been taken out of the mission.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The few of us shall head out and watch over the vicinity."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They kept their defensive line close as they were mainly guarding against Cangxue Qingfeng and the Black Fiend.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huangfu Pojun and the rest were exceptionally solemn.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were in a constant state of anxiety. After a few days, the Black Fiend and Cangxue Qingfeng appeared before them!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huangfu Pojun immediately ordered the people of Inner Sea Dao Sect to return to the Yan Huang Warship. As for him, he stood before the two ghostly cultivators. Although he was facing two of them, he wasn't afraid. It was just that he was worried after not seeing Wu Yu and not getting a reply from Wu Yu through the core-tail talisman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You must be anxious to learn about where Wu Yu is, right?" After his arrival, the Black Fiend gave a creepy smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huangfu Pojun stared at him coldly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Fiend waved his hand and said, "That young man is indeed incredible. However, he is still lacking in experience. Cangxue Qingfeng and I have decapitated and consumed him. Who would have expected this young man to be in possession of a great amount of treasures!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You are saying he's dead?" Huangfu Pojun could feel his heart skip a beat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Rubbish! If he wasn't dead, why would we be here today? Our objectives are really simple this time. All you have to do is present the Yan Huang Warship to us and we might consider letting all of you off. Remember! What we want is just the Yan Huang Warship."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cangxue Qingfeng remarked plainly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huangfu Pojun knew that his side wouldn't be a match for them even if all the centurions fought with him. If they were to engage in battle, the casualties would be grave. Therefore, he retreated back into the Yan Huang Warship. With this fortress, he felt more confident.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, many Yan Huang Immortal Soldiers were flustered. It was especially so for Heaven's Equal Camp.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They couldn't accept the fact that Wu Yu had died in battle.</span></p>
