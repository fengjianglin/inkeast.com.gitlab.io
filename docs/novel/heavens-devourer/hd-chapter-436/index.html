 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Pin probably felt that instead of wandering around aimlessly, she might be better off taking the risk and trying her luck by returning to the ancient city.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Getting close to the City Lord was the most dangerous thing for her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was just as Wu Yu had conjectured. That place was the most mysterious place of the entire Yan Huang Ancient Well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu didn't know what she was looking for. However, he knew that it would definitely not be something ordinary.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As such, the two of them got up and set a return path.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn't difficult to make their way back. Along the way, they encountered another Yan Huang Ancient Soul. After giving all he had and exhausting all his strength in battle, Wu Yu finally finished his opponent off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rewards he had gotten were huge too.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The frequency of meeting Yan Huang Ancient Souls seems to be dropping too," Wu Yu remarked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yeah! We have been walking for a long time after all. Therefore, the number of Yan Huang Ancient Souls that could be born is also lowering."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Towards the end, it would only get scarcer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon after making their way through the yellow sand, they could see the ancient city right before them. They did not encounter any other Yan Huang Ancient Souls as they made it back easily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After entering the ancient city, Luo Pin kept a lower profile and let Wu Yu lead the way. Both of them went to the center of the ancient city and indeed found the City Lord still sitting at the initial spot. His eyes were shut and he was resting. He was just like an old rock, without any movements or making any sounds.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wu Yu and Luo Pin returned, he did not react.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu greeted him by putting his hands together before moving to the vicinity of the gates of the city with Luo Pin. Along the way, Luo Pin was secretly observing the surroundings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If he remains in the city, it will probably be hard for you to find what you are looking for!" Wu Yu used a secret technique to converse with Luo Pin directly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Pin answered, "The difficulty is substantially higher here, and it wouldn't be convenient to look for it. We can only walk and look around casually."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu said, "It's alright. We still have time. We can do this slowly. At this point, the City Lord doesn't look like he is planning to chase us out."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu knew that he had to leave some Yan Huang Ancient Souls behind. Otherwise, they would be forced to leave when all the Yan Huang Ancient Souls were gone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, you can just look for a place in the ancient city to cultivate and digest what you have gained. I will just look around in the meanwhile," Luo Pin said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, Wu Yu wasn't able to help her at this moment. Over a period of time, he had been going through high-intensity and prolonged battles. There were many experiences that had not been consolidated. During this period, he had also followed Luo Pin around. Therefore, he would be digesting what he had gained and turn these inspirations into battle strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He sat on the roof of a building, while Luo Pin remained unmoved. She cultivated for most of the day while spending a small portion of time walking and searching around. She was very cautious and therefore would likely not reap any results in the short term.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was that Wu Yu was getting anxious after seeing the light in her eyes getting dimmer. At this point, he couldn't help but think about how great it would be if the City Lord of Yan Huang Imperial City could leave this place for some time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another month passed by rapidly. During this period, Wu Yu had gone to the Yan Huang City Lord with sincere questions. The Yan Huang City Lord answered him patiently but did not tell Wu Yu where he should be heading. Just like the Yan Huang Ancient Souls, he would make some demonstrations and allow him to discover for himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu couldn't help but be impressed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was no surprise he was considered the strongest man on the divine continent. In the aspect of guidance, he was even a little clearer than the Yan Huang Ancient Souls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During this period, Qin Fuyao had also returned several times to recuperate in the ancient city.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she was at the other side of the ancient city. Perhaps it was because of the incident with the Damask of the Sea's Heart. Her expression was cold. Although she wasn't looking at Wu Yu with fury, Wu Yu was able to tell that Qin Fuyao probably hated him and Luo Pin to the core from the coldness within her eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, over the month, the three of them had no interactions despite spending most of their time within the ancient city.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Luo Pin sat beside him, Wu Yu asked softly, "Did you find something? We don't have much time left. It's getting harder and harder to find Yan Huang Ancient Souls during my recent outings." &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His battles with Yan Huang Ancient Souls were a little too frequent before. As a result, the exhaustion of Yan Huang Ancient Souls was also a little quick.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that he didn't know how much time she had left, he was getting a little flustered. Whenever he saw Luo Pin struggle between life and death and yet endure it to continue searching alone, he couldn't bear to see her like this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Pin answered, "The truth is that I have searched through most areas in the ancient city. With the exception of a place with the highest chance of finding it."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Where is it?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The circular platform below the City Lord."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu recalled seeing a circular platform in the vast field. It was stacked with tattered rocks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If you are sure, things are going to get harder. Unless the City Lord is willing to help you willingly," Wu Yu commented.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was that Wu Yu had thought about this. If Luo Pin revealed her identity, wouldn't the Yan Huang City Lord, who was also in the same line as her, be willing to help her?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Luo Pin shook her head and answered, "He wouldn't help me."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she said this, it felt a little bleak and chilly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing her lower her head, Wu Yu felt dejected.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she raised her head up, mustered up her courage, and said, "I still shouldn't give up. Just as you have said, I have to insist till I'm reduced to dust and my dao disappears with my death!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Before the very last moment, no one can be sure that there's no hope!" Wu Yu nodded his head and seconded. This was probably the only way he could support her at the moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was that Wu Yu had a huge headache.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was thinking hard of a way to lure the City Lord away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To his astonishment, an accident happened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While he was racking his brain for a solution, the City Lord summoned the three of them. Wu Yu initially thought that the City Lord wanted to send them out. To his pleasant surprise, the City Lord told them, "I have something to attend to and I must leave. I believe your limits haven't been reached. You guys can remain here for a few more months. However, it would be best that you do not stray too far away from the ancient city while I'm not around. Do you guys understand?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For Wu Yu and Luo Pin, this was the greatest news they could ever get!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two exchanged glances and couldn't believe their ears. Happiness had descended too suddenly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, they still had to suppress such ecstasy at this moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu restricted his emotions and asked, "City Lord, how long will you be away?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm not sure. Probably a month or so," Yan Huang City Lord answered casually.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After speaking, he got ready to leave. Before leaving, he left a final reminder, "Throughout history, people have gone missing or died within the Yan Huang Ancient Well. Therefore, be extra careful when I'm not around."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu and the two girls nodded their head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, Qin Fuyao was standing a little further away from the two. Her face was emotionless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, the Yan Huang City Lord disappeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After waiting for some time and verifying that he had left, Wu Yu asked Qin Fuyao, "Are you still unhappy over what happened in the underground palace?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Damask of the Sea's Heart hadn't been found by her in the underground palace, so Wu Yu felt like he had no reason to give it to her. If she chose to behave as such, there was nothing he could do.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, Qin Fuyao glanced at him coldly. She didn't seem to be willing to remain before Wu Yu and Luo Pin. The next moment, she turned around and left. Wu Yu kept an eye on her till she left the ancient city.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright. Now that's she's gone, she will probably be back in one or two days. We are the only two remaining in the ancient city now," Wu Yu remarked joyously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Pin probably couldn't wait any further. She jumped and landed on the circular platform. Wu Yu followed her. At this moment, Luo Pin had lowered her head while searching on the circular platform piled up from rocks. Two rays of bright blue light shot out from her eyes and dyed the circular platform blue.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The critical juncture!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This concerned Luo Pin's life, so Wu Yu was feeling a little anxious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time was passing very slowly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, Luo Pin exclaimed agitatedly, "That's right. The entrance is here. I have verified it. We have finally found it."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing her relieved voice and knowing that she had found her hope, Wu Yu was happy for her. His tensed up emotions finally relaxed a little here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Entrance?" Suddenly, he recalled the word Luo Pin had used. He thought Luo Pin was looking for an item in the Yan Huang Ancient Well and had never expected her to be looking for an entrance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, Wu Yu didn't know what she was looking for.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yeah. This is just the entrance. We have to get down." At this moment, Luo Pin looked into his eyes deeply.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How do we get in?" Wu Yu was a little lost.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite asking, Luo Pin's gaze was still on him. This made Wu Yu a little confused. Why was she looking at him....&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her pupils moved awkwardly before she lowered her head and said, "Wu Yu, the key to the entrance is with you."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing this, Wu Yu was taken aback. He couldn't understand. Why was the thing she had been searching for an entrance, and why would the key be with him?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Wu Yu couldn't understand her, she paused for a moment before continuing, "You remember that person you buried when you first arrived at Heaven's Equal Camp? I was there that time and happened to see something in your hand. If you weren't in the inner city and I was not willing to kill you, I might have snatched it from you. &nbsp;That thing is the key to this place."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing this, Wu Yu's mind went blank. He recalled the day he had buried Huang Yanwu. After which, he picked up the stone Huang Yanwu had given him. At that time, Luo Pin was indeed nearby, but he wasn't aware that she had seen it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why would that stone be the key to this place?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He recalled the story Huang Yanwu had told him. An unbelievable story of an egg. Wu Yu had not paid special attention to this story at all. Now that he had heard it from Luo Pin, he vaguely understood that the story had something to do with the key Luo Pin was mentioning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Luo Pin had said so, it wouldn't be far from what he had in mind. However, a serious question had surfaced in Wu Yu's mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since they entered the Yan Huang Ancient Well, Luo Pin had wanted to look for something gravely important to her. Yet she had chosen to stick with him. At that time, Wu Yu naively believed that she needed someone to take care of her when she became weak. Or perhaps she was seeing Wu Yu as a friend.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And now, Wu Yu finally understood the full picture. With Luo Pin's personality, she wouldn't have gone with him if she simply needed someone to take care of her. After all, Qin Fuyao had chosen not to go with him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only reason would be this stone key.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, she had approached him with ulterior motives all along. It probably began when he arrived beside the Blue Dragon Camp, or perhaps when he accepted the mission at Yunxi City. It was just that Qin Fuyao was around and she didn't have a chance then... This made Wu Yu a little pissed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Were all beautiful girls so scheming?&nbsp;</span></p>
