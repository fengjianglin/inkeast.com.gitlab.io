 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In all his previous battles, Wu Yu had been restraining himself to different extents and had not released the most violent beast in him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, at this very moment, he was facing off against the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey and was completely suppressed by him, who had a far greater amount of Yaodan essence. Together with the deafening Metallic Monkey Roar, even his Nanwu Treasured Moon Golden Vajra Body couldn't make up for the difference. All of a sudden, that Thousand Pound Column smashed down towards his head like the scorching sun setting from the skies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey was truly incredible. From that strike, Wu Yu seemed to experience the pressure he had exerted on his previous opponents himself!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Weng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the heavens and earth seemed to be trembling from the force of that blow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu braced his Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column to face the Thousand Pound Column. The Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column also possessed spirituality. With Wu Yu activating it through his Jindan essence, it was letting out an incessant humming sound.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Violent Art!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a blink of an eye, Wu Yu executed the Transformation Art he had not used for over a year. This transformation art caused changes to Wu Yu's physical body. It was especially so around his arms, which became stronger and thicker. Golden veins could be seen running through his muscles, exhibiting raw and savage strength. It was as though there were countless huge beasts hidden within his muscles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Nine-Directional World Shatterer!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a huge explosion, Wu Yu activated the Nine-Directional World Shatterer Design together with the Violent Art and Immortal Ape Transformation and a destructive will wrapped around the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column. When Wu Yu swung it towards the sky, the power of the Immortal Treasure Spirit Design flooded over! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that instant, the Thousand Pound Column and Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column clashed heavily. The resulting shockwaves shook the entire Sixth Hunting Ground!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bam!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The loud explosion overwhelmed the Metallic Monkey Roar of the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey. That was what deafening really meant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The next moment, no one was able to catch a good glimpse of what was happening. Dazzling golden rays had blinded their vision. Even demons would feel sharp if they were pierced by these golden rays.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pa, pa!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What followed two consecutive sounds were the cries of the Void Bird.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What happened was that two objects had smashed heavily onto the barrier of the Void Lock, causing a huge stress on the Void Lock.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the light dimmed down and the crowd focused on the scene, they saw the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey and Wu Yu smashed to the left and right respectively. Taking a closer look at the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey, he seemed to be in a daze and looking blankly at Wu Yu. Throughout his body, one could vaguely see some cracks. Clearly, he wasn't able to crush and kill Wu Yu in the previous clash and was unable to clinch victory directly. In fact, he seemed to have been injured in the process...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, this was after Wu Yu had gone through six intense battles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, although Wu Yu's condition wasn't much better than the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey and even had deeper cracks on his arm, he wasn't defeated yet. His current performance instantly made the demons understand that he was stronger, more resilient and harder to defeat than they had imagined!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the Void Lock, the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey and Wu Yu in his Immortal Ape form were both panting heavily from the previous clash.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey lowered his head a little, squinted his eyes, and stared at Wu Yu. Violence gleamed in his eyes. He spat some saliva out and said in an eerie tone, "I didn't expect you to have hidden a trump card. Your previous attack is similar to the humans' forbidden dao techniques. Am I right? &nbsp;However, you are likely able to use such a dao technique only once. Wu Yu, you must be at your limits now."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, the surrounding demons finally understood the truth. Previously, they were all shocked and in awe with Wu Yu's performance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"So that is the forbidden dao technique we've heard about!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If that is so, he's going to be wrecked now."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu pulled along the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column and felt that his arms were powerless. The Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey was right. The Violent Art was similar to a forbidden dao technique. It was just that its might was stronger and the side effects were relatively weaker. &nbsp;However, he wasn't able to beat down the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey even with the Violent Art. Wu Yu's predicament was dire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu~</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey tapped lightly on the swamp as he moved rapidly through the space. With each step, a huge dent was formed on the surface of the swamp.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he lifted his head again, he sneered, "Jiu Ying is trash to have a human friend like you. He is the greatest joke in our Gloomy Dreams Seas."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You aren't a match for Jiu Ying. So why did you say that and reveal your jealousy of him?" Wu Yu retorted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm not a match for him? &nbsp;Even if I stand in front of him, how could a coward like him possibly dare to touch me?" The Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey chuckled with disdain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Wu Yu compared him with Jiu Ying, he was clearly displeased. Savageness gleamed stronger in his eyes as he remarked, "I heard Jiu Ying is pretty concerned about you. If I kill you, do you think he will hate me? &nbsp;What a shame though, I'm not afraid of that trash."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey was indeed an extremely savage beast. The moment he completed his sentence, he immediately struck. He had zero patience towards Wu Yu at all. He was preparing a killer move, and this had been noticed by Wu Yu. Most likely, he was going to use his Natural Mystique!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey's entire body turned into metal in the blink of an eye. Even his fur had grown golden, sharp spikes. It was as though his entire body was forged with metal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surrounding demons immediately retreated and looked in awe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He's probably going to execute the Metallic Stone Hell!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If he can fully execute his Natural Mystique, Wu Yu will definitely be killed!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey race is known throughout the world for their Metallic Stone Hell. I didn't expect myself to be able to see it. This is also one of the luckiest thing one could witness in his lifetime!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the conversation between them ended, the Metallic Stone Hell threw the Thousand Pound Column in his hand towards Wu Yu. In that split second, Wu Yu couldn't move away in time and took the brunt of the Natural Mystique directly. The greatest thing about this Natural Mystique lay in the fact that when it was executed, there was no way to dodge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Wu Yu felt a strange sensation on his chest. A stream of formless power was spreading from his chest rapidly. At that instant, Wu Yu looked down. To his astonishment, he noticed that a large area of his chest, including the external skin and internal organs, had been infiltrated by the Natural Mystique of the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey. His flesh was converted into the same type of metal as the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was deeply shocked to learn that there was such a powerful mystique in the world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Demons were indeed the original creators of Natural Mystiques, and they had passed them down through generations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, the speed in which the Metallic Stone Hell spread was extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, just as Wu Yu had been pondering how to break free, his body had turned into metal, and the process couldn't be reversed. In the same time span, his arms and legs had been completely turned into metal. At this moment, Wu Yu felt as though his body was frozen in a large, metal ball, immobilizing him. In fact, all his body's channels, meridians, and even his Jindan had been filled and occupied by metal. It was especially so for his Sea of Breath Meridian. This made it impossible for him to move and prevented him from completing the simplest task of circulating his Jindan essence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And in the next &nbsp;moment, even his head had turned into metal. His entire body was identical to the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey, as though he had been assimilated. The difference was that the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey could move as he wished, while Wu Yu couldn't move at all. Up till this point, other than being able to think, he could no longer perfrom any other actions. Even blinking the eyes was impossible as it felt like hundreds of millions of pounds of force were restricting them from moving.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the Metallic Stone Hell.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What Wu Yu could see was just like what one would see in hell. Other than him, his entire world was surrounded by steel. As for the demons looking from the outside, Wu Yu just seemed to have been turned into metal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It seems I have gotten another piece of art. &nbsp;How vivid!" The laughter of the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey resounded. Wu Yu couldn't see or hear him. The reason why he still knew what the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey was saying was probably because of his mind, or extrasensory senses of the soul. Wu Yu wasn't familiar with the will of his soul. For him to truly notice its existence, he would likely need to reach the legendary Primordial Spirit Realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was in a dark world filled with only metal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pa!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu vaguely felt the huge palm of the Metallic Stone Hell on his head like he was holding on to a small marble. He demonstrated to the surrounding demons and said, "Take a look, everyone. This is the Wu Yu who has been giving you guys a headache. After getting hit by my Metallic Stone Hell, he's no different from a dead man. What's interesting is that within two hours, he will regain his consciousness unless I crush his brains.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Tell me! How flustered would Wu Yu be if he heard what I've just said? &nbsp;Afraid? &nbsp;Fear?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey held Wu Yu in his hands and laughed hysterically.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey, you can't be really thinking of killing him... You should know that he...."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Spare me your nonsense. Who the hell is he? &nbsp;All humans are the enemies of the demon race. Throughout countless generations, how many of our kind did the human race kill? &nbsp;Don't forget that this is the hunting ground of our demon race. No human is allowed to receive differential treatment in our territory. &nbsp;I'm just going to let Wu Yu know that he's just prey. He should be able to hear everything I've just said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he wasn't as flustered or fearful as the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey claimed. Instead, his heart was at ease. The Metallic Stone Hell was a unique state of mind. It was like standing from a free angle and looking at one's own life and death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had once entered into the Core Sword Cell. That was also a quiet world. However, he wasn't as calm as he was now. He felt as though he was out of the world and everything that was happening in this world had nothing to do with him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps he could scrutinize his own existence clearly because he had such an angle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his imagination, he had been completely turned into metal, and the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column was still in his hand. &nbsp;The Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey was holding him in his hand like a toy and even making fun of him without reserve.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the other demons were following and laughing along.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Life and death is not in one's hands. As the saying goes, life and death is predetermined and the heavens will decide if you will lead a bountiful life. Since a long time ago, many people have held such a belief."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Many people in this world are played around like this. In my view, the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey is the embodiment of fate right now."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"However, there are always people who break out from their predetermined lives. Those who break out from the predetermined paths could exceed the entire world and continue to exist in his dao, unable to be killed or vanquished. I, Wu Yu, am willing to be such a person. I'll go against the heavens' will and shall never die for all eternity."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his heart, the words of the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal seemed to be resounding once again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I am the Heavenly Domain's Great Sage, Heavenly Buddha Domain's Victorious Fighting Buddha! You, who has affinity with me, shall inherit my legacy, go against the heavens' will, and destroy the heavens and earth!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Go against the heavens' will and destroy the heavens and earth!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sentence allowed Wu Yu to find himself, and he found what becoming one with the Jindan meant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jindan was the collation of one's dao. Becoming one with the Jindan would be equivalent to becoming one with one's own dao.&nbsp;</span></p>
