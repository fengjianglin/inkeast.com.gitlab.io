 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The 10,000 Swords Formation was riddled through and through now. Through the barrage of swords, a gap appeared, from which a ghostly cultivator emerged. He charged through the gap, entering the Bipo Mountain Range unhindered!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This could be a turning point!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya and the other eight were still holding the 10,000 Swords Formation against the rest, so only the ninth tier Qi Condensation elders remained to deal with this person. Once they could not hold on, then the system within the Bipo Mountain Range would start dysfunctioning. It might even trigger the same situation that Wu Yu had created at the Zhongyuan Dao Sect. That would be problematic. Once Feng Xueya and the others' formation was broken, then the 10,000 Swords Formation would fail!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that very moment, Wu Yu was gritting his teeth. His entire body was covered in golden sigils that shone through his golden skin. He was like a body of gold and iron!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The disciples around him were also deeply immersed in their sword dao training and their condensation of spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the sounds of fighting came from the Stone Gate of a Thousand Swords. A clash and clatter!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's eyes flew open. He had an uneasy feeling. The disciples in the vicinity were looking around as well, some angry, some fearful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You lot stay here. I'll go take a look!" Wu Yu said to Su Yanli, Qing Mang, and the others. He quickly shifted into a golden beam of light and headed over, vanishing in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Everybody, stay calm. Remember your vow to defend to the death!" Su Yanli was the first to be a calming presence. She too had turned towards the Stone Gate of a Thousand Swords, her immortal treasure longsword already in her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was a little worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu flew on his sword above the mountains, passing the Stone Gate of a Thousand Swords. He immediately saw that there were close to 10 people in the skies above the Stone Gate of a Thousand Swords. They were currently surrounding a black-clothed ghostly cultivator. They had shifted into a sword formation to attack him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ghostly cultivator was dementedly charging towards Feng Xueya and the others. He must’ve been attempting to destroy the 10,000 Swords Formation's internal structure. As long as he could attack Feng Xueya, the 10,000 Swords Formation would immediately crumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such a crisis caused Wu Yu's anger to bubble over!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, there was already a corpse on the floor. It belonged to a ninth tier Qi Condensation elder. The ghostly cultivator had already killed one the moment he entered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If there had been more people here, then they might have paid a higher price in death as well!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ghostly cultivator was at least at the ninth tier of the Qi Condensation Realm; otherwise, he would not have been able to resist so strongly against a group of ninth tier Qi Condensation experts, and still charge towards Feng Xueya's side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Along his wake, mountains and rocks were smashed, and trees sheared down. He seeped forward like a black fog. This was the threatening enigma of ghostly cultivator dao techniques, and it made him difficult to pin down. Even nine sword cultivators were hard pressed to keep him down and block his attacks!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Disorienting Mist Formation had been gone for many days, and Wu Yu could roughly guess which ghostly cultivator this was!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ranked sixth in the Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts, Liu Haijun!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was at the ninth tier of the Qi Condensation Realm, and just short of one spiritual orifice. He was about at the same level as Jiang Ji.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Haijun was holding two different types of immortal treasure, and was a fear-inspiring sight. One was a harpoon with a completely black body, but there were three dead fish-eyes at the top, colored a deep blood-red. With each attack, one could smell the fresh blood emanating from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other was a huge net. It was made out of some organism's sinew, and had been adorned with tens of bronze bells. The chiming sounds were like a ghost's eerie wails. The wailing sent a cold chill down people’s scalps!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With these two immortal treasures, the ghostly cultivator was posing an enormous threat even as he faced the Nine Palaces Sword Formation. The entire battlefield was being pressed by Liu Haijun as he continued to shift towards Feng Xueya's position!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Liu Haijun causing trouble in their midst, Jiang Xie and the others outside were frantically pressing their window as well. They bunched together and pushed, forcing Feng Xueya and the others to have to commit their full attention to the 10,000 Swords Formation and be unable to deal with Liu Haijun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the foot of the mountain, Shen Erjun bellowed his laughter. "Old Liu, leave a few girls and kill the rest! The female sword cultivators of the Heavenly Sword Sect are very tasty! I like them!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom, boom, boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was using a huge crucible as his weapon. He heaved it high above his head to stop the swords flying his way!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both sides were locked in head-on combat now. The battle for life and death had begun suddenly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Haijun hooted. "Don't worry, Second Brother. Today, we will enjoy the fresh-faced orthodox disciples of this immortal mountain on Dark Entropic Lord's behalf! I don't want too many. 300 will do."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With such a turn of events, they were already dividing the Heavenly Sword Sect up as if it were a fish on the chopping block.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ghostly cultivators' blasphemous ways were nauseating to witness. Wu Yu had heard that the ghostly cultivators had no conscience, allowing power to rule them. They pursued no code of honor, and the mighty treated others as though they were cattle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu could see that Night Wishes for Snow and Lan Boli were within the Nine Palaces Sword Formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sword formation was said to be devised by Feng Xueya from an ancient design. According to its records, it could be empowered to form Four Elephants, Five Affinities, Six Dao, Seven Stars, Eight Trigrams, Nine Palaces, or Ten Directions Sword Formation. The greatest strength of the Heavenly Sword Sect disciples was that they could form an offensive formation the moment they had four or more disciples. Wu Yu had only been cultivating for a short while, and had yet to enter such cultivation. Otherwise, he could have joined the Nine Palaces Sword Formation to make it a Ten Directions Sword Formation, and amplify the power greatly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nine swords harranged Liu Haijun, and they fought strenuously. The situation was tense. Wu Yu descended from above, blocking Liu Haijun's path towards Feng Xueya.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't let him through at any cost!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Haijun was fighting the Nine Palaces Sword Formation with his ghostly harpoon. He was not actually fighting it head-on, but employing a ghostly cultivator dao technique to constantly change. He called ghosts and used the Net of Spooky Bells to block them. He continued to pull the Nine Palaces Sword Formation closer and closer towards Feng Xueya!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All four factions were gathered here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu?" Seeing Wu Yu, Liu Haijun's smile grew malicious. The Spectral Concubine and the Dark Entropic Lord had both died because of Wu Yu. And right now, Wu Yu was an important target on this battlefield!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was extremely happy to see this. His harpoon danced and weaved, stabbing the ground. Tens of evil ghosts burrowed out from the ground, clogging the air with a putrefying smell. Tens of vengeful spirits also emerged, and they were difficult to dispel with dao techniques. They wreaked havoc within the bodies of the Heavenly Sword Sect elders!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Weng, weng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The evil ghosts were easily dealt with. Rather, it was the vengeful spirits that were difficult to handle. Only killing Liu Haijun would do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu saw that Liu Haijun was about to rush out of the encirclement, but he knew that he could not possibly face him alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a pivotal moment, and everyone's hearts were in their throats.Wu Yu suddenly saw Jiang Ding and Qinghua of the East, who were tied down. Both were watching the show with a sneer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without a word, Wu Yu took to the skies. In a flash, he had Qinghua of the East dangling in the air, then he appeared before Jiang Xie!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Jiang Xie, back down from the 10,000 Swords Formation immediately, or Qinghua of the East dies!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As long as they backed down, Feng Xueya and the others could extricate themselves for a while, and Liu Haijun would be doomed. They could avert this crisis.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Xie raised his head, teeth gritted. He indeed hesitated for a while, but this was their golden opportunity. He continued to lower his head and charge, tearing into the 10,000 Swords Formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed like Qinghua of the East was not worth a lot in Jiang Xie's heart. He was not as valuable as this opportunity. In that case, keeping him around was useless. Wu Yu shifted his finger into a sword blade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, don't! DON'T!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qinghua of the East was ashen, and shaking all over. He was completely trussed up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Master, save me!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was an important disciple of the Zhongyuan Dao Sect, on par with Night Wishes for Snow. His pitiful voice wailed out reedily under Wu Yu's control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Far away, the Zhongyuan Dao Sect disciples exchanged glances. They were very worried. Jiang Xie showed no sign of intending to save his eldest disciple at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"A pity. Not something your master wants."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu knew that if it had been Feng Xueya, he would definitely have saved his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Crack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu killed Qinghua of the East before everyone's eyes, flinging the corpse into the 10,000 Swords Formation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The flung corpse was cut into a shower of blood that pattered down on the heads of Jiang Xie and the others!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Qinghua!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Xie trumpeted, his face purple with rage. His spiritual power roiled, blasting a huge crater around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He and Wu Yu stared at each other. There was nothing but hostility between them. When he lowered his gaze, Liu Haijun was still heading for Feng Xueya and the others. Wu Yu hoisted Jiang Ding up. With his hands and legs removed by Feng Xueya, Jiang Ding naturally offered no resistance to Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Kid, you dare to kill me?" Jiang Ding's gaze was cold. He was like a god of death - an intimidating manner about him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I dare to kill you. What about it?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu rushed into the air with him. He wanted to find out. Qinghua of the East was not enough. Would Jiang Ding have a greater place in Jiang Xie's heart?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If not, then there was no use in keeping him around either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had saved Jiang Ding for this exact moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the sky, Wu Yu charged Jiang Xie to agape mouths all around. "I'll give you till the count of three. Immediately cease your attack, and back out of the 10,000 Swords Formation with the demons and ghostly cultivators! Otherwise, Jiang Ding will be the next Qinghua of the East!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"WU YU!" Jiang Xie screamed. Even the clouds themselves trembled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This had been their golden opportunity, but Wu Yu was forcing their hand with hostages. With Qinghua of the East dead, Jiang Xie had lost another face of respectability. And now his own brother was on the line, and another pillar of strength for the Zhongyuan Dao Sect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"ONE!" Wu Yu was not going to waste time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Xie was fit to burst, and made his decision. He said to the Ninth Spirit and the others, "Come, we will have more chances. Let us back down for now."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tian Yijun cackled. "Sect Leader Jiang, do not lose your wits now. You must know that Jiang Ding was dead the moment he landed in their hands. If you will not see Jiang Ding dead, then no matter how many times we attack, we will be forced to back down!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ninth Spirit said, "Tian Yijun is right. It's a rare opportunity, and I'm not willing to back out either. If we begrudge Jiang Ding's death, then the sword cultivators will just threaten us with Jiang Ding over and over."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had not expected that the demons and ghostly cultivators would not listen to Jiang Xie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most crucially, the look in Jiang Xie's eyes changed upon hearing these words. Finally, he lifted his head with a hard look in his eyes. He spoke to Jiang Ding. "Brothers we will be. In the next life."</span></p>
