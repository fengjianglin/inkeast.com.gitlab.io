 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After completing his sentence, Jiang Zhuyue felt that he had spoken a little too much. However, after giving it more thought, Wu Yu was just a third tier Jindan Dao cultivator. He couldn't even survive within the Supreme Hunting Ground, let alone gathering 50 Demon Injunction Orders.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He supplemented, "You don't have an Enslavement Injunction Order inserted in you. Nonetheless, if your strength reaches the level for the Second Hunting Ground, you will be forcefully shifted to the Second Hunting Ground."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the arrangement for the prey in the Supreme Hunting Ground. Depending on one's strength, he would be sent to the corresponding hunting ground. Once one made an advancement, he would be immediately sent to a higher hunting ground to deal with stronger demons. This was to prevent them from obtaining large numbers of Demon Injunction Orders after achieving a breakthrough in strength level.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After supplementing what he said, he felt more relieved. No matter how he looked at Wu Yu, Wu Yu wasn't someone that looked capable of making it out. The truth was, few people had ever made it out of the Supreme Hunting Ground alive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Jiu Ying, work hard. Whether your friend can make it out alive will depend on whether you are willing to hunt down the prey of the demon race. I hope you will make it to the Second Hunting Ground soon. At that time, your friend can follow you along. With you protecting him personally, I'm sure you will feel more assured." Jiang Zhuyue laughed heartily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an amazing idea. He had intentions to contact the enforcers of other hunting grounds to force Jiu Ying to kill humans together.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Goodbye." Finished speaking, Jiang Zhuyue and the other Moon Chasing Hounds let out a long and loud cry towards the sky, reverted to their black demon forms, and left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a blink of an eye, they disappeared from view, leaving Wu Yu and Jiu Ying looking at each other.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu looked helplessly at him and commented, "They are using me to force you to kill your way out of the Supreme Hunting Ground."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I had not expected them to do so." Jiu Ying was feeling a little regretful. However, considering the situation they were in, he couldn't come out with a better solution.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu said, "I understand. Even if you let me out of the Supreme Hunting Ground now, the chances of me making it out of the Gloomy Dreams Seas will be slim without any protection. Looking at the current circumstances, I feel that I have two options in front of me."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying immediately asked, "What are the two options?" The truth was, he was feeling apologetic. Because of his identity, Wu Yu had been dragged into this place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu answered, "First, it would be to wait for you to complete the trials of the Supreme Hunting Ground and send me away personally. From what I saw, as long as you are willing to complete the trial, there are still many who are willing to obey your orders. At this moment, they probably find it hard to accept the fact that the son of Ying Huang isn't willing to even kill prey. Therefore, they have made things difficult for you on purpose."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying asked bitterly, "Do you think this is what I should do too?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu shook his head and continued, "Not at all. I feel that there's nothing wrong with your thinking. In my opinion, cultivation, for humans or demons, should follow one's nature resolutely. From my perspective, your insistence of not killing innocent people rampantly is the right thing to stick to. Therefore, I'll support your decision to follow your ideals in this matter. Don't get confused about your dao. Naturally, the final decision will still lie in your hands."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying's eyes lit up and looked at Wu Yu gratefully. In this world with millions of people and demons, Wu Yu seemed to be the only person, human or demon, who could really understand him. As for other demons, including his father, they couldn't accept his dao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was especially so for Ying Huang, the savage demon king in the legends.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh, right, what's the second option then?" Jiu Ying asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu answered, "This option mainly relies on myself, and it would be to gather 50 Demon Injunction Orders. After which, I have to see if Jiang Zhuyue will keep to his side of the promise and bring me out of the Gloomy Dreams Seas. The truth is, if I can get 50 Demon Injunction Orders, my strength level might not be any weaker than his. However, within the Gloomy Dreams Seas, I really would need a strong demon to lead the way for me. He's the Enforcer of the Supreme Hunting Ground. His official identity will increase my chances of leaving this place alive."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying could roughly foresee how Wu Yu's second option would turn out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He shook his head and said, "Collecting 50 Demon Injunction Orders is too difficult. This is the Supreme Hunting Ground after all. Demons are the hunters, while martial cultivators are the prey. No one has been able to accomplish that in a long time. Once you exhibit exceptional strength, you will be shifted to a higher level hunting ground. Although I feel that your battling prowess is exceptional, you will still likely need a few years to make it through the Supreme Hunting Ground. This might delay you..."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, the idea of having to stay within the Supreme Hunting Ground was horrifying. However, Wu Yu was helpless in this situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, with Jiu Ying's current cultivation level, he would still need a few years to make it through the Supreme Hunting Ground even if he started to work hard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regarding this, Wu Yu remarked resolutely, "Let's not think too far ahead in this aspect. Since I'm here and I don't have a better solution, that is all I can do at this moment. Along the way, we can explore and see if there's other options. Moreover, I have the desire to battle with the demon geniuses in this Supreme Hunting Ground. I don't have an Enslavement Injunction Order, so at least my life won't be in danger. As for how long I will take, it will have to depend on circumstances. Jiu Ying, I've made preparations to battle through the Supreme Hunting Ground from today onwards."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying was surprised to see Wu Yu getting used to the developments so quickly. Moreover, Wu Yu had even resolved himself and had plans and objectives for himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From Wu Yu's perspective, he had gains and losses in the current development. What he would gain would be the opportunities to fight with other demons within the Supreme Hunting Ground. In fact, these were opportunities that involved killing and being killed. Battles were the best training and trials he could get.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such great opportunities wouldn't exist in Shushan. What he had lost was the resources from Shushan. After all, this was the Supreme Hunting Ground, so he would most likely not be able to earn any more merit points or get new spiritual immortal treasures.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And there was one more important factor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"My senior brothers and sisters in the Shushan Immortal Sect and Sister Shen will probably regard me as missing. The Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain incident will probably be baffling for them. I wonder how they will look at me when I eventually return....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"And there's Wei Er. She will learn that I’m missing when she exits the Shushan Reincarnation Realm. This will likely be a huge blow to her!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had wanted to use Message Talismans to inform Shen Xingyu about what happened here. However, first, the Message Talisman couldn't reach that far. Secondly, the Supreme Hunting Ground had its own restrictions that even prevented him from escaping. Otherwise, Jiu Ying would have looked for help from others.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for how much time he would spend here, Wu Yu couldn't make an estimate. It was just like being imprisoned, but the feeling was more terrifying than being locked up in the Core Sword Tree. This had greatly shaken Wu Yu's resolve.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luckily, he did gain something, and that was Jiu Ying as a friend.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying felt conflicted as he said, "In that case, I shall start practicing diligently. Since I have already killed Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain, I wouldn't mind killing a second person."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu interrupted him. "Don't act like this. Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain deserved to die. However, if you are looking to get through the Supreme Hunting Ground, I will advise you against killing rampantly. Do as your ideals are. You don't have to make an exception for me."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu...."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying looked to him apologetically.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Good things are usually preceded by rough goings. Most of the developments in one's fate can't be changed. However, I'd still like to try to change my own fate by working hard. In my opinion, the Supreme Hunting Ground can turn out to be a treasured land for me. What do you think?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a saying that went: take things as they come.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying was deeply influenced by how calm Wu Yu was. At that moment, his eyes turned reddish. Without hesitation, he nodded his head and said, "I understand what you mean. In that case, let's have a contest to see who can get stronger faster! Obviously, the precedent is that I will only kill those that deserve to be killed."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was relieved that Jiu Ying was able to think like this and make his own decision.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As such, despite not having known each other for long, Wu Yu truly saw this demon as his brother. Although they were of different races, it was hard to find your own confidante. He believed that Jiu Ying would have similar thoughts as him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"For the first step, what are you planning to do?" asked Jiu Ying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The demons in the Supreme Hunting Ground are basically not a match for me. However, I'm not in a rush to gather Demon Injunction Orders. I'm thinking of finding a safe spot to refine my Jindan. At my current cultivation level, I'm rather weak," Wu Yu answered as he pondered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is simple. The demon race relies on the Enslavement Injunction Order to find martial cultivators. Since you do not have one on you, they won't be bothered to fight you, even if they see you. As for me, I will still need to guard against martial cultivators coming for my Demon Injunction Order," Jiu Ying said heartily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed like martial cultivators that were brought here had really gruesome fates. Even if they wished to hide, there was no place for them to.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the same applied to demons in the Demons' Abyss.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had a lot of Golden Essence Pills with him at this moment. Currently, his Jindan was thirsty for them, and now was the time to refine his Jindan through large amount of Golden Essence Pills. Moreover, Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain had left behind many treasures that he still hadn't found the opportunity to look it through.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Together with Jiu Ying, they first walked around the vicinity. Along the way, they met other demons. Seeing Wu Yu with Jiu Ying, they didn't dare to take action.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Strange, why isn't there any Enslavement Injunction Order on that prey?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I don't know. Perhaps Jiu Ying has taken it away. Eh, this isn't right. He has to kill the prey to get the Enslavement Injunction Order, but Jiu Ying doesn't kill humans."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's really strange."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Forget it, let's not trifle with Jiu Ying. Although he has a good temper, he is the son of Ying Huang after all. I believe that although Ying Huang appears to be really disappointed with Jiu Ying, he still really dotes on him. Jiu Ying is his only son after all.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Moreover, Jiu Ying is the first person in our demon race to have that level of strength at his age. It is just that his personality is too different from Ying Huang’s../."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Walking past them, Jiu Ying smiled helplessly and commented, "Ever since I was born, I've been hearing similar remarks. I'm already sick of them."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You must be really stubborn to stay unchanged under such circumstances." Wu Yu started to be a little impressed by him. There were indeed few who could stay true to how they really thought.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I don't know. I was born this way and I can't change it. Everyone says that I don't look like the son of Ying Huang." Jiu Ying waved his hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they were together, demons would not attack them. As for cultivators, whether it was sword cultivators or ghostly cultivators or ordinary cultivators, Wu Yu and Jiu Ying didn't see a single one of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was said that there were too many demons in the Supreme Hunting Ground with too little prey. At this point, they required a huge replenishment of prey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Prey that could survive under such conditions had their own capabilities for survival.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu still felt uncomfortable at the thought of having many of his kind, including seniors of Shushan, being hunted here. However, he was powerless to change this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like the fox demon in the Demons' Abyss said, Wu Yu couldn't possibly save her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, they found a rather deserted place. It was an underground abyss hidden within a dark, stone cave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'll keep a lookout outside, you can just relax." Jiu Ying transformed into his demon form and sat outside the cave. Opening his nine mouths, he started absorbing the spiritual qi from the atmosphere to refine his Yaodan.&nbsp;</span></p>
