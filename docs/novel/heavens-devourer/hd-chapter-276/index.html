 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the bloody clouds, Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain waved a black flag and countless black flames suddenly burst out. The flames turned into hundreds of big serpents. They watched Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the moment where the killing intent of Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain was heaviest. Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain, who could kill He Taozi, was enraged. With the recovery of his injuries, his suppressive aura spread and returned to its terrifying level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was blocked by Jiu Ying’s gigantic demon body. Both of his hands clutched onto the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column and he closed his eyes. When he stood at this position, there was no need for words. Jiu Ying knew how to cooperate with him to finish this battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying waved his huge, muscular wings and flew. In an instant, the earth shook and the mountains trembled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu stepped lightly on his body and followed him into the skies. Jiu Ying was practically facing Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain head-on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Weng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the bloody cloud behind Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain had long been stuffed full with the big serpent flames. Those flames seemed to be the Soul Capturing Flames of the Ghost Mountain, Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain's dao technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two parties were about to meet in the skies for a showdown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They could see Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain looking down on them. Sarcastic laughter hid in his eyes. Previously, he was wounded by their joint-attack in the miniature version of the Ghost Isolation Array. It turned out that way because he was careless and had underestimated Wu Yu. Today, the two of them wanted to repeat their attack. How could he, Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain, such a smart being, fall prey to their tricks again?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh well, this little guy hiding in the back still wants to launch sneak attacks. Then I shall send you to the heavens first.”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain laughed coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not know how much disgust and how much hatred these two youngsters had for him, especially Jiu Ying. He felt that if he had to kill in his lifetime, then he would have long chosen this Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain to be his first kill!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghostly cultivators should die!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A fierce clash erupted in an instant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What Jiu Ying wanted to accomplish was very simple, and that was his Natural Mystique. In the process of approaching Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain, his nine heads transformed and tangled. 18 eyes, 18 ancient symbols from his bloodline gradually took shape. In an instant, all the disastrous power spiralled crazily and converged in one point. That was the Spiral of Disaster!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Spiral of Disaster this time was well-prepared. Hence, it was even bigger than previously; it was about thrice the previous size! From the ground, a gigantic, greyish-black swirl appeared in the sky. It was rolling vigorously. Within the spiral were flames burning, flashes of dark purple lightning, murky dark green fog spreading, and black wind storms howling and rolling…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying’s Natural Mystique was indeed terrifying!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was actually what Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain was cautious of. He was injured by this Spiral of Disaster previously. As for Wu Yu’s one hit, that was a distraction at most. The result was just that he was swallowed by that Spiral of Disaster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain did not avoid the Spiral of Disaster. Instead, he was facing it head-on! Actually, his thoughts were very transparent. He knew that Wu Yu would still make that sneak attack. Hence, he made all the preparations to get rid of that smart aleck Wu Yu first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These youngsters are dumb. Do they really think that the same trick can be used twice?”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain giggled in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In an instant, that Spiral of Disaster was once again set onto him. It tore apart that bloody cloud and turned most of the black serpent flames into smithereens. Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain’s pair of legs was already swallowed by that Spiral of Disaster. At the moment, the situation seemed to be totally different from previously. And Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain still had the same mildly shocked look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wu Yu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying reminded him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, Wu Yu had already prepared well. Behind Jiu Ying, he had already used the Immortal Ape Transformation and turned into a golden Immortal Ape, except there were some minor changes compared to the previous transformation. This time, his fur was shinier. If not for his deliberate hiding, his aura would be even more frightening. There was no need to mention that under the support of the Violent Art, his blood and muscle strength had increased to an unprecedented, terrifying level. The Violent Art increased his muscular strength by twice its level, so it was as though Wu Yu now had two Nanwu Treasured Moon Golden Vajra Bodies now. This terrifying strength caused even him to suffocate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a feeling of extreme terror. Wu Yu had the confidence that he could even drag the sun down from the sky!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment Jiu Ying reminded him, Wu Yu controlled the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column and rushed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, it was still the Nine-Directional World Shatterer, but in reality, this was also Wu Yu’s current strongest offensive move. Its power surpassed that of his sword dao by a lot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Weng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu rushed out and landed on top of the Spiral of Disaster. He was facing the giant with six gigantic arms directly. Comparatively, Wu Yu was too small.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He raised the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column high in his hands. Instantly, it grew more than two zhang long. On it, the Nine Palace Dragon Design and Nine-Directional Breaking Army Design, under the supplement of the Jindan essence, rotated furiously. The whole Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column was as bright as the sun, shining on heaven and earth. Its brightness was blinding. At this moment, Wu Yu was still trying his best to suppress his power, to make himself seem like before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain grinned to himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This kid actually improved a bit over these few days!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was about to launch his last attack in this instant. Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain had waited for this moment long enough. He was within the Spiral of Disaster. He let out a laugh, and when he waved his flag, the few hundred black flame serpents that had been torn apart by the Spiral of Disaster actually formed again in an instant. In this instant, the Soul Capturing Flames of the Ghost Mountain forcefully left the binds of the Spiral of Disaster and rushed towards Wu Yu at lightning speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were hundreds of big flame serpents in the skies. No matter how you looked at them, they could terrify you.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the method Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain was going to use to kill Wu Yu first. He felt that Wu Yu was ridiculous. He did not know how to be flexible and actually wanted to use the same method twice. Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain started laughing heartily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At one moment, his eyes met with Wu Yu’s gaze as Wu Yu waved that Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column and smashed towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was momentarily shocked because what he saw was a pair of calm and even cold eyes. In normal circumstances, Wu Yu, upon seeing his attack, should have been terrified…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah, my eyes!” Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain did not expect that his eyes would be burned by golden flames the moment he looked into Wu Yu’s eyes. Within a short time, the four eyes on his two heads burned into dust. Within the four eye sockets, there was not even one eyeball left. They were just empty holes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain felt terror and extreme pain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What he could not see was Wu Yu’s heaven-defying blow. All his strength exploded and he smashed down from the sky. All the big serpent flames instantly turned into dust. Wu Yu’s terrifying strength and speed were simply a flash, but they cut through everything and &nbsp;hit Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain’s head directly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain could only feel a despairing, huge pain, but he did not know that two of his heads were already smashed into dust. Even the Spiritual Frame of the Black Mountain was crushed into pieces!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that last moment, he did not even know what had happened. He also did not know where Wu Yu’s transformation came from, and how he could make such a terrifying attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One move, an instant kill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No!” His consciousness was fading. This made Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain realize that death was upon him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He kept recalling, recalling where he had made a mistake. There was not enough time. He simply could not understand. He could only remember that Wu Yu had used his gaze to burn his eyes and then the only impression he had was that cold gaze. After that, he did not know anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m dead.”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;That was the last of his consciousness. He could feel himself being drowned in the Spiral of Disaster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu heaved a sigh of relief. He shrugged his sore arms and returned to his human form. He also kept the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column out. He was only wearing a pair of long pants when he landed. The instant he stepped onto the ground, the ground shook again. You could imagine that while he was in human form, his weight was probably equivalent to that of a 100-zhang-tall gigantic beast, or even heavier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he raised his head, there was a big, grey, spiraling ball in the sky. That was the second form of the Spiral of Disaster. Now that big, grey ball was rotating peacefully. Jiu Ying had already changed into human form and was standing beside him. As that big ball rotated, it soon shrunk into a palm-sized ball. This meant that not even Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain’s body was left. He was disintegrated into dust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain was dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu heaved a sigh of relief with this conclusion. It was finally over. He did not expect that their cooperation could really kill this inhumane, crazy devil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now he was feeling empty. With so many dead, it was difficult to feel cheery. Even though he had gained some merits, it did not seem worthy of joy. After all, He Taozi and the others who came with him were all dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Five Huang sword rank disciples, this was already a big thing for Shushan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he thought of He Taozi, Wu Yu remembered that he was no longer within the miniature version of the Ghost Isolation Array and could use the Message Talisman. Previously, when he escaped from the miniature version of the Ghost Isolation Array, he and Jiu Ying were both in a hurry to rush to the Wind and Thunder Dao Sect. Hence, Wu Yu did not notify Shen Xingyu. Now that they had resolved the matter, and the truth was that it was not caused by demons, Wu Yu felt that there was a need to immediately relay the truth to Shen Xingyu and explain the train of events.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was to prevent Shushan from becoming a mess without knowing what happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He took out the Message Talisman and stated simply the goal and acts of Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain. As for the events relating to Jiu Ying, he hesitated. The truth was that he had defeated Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain with Jiu Ying’s help. It was impossible for others to believe that he had done it alone. But Jiu Ying was, after all, a demon. Was it appropriate for him to state the truth? Would he be punished by Shushan?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it was not right to hide it. After all, the truth could be uncovered. Hence, Wu Yu told the truth. Though when describing, he only said that his cooperation with Jiu Ying was simply for the sake of his life. This way, they probably could not say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After explaining the situation, there were more than a hundred words on the talisman. It was already reaching the limits of the Message Talisman. It was only then that Wu Yu activated the talisman and let it fly back to Shushan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Jiu Ying landed and said, “Actually, Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain was killed by you. When he fell into the Spiral of Disaster, he was already dead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu replied, “Who killed him is not important. The important part is that he is finally dead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The important thing is that since you killed him, these things belong to you.” A few Sumeru Pouches appeared in Jiu Ying’s hands. Those were the things that Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain had left behind.</span></p>
