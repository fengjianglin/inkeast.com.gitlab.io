 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the person who strode into the Time Control Pagoda appeared, Wu Yu's two eyes had gathered the sun's truefire to a peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This mystique could fully harness the power of the sun! Who knew just how much fiery destruction was compressed into Wu Yu’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long had chided him to stop, but he continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, the terrifying explosive strength also carried the potential to inflict grievous self-harm. The Eyes of Fire and Gold were built upon a pair of eyes. If its limits were exceeded, it could very well waste his set of ocular glands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thankfully, someone had popped up to bear the full wrath of his mystique!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was waiting for this very moment. Once the person's shadow appeared, before he was able to reorientate himself in this unfamiliar space, Wu Yu was already primed in position at his flank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was then that he released the full might of the Eyes of Fire and Gold's third tier, Sun Vessel! Explode!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With sun's truefire accumulated to the extreme, a tremor could be felt as raging flames compressed to the utmost erupted outwards, forming a deep golden pillar of flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moving at the speed of light, covering a distance of not more than one zhang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had already made significant preparations to fire his mystique. This pillar completely engulfed the individual whose shadow had only just appeared. He was directly swallowed up by the Sun Vessel!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long had once mentioned that its name was derived from the fact that the Eyes of Fire and Gold could steal the sun's truefire, compress it, and then emit it out with a force that could even penetrate the sun!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pillar arced across the sky like a rainbow!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hitting the opponent squarely, Wu Yu did not pause to figure out who it was or the result of his attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All he knew was that this thunderous Sun Vessel had knocked the opponent flying. Whether he had killed the opponent or merely injured him had yet to be seen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Glimpsing by quickly, he could barely make out the person's appearance. It was blurry, but he could barely make out a piercing symbol in between the person's eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wu Yu was unable to make out what the word was. All he knew was that whoever dared to come in was not someone trivial. Yet after entering the pagoda, faced with the turbulence of time inside being 50 times quicker, the person was unable to adapt as quickly. His own body was clearly adapting to the circumstances and thus had suffered the brunt of Wu Yu's sneak attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Go!" Wu Yu did not hesitate to speak, and once his eyes regained a sense of normality, he immediately made his way out of the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He still did not have a good understanding of the effects of the Sun Vessel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Though seeing as the person who had been swallowed by the pillar of flame had been knocked flying over 10 zhang and even collided heavily with the Time Control Pagoda's walls, resulting in one of his shoulders being smashed into a mess of gore and blood, it could be said that its might was at the very least domineering!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The opponent must clearly be someone strong, and likely someone I have yet to meet. Facing such an expert, the effects of the Sun Vessel aren't bad."</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Even if it didn't manage to force the opponent out of the Taigu Immortal Path, the effects were still satisfactory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet at this point in time, that person began to radiate an intense gold light as he flared up in flames. Just before Wu Yu escaped, he could feel the fury and how frightening the individual could be! &nbsp;How could he have imagined that the individual that had entered had well surpassed the limits of his imagination!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He opened his fist and swiped at the air, his eyes emotionless. It was like a god reaching out and grasping towards Wu Yu. He did not know where this commoner had come from, actually daring to disrespect him. He would demonstrate the might of the Ancient Emperor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was too late.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was one step ahead and had already left. Relying on the ambush of the Sun Vessel, combined with his advantageous position, by the time the opponent wanted to catch him, it was already too late!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wu Yu left, the door immediately sealed shut. It was as though it had never existed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Prince Le, who had ironically now been trapped within, was absolutely nonplussed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This sort of individual in such a situation... is truly unprecedented, hehe… He even dared to try me. How amusing."</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wu Yu had no idea who he had just faced and what sort of reaction he had. And what awaited him was an entirely new level of danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was relying on the unexpectedness of his appearance to gain an advantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who would have expected a sneak attack that would work the moment they entered, considering the difference in strength?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he escaped from the pagoda, just who would have expected Wu Yu to appear instead of the Prince, considering his heaven-defying might?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Frankly speaking, Prince Le had entered the pagoda with time flowing 50 times quicker. Thus, to the people outside, it had been barely a blink since Prince Le had entered and Wu Yu had rushed out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point in time, Wu Yu attempted to anticipate how the others outside would react to someone coming out. Firstly, he smothered himself in gold flames, preventing others from directly identifying him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This way, they could possibly think that he was the very same person who had just gone in, perhaps just being knocked out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Normally speaking, this was completely unbelievable, but since the group had absolute faith in Prince Le, how would it cross their minds that it would be Wu Yu who came out? Thus, within the group of 30, no one had suspected even an inkling that it could be Wu Yu, considering the fact that even the flames looked similar to what they used!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Scram!" It was at this point that the fire surrounding Wu Yu gradually dissipated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The one directly in front of him was Jiang Qijun. She had requested to enter the Time Control Pagoda but had been rejected. Just as she was feeling dejected, Wu Yu had appeared right in front of her, Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean in hand, directly bashing it towards her cranium.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Violent Art!" With the combination of the Unbeatable Dragon King Buddha Body and the Violent Art, his physical prowess swelled to a level completely unseen in the Jambu Realm! A single fierce and ruthless strike! Jiang Qijun, in her astonishment, almost got clubbed straight on by Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she noticed it was the Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean smashing towards her, she instantly knew it was Wu Yu and instead casually blocked with her arms instead. With that horrific strength, it directly broke both her limbs!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two sounds of&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">ka cha</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;were heard as the limbs hung loosely in an awkward position!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu!" Jiang Qijun screamed in torment, her voice laced with anger and fear. He had brought about an unthinkable situation!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Honestly speaking, everyone was shocked. This was completely impossible and just too sudden. They were all momentarily stunned!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, people were wondering. Was this a joke? How could that be Wu Yu!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were thinking that it might have been a puppet created from within the Time Control Pagoda. They had first thought it was Prince Le.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Prince Le would definitely not harm Jiang Qijun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, once the fire wreathing him disappeared, they could see that this person possessed the likeness of that scum who had stolen their Fire Source Ancient Crystal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But this was too unlikely. Their minds were completely blank. Just how could Wu Yu have escaped?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that momentary daze, Wu Yu had beaten Jiang Qijun away and had escaped the encirclement. In another blink, his dao treasure was stowed away and countless doppelgangers materialized and escape in every single direction, with his main body well within the mob.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Please pardon me, I have to go. I just have to say one thing. The Fire Source Ancient Crystals have all been absorbed by me. If you don't believe me, you can clearly see how much I've improved. Goodbye!" These were the parting words left by Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's single strike was able to harm Jiang Qijun. He had suddenly and mysteriously improved by strides, and he believed that once the group calmed down to analyze the situation, they would believe him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By the time he left those words behind, his numerous clones had already scattered in the wind. With his Swift Art, combined with the improvement to his physical body and Primordial Energy, his speed erupted at an even more terrifying pace than before. At the very least, someone like Jiang Qijun would be unable to catch up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, he had the interference of his doppelgangers to distract them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Wu Yu had prepared to disperse his doppelgangers throughout the entire cloud layer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, it looked as though 1,000 different individuals were running for their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Wu Yu's own improvements, the clones had naturally also advanced in capabilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this chaotic situation, the super geniuses of the Yan Huang Ancient Country gave chase momentarily before halting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a Wu Yu running in each and every direction. Wu Yu had become stronger and the clones had improved in speed. Even if they chased relentlessly, the odds of catching him were miniscule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, the endless cloud layers also served to hamper their sight. It was not as easy to spot someone like in the dark sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That person just now... was Wu Yu..." The geniuses began to face each other. Seeing Jiang Qijun's alabaster pale face combined with the severe injuries to both arms, it was a completely unbelievable sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It should be him after all, considering the number of clones. Only he possesses such means. However, didn't Prince Le go into handle him? How could he have escaped? Prince Le hasn't come out, so could it be that the pagoda doesn't require one to fight?" At this point, they surrounded the white pagoda, but it had suddenly and mystically disappeared before their very eyes without a sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It has vanished!" Everyone was in a state of stupor. It was too sudden and it seemed like everyone had become dumb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu still had clones that had yet to escape too far, but he had also noticed the pagoda disappearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's no wonder no one had discovered it before. It seems like it moves after after a period of time,"</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wu Yu hypothesized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His main body had already escaped a large distance away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What he was truly fearful of was that the geniuses of the Yan Huang Ancient Country would continue to stay together as a group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Prince Le entered and Wu Yu came out. He even mentioned that the ancient crystals have been utilized. Just what should we do?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't listen to his rubbish. How could he have possibly used it up? Furthermore, the quantity was massive!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"However, we just clearly saw that his performance has improved greatly. He has even entered the fifth tier of the Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea. That is his true cultivation level. Which such a cultivation level, how could he have the strength to harm even a hair on Jiang Qijun? Furthermore, who could know how far he has improved in the past 10 days!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The audience all looked in Jiang Qijun's direction. They all knew how capable she was, and this thought that Wu Yu had improved so much was absolutely inconceivable. Yet the sight in front of their eyes was truly a heavy injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What's the point of discussing this? We need to find him and obtain the crystals from him. Today, our Yan Huang Ancient Country's geniuses have once again been humiliated. This is unforgivable!" Jiang Qijun said with gravitas.</span></p>
