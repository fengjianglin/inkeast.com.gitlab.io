 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Purgatory Chains combined with the Oblivion Beast Soul Shocking Techniques of his 1,000 clones - this was basically two of Wu Yu's Great Dao Mystiques used in sync!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eyes of Fire and Gold and Unshackled Doppelganger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were two mystiques from the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal, and were Wu Yu's strongest moves currently. While the Three Fields Ghostly Sage was underestimating him, he was immediately barraged by strong hits from the two mystiques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When his mind was blank and confused, and his spirit under heavy assault, Jiu Ying's nine heads formed a unique spirit design. The nine huge mouths surrounded him, chanting the Nine Hells Reincarnation Scripture in unison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, Wu Yu had finished his own mission. The rest was up to Jiu Ying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before, the Nine Hells Reincarnation Scripture had controlled the ghostly cultivator with ease. Right now, the Three Fields Ghostly Sage was seriously besieged by Wu Yu. That was why, although the Three Fields Ghostly Sage was much stronger, Jiu Ying's Nine Hells Reincarnation Scripture had already been mostly chanted through. The nine heads mouthing the script at once affected even Wu Yu, although he was not bearing the direct brunt of the attack. Even he felt his own soul being scrambled and becoming a little muddled, let alone the Three Fields Ghostly Sage, currently in the midst of all nine heads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Jiu Ying's Natural Mystiques are the Spiral of Disaster, the Gates of Hell, and the Nine Hells Reincarnation Scripture. These can be counted amongst the strongest mystiques out of all that I have seen."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's consciousness was starting to revive a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In order to firm up control over the Three Fields Ghostly Sage, Jiu Ying continued to repeat the Nine Hells Reincarnation Scripture a few times to reinforce it. He branded his control firmly over his soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Until the Three Fields Ghostly Sage's eyes were completely empty, and without a single spark of consciousness. Clearly, he had succeeded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, Jiu Ying was rather weary. After it was completed, he panted for quite a while, his face pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If you have any questions, you can ask him now. I'll rest a while." He had used his mystique more than twice, so he was a little unsteady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Jiu Ying rested, Wu Yu turned directly to the Three Fields Ghostly Sage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who vacantly simpered back at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu did not hold back, asking directly, "Do you know about the Godly Sea Steadying Needle?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Three Fields Ghostly Sage grinned at him foolishly. "You mean the Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean?" Wu Yu started. He thought about it. Perhaps this was the real name of the Godly Sea Steadying Needle. The so-called Godly Sea Steadying Needle was only a label on it after all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean is the Godly Sea Steadying Needle. A dao treasure! It has been passed down amongst the ghostly cultivators for a very long time. It has endured for as long as Emperor Yan's Hall. It's said that the Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean was actually a martial cultivator's dao treasure, and is extremely unwieldy for ghostly cultivators to use. That is why, after Emperor Yan's Hall's elders obtained it, they crushed it in the vortex of the East Sea Swirls, allowing Emperor Yan's Hall to abide in the place with the densest spiritual qi in the heart of the East Sea!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed like the Three Fields Ghostly Sage was well-informed. At least much more so than the ghostly cultivator from before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Godly Sea Steadying Needle was actually a martial cultivator's dao treasure. Wu Yu had always assumed it was a ghostly cultivator's weapon, a dreadful weapon stained with blood, and with many spirits dedicated to it. A weapon built on a mountain of corpses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This Godly Sea Steadying Needle. What else do you know? Go on." Now that Jiu Ying needed rest, Wu Yu had to wait for him to recover fully before journeying on to Emperor Yan's Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Three Fields Ghostly Sage was completely under his sway, treating Wu Yu and Jiu Ying as though they were his masters. He answered subserviently, "I know that the Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean has always been crucial to Emperor Yan's Hall. But although it is a dao treasure, even the eight Emperors of Emperor Yan's Hall have not been able to blood bond with it because it abhors ghostly cultivators. It has been guarded for countless years. If the Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean is moved, Emperor Yan's Hall will be torn to pieces by the East Sea Swirls."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If we enter Emperor Yan's Hall, can you bring me to the position of the Godly Sea Steadying Needle?" Wu Yu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Of course I can. It is not difficult. After entering, one can see the huge Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean by descending deeper into the vortex! It is very obvious!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who are the experts currently guarding Emperor Yan's Hall?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The eight Emperors have turned out in full strength; all the Ghostly Sages also wish to head for the divine continent. Only about three or so Ghostly Sages remain. Like me, they were forced to remain. Like me, they are restless and have nothing to do."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, a mood was upon the Four Islands of the East Sun. The ghostly cultivators that remained were either cowardly and afraid, or forced to remain. It seemed like those of Emperor Yan's Hall were not in the least bit afraid that anyone would strike at them from the back - leaving only three Ghostly Sages.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed like a token gesture at best.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the banner of the Ghostly Emperor, few wished to remain here. Even the weakest of ghostly cultivators fervently wanted to go and conquer the divine continent. Those that had stayed here were naturally discontent. Their only consolation was that the eight Emperors might bestow some boons upon them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"These three Ghostly Sages. How strong are they?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Much stronger than I am! Two are at the ninth tier of the Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea! One is a tenth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was indeed no less than Wu Yu had expected. No matter how lax the eight Emperors were, they would definitely leave a couple of competent ones to guard their rear in case someone like the Devious Shadow Ghost Sect decided to try something funny. The Ghostly Sages or Sword Sages at the tenth tier of the Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea Realm were already quite formidable. For example, Shushan's own Lunar Flower Sword Sage was only a ninth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator, while the Grand Architect Sword Sage was at the tenth tier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wu Yu's aim was not to fight them head on. He had Ba She as an asset. Although not fully under control, if used well, he could be incredibly effective!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What powers are needed to take away the Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean? What are the safeguards set by the eight Emperors?" This was the most crucial question. Before moving out, Wu Yu had to know every last detail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Three Fields Ghostly Sage pondered on this. "In the outer perimeter of Emperor Yan's Hall, there is the 10,000 Ghosts Immortal Extinguishing Design with 10,000 ghosts guarding it. Even an immortal could not fight their way in. As for the inner perimeter of Emperor Yan's Hall, no one has dared to approach the Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean, but it's said that there is a spirit design that can stop ordinary disciples from getting close, although it probably cannot stop you two. As for what spirit design it actually is, I have no idea. In any case, no one dares to go near it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was a curveball.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Wu Yu had to go. At this stage of the plan, there was no backing out. So he had to force this point. After all, he and Jiu Ying were not weak. If needed, they could also borrow Ba She's strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The next few questions he asked clarified many of the specifics, such as what the three Ghostly Sages specialized in. And then they waited for Jiu Ying to recover. After about four hours, Jiu Ying was back to his normal self. After recovering, the Three Fields Ghostly Sage was even more under his control. Seeing the Three Fields Ghostly Sage bob and bend to Jiu Ying respectfully made Wu Yu again feel the impressiveness of Jiu Ying's mystique!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Let's go."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, the Three Fields Ghostly Sage led the way. The pair put on blood-stained black robes that ghostly cultivators wore, following unobtrusively behind the Three Fields Ghostly Sage, heads lowered. The trio headed in the direction of the East Sea Swirls. Before long, they reached the great whirlpool, roaring in its magnificence! Truly one of the wonders of nature!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was barely anyone around, and basically no one watched them approach the central location of the East Sea Swirls. News of East King Palace had yet to leak, thanks to the Three Fields Ghostly Sage's threat. The ghostly cultivators were still waiting, mouth agape, for the Three Fields Ghostly Sage to finish Wu Yu off and bring the supreme immortal treasures home.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had to be said that Wu Yu had reaped much this time. Just the 2,000 supreme immortal treasures alone were worth a considerable sum. However, these were ghostly cultivator immortal treasures, so they had to be discounted. And then there was the treasures on the Three Fields Ghostly Sage's body, which were now Wu Yu's. A pity that Ba She had swallowed the things on Shen Kong. Who knew where they were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The waves of the East Sea Swirls were ferocious, and they rose dozens of zhang, as though about to devour the sky. Any mortal who reached this place would die without question. However, accompanying the roiling waves was spiritual qi that melded with the seawater. It, too, came leaping forth. Within the East Sea Swirls were many underwater demons, although their allegiance belonged to Emperor Yan's Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, even the demons were sparse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Passing through the East Sea Swirls, they finally reached the central location. In the murky waters, confronted with powerful waves, was a huge palace cluster that stood in the intersection of lightning and thunder! From outside, all was pitch black. It was as though Emperor Yan's Hall as swaying with the wind and rain, and would be blown apart at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arrived at Emperor Yan's Hall!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Here, they were at the center of the tempest. Lifting their heads, they could see the bloody clouds drifting across the sky, while black lightning flashed amidst the red skies. The stench of filth hung in the air, mixing with the mist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Emperor Yan's Hall was a place where the ghostly spirits roamed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reaching this place, Wu Yu and Jiu Ying shared a look, their eyes burning! This was a risk! It was a battle for the sake of the Dong Sheng Divine Continent! In Wu Yu's heart, it was his first foray at counter-attacking against the ghostly dao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Onward!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the resolution of hot-blooded youth, they neared Emperor Yan's Hall without speaking further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few days back, some members of the Devious Shadow Ghost Sect had tried to force their way through the 10,000 Ghosts Immortal Extinguishing Design. They had been cleaned out thoroughly by the spirit design, and had not even been able to enter Emperor Yan's Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, the trio stood before the gates of Emperor Yan's Hall. The great doors were shaped like a black mouth. Within the mist, it was indistinct, and radiated an insidious energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Three Fields Ghostly Sage marched up. Under Jiu Ying's control, he cleared his throat. "I am the Three Fields Ghostly Sage, who guards the East King Palace. Today, I have some matters which I would like to meet the three Ghostly Sages about. I hope the three Ghostly Sages can let me in!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice was very loud, and should have carried into Emperor Yan's Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghostly Sages held high status within the Four Islands of the East Sun. Each one was an elite presence. And the Three Fields Ghostly Sage was one of the rare few Ghostly Sages who had remained in the Four Islands of the East Sun. He had even met the three Ghostly Sages once before to complain.</span></p>
