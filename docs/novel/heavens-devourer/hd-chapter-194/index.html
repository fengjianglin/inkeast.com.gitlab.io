 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had expended one Homing Soul-Shocker Talisman and taken this female sect leader's life in exchange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Peace was immediately restored, and all fell silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, Zhang Futu had not left. Many had watched the female sect leader killed in battle, but they only shrank back, afraid to appear again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Today, murderous work had been done. Wu Yu would commit this debt to his memory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this silent contest against Zhang Futu was just beginning, and there was no end in sight. Clearly, he was watching Wu Yu like a hawk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After it ended, Wu Yu calmly sheathed his two swords, then lifted his head skyward. He shouted, "I have killed her. Although I used the Homing Soul-Shocker Talisman, life and death have been decided. Do I pass your test?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was aiming to beat him at his own game. He would firstly pretend that Zhang Futu's real goal was to test him. And therefore guise the matter of the Fixed Body Art.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You have no need to make trouble for me. If I am not to your liking, I can return by myself," Wu Yu added.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Haha...." From above, laughter floated down. In a flash, Zhang Futu was standing before him with a beaming face. "Although you indeed used an ingenious method, it does not subvert the spirit of my test. Indeed, you are not craven. Today, your willingness to kill is very much compatible with my tastes."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was difficult to tell if he truly meant this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Could he really not be observing the Fixed Body Art, but simply trying to see if Wu Yu had a cruel hand as he did?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ming Long, what do you think?" Wu Yu asked secretly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're really obtuse. It's so obvious," Ming Long said lazily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What do you mean?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He is definitely lusting after the Fixed Body Art. But this is a cunning guy. He must have already heard of your progress and change at the Heavenly Sword Sect. He must be coveting your Jingu Bang, especially after seeing the Fixed Body Art. He must have guessed that you have an inheritance that is extremely high-grade. Of course, the truth is that your inheritance is far more terrifying than he could ever imagine."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then why does he not kill me and take it?" Wu Yu felt that he had more than enough chances along their journey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long cackled and said, "Inheritances of such an exquisitely high grade must be passed from inheritor to inheritor. Otherwise, wouldn't it be too easily taken away by others? Even you have no idea where the Jingu Bang is on your body. Even if he kills you, he cannot acquire it. He naturally knows this. Besides, he's still guessing for now. I reckon that he wants to keep you by his side and observe you closely for a way to obtain your treasure. Of course, a trashy thing like him has no way to match up to the Ruyi Jingu Bang." Ming Long's words marked him as no good thing. Of course, there was no way that he could possibly succeed, but Wu Yu was not going to open his mouth and clue him in to this fact. This was his most profound secret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You should know that acquiring this treasure invites all kinds of trouble. I died as a result of that as well. If you want to cultivate, then your path will be fraught with risk. It all depends on how you fend off this Zhang Futu." Ming Long feigned indifference, affecting an aloof manner....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having just escaped the demonic clutches of the Ninth Spirit, he had quickly fallen into the designs of this Zhang Futu. Wu Yu could only laugh bitterly to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If I wish to remain and mingle at the Shushan Immortal Sect, the most crucial thing is to hide my treasure well. After all, all those who I've met from the Shushan Immortal Sect so far are the very opposite of my master."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya was a different kind. He took justice very seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Zhang Futu is a troublesome one. But after this test, he probably will not pull any other tricks, at least before we reach the Shushan Immortal Sect...."</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;After defeating such a super strong opponent, Wu Yu could only hope that it had satisfied him for the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At least for now, Zhang Futu was all smiles. Perhaps he had come to terms with it as well - his test had failed, and Wu Yu would keep his secrets to himself for now. Back at the Shushan Immortal Sect, he would have plenty of time to observe Wu Yu at his leisure. For now, he also could not ascertain if what Wu Yu had was truly useful to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He also knew that some of the highest level inheritances could not be obtained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, I, Zhang Futu, have always been cautious about accepting disciples. They must be resilient of character and merciless when killing - just like I am. From these 10 days or so, you are most definitely qualified. Don't worry. This test is over. And now, I will take you back to Shushan Immortal Sect." Saying so, Zhang Futu's hand sketched a gesture and pulled Wu Yu with some mysterious attraction onto his sword energy. He actually let Wu Yu stand on his sword energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long sneered. "What a wonderful change in attitude. One who is unaccountably solicitous must hide evil intentions. It seems like he's prepared to go the distance with you. A false smile to lower your defenses, and then the knife in the ribs once he's figured you out."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even without Ming Long's reminder, Wu Yu knew this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was just like a lamb, being led along beside a starving wolf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hold tight!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Futu said, then he took off!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, it was at Zhang Futu's speed. They soared into the clouds, traveling a 50 kilometers in a breath's time. The wind and clouds blasted past them. If not for Zhang Futu blocking the front, the turbulence generated by their speed would have torn Wu Yu to bits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At such speeds, the winds continued to cut into Wu Yu like knives, even with the Invincible Vajra Body. He still had to use spiritual power to shield his body, and also had to expend significant energy to keep himself attached to Zhang Futu's sword energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I heard from master that this Zhang Futu must be at least a fifth tier Jindan cultivator. That is really powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I wonder how many others of his level there are at the birthplace of sword cultivation, the Shushan Immortal Sect."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Wu Yu was pondering this, Zhang Futu spoke to him conversationally, unaffected by the huge winds. He parted the clouds and traversed the air effortlessly while he spoke in a conversational tone, as if he was having a casual stroll in the air. He started to talk about the Shushan Immortal Sect....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Did Feng Xueya tell you about the Shushan Immortal Sect?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu said, "All he said was that it is the birthplace of sword cultivation, and that it produced immortals before."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Futu roared with laughter, saying, "That Feng Xueya. He was cast out from the immortal sect very early on and knows nothing about the sect. You are different from him. As the disciple of Zhang Futu, you must have some understanding of the Shushan Immortal Sect before you enter. Your current knowledge is too shallow, and will inevitably make you a laughing stock once you arrive. That will reflect badly on myself as well. We will take some time to arrive, so let me tell you what the Shushan Immortal Sect is!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I will be glad to listen." In truth, Wu Yu was quite eager to know about this powerful presence within the Dong Sheng Divine Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Futu began with an even tone, "The Dong Sheng Divine Continent's territories are boundless - thousands of kilometers of plains, and innumerable rich and bountiful regions. The Bipo Mountain Range, for example, is just one of the countless convergences of spiritual qi. With the natural spiritual qi in the environment, sentient beings grow, and even beasts can develop intelligence, becoming demons. More so for humans. Humans cultivate dao and chase immortalhood and longevity. Throughout its endless history, the Dong Sheng Divine Continent's rich tale has continued to develop. The fables are too ancient for us to remember, but amongst its billions of fertile territories, there are a few places which are considered explosive profusions of spiritual qi and deemed rare immortal domains in this world. The highest peak in the Dong Sheng Divine Continent, the Clear Sky of Shushan, is considered one such domain."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu listened attentively, with no interruptions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Becoming part of the Shushan Immortal Sect indicates without a doubt that you are one of the most highly talented martial cultivators in the entire Dong Sheng Divine Continent. You have a higher status than 99% of the martial cultivators. There are tens of thousands of sects ranging through the Shushan Immortal Sect. Some are large, others small. For example, those two sects just now - the moment you flash your Shushan Immortal Sect status, no one will dare to touch you. In this world, the Shushan Immortal Sect is a place for the gods. It is synonymous with nobility. You were born in such a humble place, but you could meet me and become a high level martial cultivator. All I can say is that your luck is exceptional. Simply becoming a member of the Shushan Immortal Sect means that you can walk this world freely in the future."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Futu spoke very pridefully, and this fired Wu Yu's blood as well. Although he hated this Zhang Futu, he still looked forward to the Shushan Immortal Sect with intense anticipation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That place was where his dreams would take flight!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"However, that alone is not enough. After you enter the Shushan Immortal Sect, there is much you need to understand and take note of. The Heavenly Sword Sect is akin to playing house. Laughable. A true superpower immortal sect has strict rules. Hierarchy is absolute and runs as orderly as clockwork. Punishment and rewards are explicated. There is a replete system of law, a complete classification of power, and a fair environment for competition. Firstly, let me tell you about ranks."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Futu cocked an eye at Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Please continue," Wu Yu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Futu's gaze seemed to pierce through him completely. He continued, "People have all kinds of qualities. Even your Heavenly Sword Sect has servants, external, core, and personal disciples. Let alone the Shushan Immortal Sect! At the Shushan Immortal Sect, there are even more rigid ranks! The higher your rank, the more resources and authority you have, and even punishments will differ! In other words, the mightier you are, the more respected you will be! In the world of cultivation, your character cannot sway anything. Only power and dao can crush others!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu recalled that Feng Xueya had told him that Zhang Futu was within the four major sword ranks, which - if he recalled correctly - were called Heaven, Earth, Xuan, and Huang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I heard that you are of the Huang sword rank?" Wu Yu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Futu smiled and said, "Not bad. But in the Shushan Immortal Sect, the Huang sword rank does not count for much. Even you might be able to reach this rank in the future. You will know then."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, he paused, then added, "Actually, the paramount divider in the entire Shushan Immortal Sect is between two realms. This determines if you can ascend the Clear Sky of Shushan."</span></p>
