 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the great success he found in the Inner Vajra Buddha, his corporeal flesh was invincible. Although the Immortal Power of the Great Way rose quickly in his body, Wu Yu could completely control it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Others would take years of adjustment and endurance to achieve it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From before, his last spiritual source was already so close.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the completion of the Inner Vajra Buddha, Wu Yu could already taste the completion of his qi condensation. But he had endured until now, in order to minimize the risk further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another half a day later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Done."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a dry process. Wu Yu had used Spirit Concentration Pills to complete his last spiritual source. With all 10 spiritual sources working, they formed a perfect system of spiritual power. The next step was to condense a Jindan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, condensing a Jindan was a whole school of learning in itself, much more difficult than condensing qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back when he was an eighth tier Qi Condensation cultivator, he had killed 10th tier Qi Condensation cultivators with no problem. And now that he was at the 10th tier, with a hoard of other treasures and dao techniques, fighting off those of the Jindan Dao Realm should be no problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Going from the Qi Condensation Realm to the Jindan Dao Realm is a big leap. I just don't know how big the leap is. And if I am my Master's match at this point...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before, Wu Yu's greatest wish had been to become an expert like Feng Xueya.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who would have thought that his dream was already nearing fruition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And now his sights were set even higher. He would go to the Shushan Immortal Sect to see just how strong their sword cultivators were, and how much grander the scale! How high the foremost peak in the Dong Sheng Divine Continent, Clear Sky of Shushan, really was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Like a newborn baby gazing up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his presence, Wu You's color improved. She moved with grace, her body vigorous. Although she did not have the talent, under Wu Yu's nurturing, she was an expert of the martial way. Combined with the things that Wu Yu had left behind, living to a hundred would be no problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu judged the time, and knew that it was almost farewell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two stood facing each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Go on, then." Wu You was smiling. This was exactly the place where Wu Yu had been dragged out of Capital Wu in the prison carriage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Till we meet again." They had a long time to say all that they wanted to say to each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's mind was made up. His purpose was unshakable. Now, the Shushan Immortal Sect was his only goal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that instant, he turned away, taking to the skies on his sword. He did not look back. If he did, their farewell would be harder, and that was not what Wu You would have wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A pair of eyes burned into his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Until he could no longer be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The path of cultivation is eternal loneliness. Are mortal passions doomed to quail under the cruelty of time?"</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wu Yu wondered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before too long, he spotted Feng Xueya headed towards him as well. Wu Yu could see that he was excited, to the point where he forgot himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Master, he's here?" Wu Yu hurried to ask.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Should be. They're here. And they're very interested in you. They bid me bring you back immediately," Feng Xueya said, a little rushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"They?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed like it was not just one person who had come.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This made Wu Yu a little nervous. Who was it that had come from the Shushan Immortal Sect?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Just like that?" Wu Yu was a little surprised. He had thought that even if they heard his tale, how could they not have seen this caliber of talent, given they were of the Shushan Immortal Sect? They would not be this hasty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya smiled, saying, "Yes, much smoother than I imagined. That Senior Brother Zhang is very interested in you. After you return, acquit yourself well, and he will very likely bring you back to the immortal sect. Wu Yu, this is a golden opportunity. Seize it well."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Matters of the Shushan Immortal Sect were very important to him, and it seemed like he was even more nervous than Wu Yu himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Master, I’ve completed my qi condensation." Wu Yu broke the good news.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Good. Very good." Feng Xueya beamed at him proudly, a satisfied smile bubbling to his lips. He had not been so expressive before, and had been aloof even when they had defended the sect. And now he was like a father sending his son off to the grand examinations, barely able to keep still.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the two hastened back, Feng Xueya told him seriously, "Right, Wu Yu, there is one thing that you must bear in mind."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya said, "Two have come. Senior Brother Zhang and his disciple. I don't know Senior Brother Zhang's abilities, but from what Lan Huayi says, he is qualified to accept disciples, and is at least at a sword cultivator of the Shushan Immortal Sect's Huang sword rank. Those who can reach the four great sword ranks of "Heaven, Earth, Xuan, Huang" must at least be fifth tier Jindan Dao cultivators, so this person is a terrifying expert. Even his disciple, of about the same age as your First Senior Brother, is at the Jindan Dao Realm, and probably even stronger than I am."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was deeply struck. And these were people sent offhand to assist the Heavenly Sword Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had probably only sent that Senior Brother Zhang, and his disciple had tagged along out of hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A random dispatch, and already above the fifth tier of the Jindan Dao Realm. Such was the power of the Shushan Immortal Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu did not understand one thing. Why would such a presence take so long to get here? If not for Wu Yu, this Senior Brother Zhang would have been here to do nothing but collect corpses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Also, Feng Xueya had only told him of these two's powers, but had not told him what it was he was to bear in mind. He waited for Feng Xueya to continue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya continued a little irritably, "The way I see that Senior Brother Zhang, he probably wouldn't trouble to bring you all the way to the west on no good basis. The only possibility is that he has taken a personal liking to you, and wants to take you on as a disciple. You are my disciple, and I'm afraid that Senior Brother Zhang is not happy about that. If he wants to accept you, then he has to be your only master, so...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There must have been something going on there. Perhaps Feng Xueya had guessed at his nature and made suitable adjustments.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing this, Wu Yu had an uneasy feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, although Feng Xueya was irritated, he still said, "I told Senior Brother Zhang that you are just an ordinary disciple with no master as of yet. Of course, I have also notified the sect to keep their mouths shut. From now on, you and I are still master and disciple, but Senior Brother Zhang can never know about this. Otherwise, it will be difficult for you to go to the immortal sect...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were clearly disciple and master. Why did Wu Yu have to go to the Shushan Immortal Sect through this Senior Brother Zhang and have to hide his master-disciple relationship....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing this, Wu Yu could not stand it at all. He shook his head. "Master, I owe you so much. You have made me all that I am today. I hadn’t met you, I would just be a lost waif. How can I forget my roots and refuse to admit my master just for my own future? This, I cannot do. I will enter the Shushan Immortal Sect on my own merit!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Shut your mouth!" Feng Xueya thundered, staring at him. "On your own ability? Forget the fact that entry into the Shushan Immortal Sect is strict - not just talent, but all other aspects as well - but that place in the extreme west is incomparably far. There are innumerable demons and creatures along the way. Given your capabilities, you can't even reach that place. With no master to bring you, even if you can reach the Shushan Immortal Sect, you will only be bullied there! The Heavenly Sword Sect is the tributary of the Shushan Immortal Sect. Only with this identity, and that Senior Brother Zhang guiding and protecting you, can you even have a prayer of staying there!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu remembered that Feng Xueya had never admonished him so sternly before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was still resentful, but he had to admit that Feng Xueya was doing all this for his own good. This was indeed an incredibly rare opportunity. If he was favored by that Senior Brother Zhang, then his future would definitely be smooth. He would not be hovering at the edge of death all the time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But for this, he had to conceal his relationship with Feng Xueya, and call another “Master....” Wu Yu did not mind learning from someone else, but it was unbearable to have to deny that Feng Xueya was his master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya calmed down a little, and spoke sincerely, "Wu Yu, I'm sorry. I was too hasty. But... if you were me, you would know how important this opportunity is to you. If you want to continue on the path of immortals, then you must go to the Shushan Immortal Sect to see the real powers that be.... "&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu looked at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Feng Xueya's eyes, he saw profound expectations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This man indeed wanted him to become better. He had great hopes for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And speaking of that, he was Wu Yu's master, and was now giving Wu Yu away to someone else. He should feel worse, but because of Wu Yu's future, he had made the sacrifice. He too understood that from now on, he could offer Wu Yu little in the way of guidance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Master." Wu Yu considered this a while. In the end, he did not want to negate Feng Xueya's goodwill. Even though he was not too enthusiastic about this plan, he did not reject it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No matter what, the only master in my heart is you. No one else is qualified," Wu Yu said solemnly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He remembered that it was he who had saved him from the roadside and changed his destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He remembered that it was he who had saved him after he had killed Situ Jin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And he had taken Wu Yu on as disciple and helped him rise in the Heavenly Sword Sect, giving him the best resources of cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hearing you say this is enough. After you go to the Shushan Immortal Sect, work hard. If you have the chance, come back to visit this old man, and call me ‘Master.’ That won't be too late either...." Feng Xueya gave a relieved laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a flash, they returned to Bipo Mountain Range. Wu Yu cast his gaze out. Because of the arrival of those two, the entire mountain had changed. All the Heavenly Sword Sect disciples, even the Sect Leader and Sect Protector, seemed lessened....</span></p>
