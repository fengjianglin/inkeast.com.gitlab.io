 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I wonder what this Jindan Cave is made of. The spiritual qi inside is much stronger than at the Futu Mountain Range. It's at least 300 times that of the Bipo Mountain Range. No wonder everyone comes here to condense their Jindan."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, Wu Yu discovered that every single place - the walls, the floor, and even the roof over his head - were all carved with words, and they seemed to be from different hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"All of these are treasures left behind by those who came before. With luck, I might even find a complete, top-quality Jindan Condensation skill!"</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wu Yu heard many say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Everyone, find a place to sit down. There are many newcomers in this period, and we can't just stand by and watch. We can't do anything before finding a spot."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu walked in deeper. He realized that both on the main road, as well as in the chambers, many seniors had left behind their words and feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The dao of the Jindan is the foundation of immortalhood."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Qi Condensation is the first step, and Jindan the second."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Only with Jindan can one form their dao."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some were enigmatic, others straightforward. Reading too much of these made one dizzy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it could not be denied that these words were treasures to anyone who was about to condense their Jindan. Wu Yu had not yet begun to condense his Jindan, so he did not feel them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"A majority of people shut themselves up in a chamber. When they reach a wall, they come out for a walk and a breather, or perhaps to talk to others. First, I'll find a small chamber and try the Great Way of Immortality Art."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu walked randomly, but perhaps because this place was not deep enough in, virtually all the chambers were full. The disciples at the peak of Qi Condensation were all full of enthusiasm as they charged on towards Jindan Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Everyone here is something special...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu walked very deep in, and finally saw a small chamber with two cushions. One of them was still empty, and so he walked in to claim it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other seat was taken by a girl with a red sword lanyard. Her hair was closely cropped, and her expression frigid. Although she wore long robes, they could not hide her nubile figure. Anywhere in Dong Yue Wu, she would be a beauty that could bring ruin to a nation. However, there were just too many beauties in the Shushan Immortal Sect, and Wu Yu had seen hundreds of her like before. Besides, all of them were young, and on the verge of condensing their Jindan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The girl was condensing her Jindan with her eyes closed. Her expression was a little pained and frustrated. Wu Yu had just sat down when she opened her eyes, which flicked over Wu Yu. She snapped at him, "There are so many seats in the Jindan Cave, but you had to come in here to bother me!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke, she rose and left, throwing an irritated look at Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You met with difficulties, but it's my fault?" Wu Yu was a little bemused. He had read&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Rules of Shushan Sect</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">, so he knew that he had done nothing wrong. That was why he had not quarreled with this stranger. And now that she had gone to seek quieter pastures, Wu Yu could not be bothered to answer her either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked up at the room. The four walls were also covered with the writings of their seniors. Some phrases gave Wu Yu deep insight into the Jindan Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu felt like he was 90% confident to condense his Jindan now, with the help of the writings on the walls. However, he still needed time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Zhang Futu cannot enter this place, and there are also so many seniors giving tips. I won't leave before I reach the Jindan stage."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this Jindan Cave, Wu Yu truly felt the benefits and strength of the Shushan Immortal Sect. How could other sects have as wonderful a place as Jindan Cave?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The unknown girl had left for only a short while, and Wu Yu was still preparing to cultivate. Just then, there were sounds of footsteps outside. He craned to look and saw someone enter from outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wu Yu finally got a clear look at her by squinting past the golden light, he was shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The girl who walked in was very young, perhaps 12 or 13 years old. She was about the same age Qing Mang had been when Wu Yu had entered the Heavenly Sword Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This girl was wearing a long skirt of pink, with red flowers adorning it. She had a colorful sash on her waist, and her eyes were large and luminous. Although she was young, her appearance was moving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But to Wu Yu, the thing he marveled at the most was that this little girl resembled the Ninth Spirit, except the Ninth Spirit was more mature and colder. But this girl was still young. She had a pure and lively cuteness to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although she was still small, out of all the girls that Wu Yu had seen, she was the second girl who moved him so deeply. Perhaps in a few years time, she would grow to look like the Ninth Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Finally, a space!" The girl was evidently very pleased to see a vacancy. She hitched up her skirt and ran in, claiming the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was all smiles and sweetness, and Wu Yu replied with a sweet smile of his own. It was an unnerving experience - Wu Yu seemed to be faced with the Ninth Spirit reincarnated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Big Brother, take care of me~" Her voice was very sweet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Mm." Wu Yu calmed himself down. This was still a child, and his thoughts were on condensing his Jindan. He did not dwell on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But at this time, the unknown girl returned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps she had made a round and came back after realizing there were no seats to be had. A pity that the little girl had already taken her spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The unknown girl looked in and was displeased. She said, "Why did you take my spot? Get out quickly and I won't hold it against you. And how did you sneak in, anyway? This is a place for condensing Jindan!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's concentration had been broken. He saw these two girls and suddenly recalled that point. But on closer look, the little girl's spiritual power was strong, and clearly at the 10th tier of Qi Condensation. Her spiritual power was no less than his own! Such an achievement at such a young age. She had to be somebody important!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A pity that the girl from before only saw a young girl in a long skirt and thought that she had snuck in to play.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Being chastised thus, the little girl was a little flustered. She said, "Sis, when I came in, there was no one here."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">According to the rules of Jindan Cave, she had already left, and so the little girl had not stolen her spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu said to the little girl, "You need not bother with her. Since she left, by the rules of Jindan Cave, that spot does not belong to her. One cannot fight in the Jindan Cave, and she cannot do anything to you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh, thank you, Big Brother!" The little girl smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The unknown girl turned and gave an angry look at Wu Yu, who responded coolly, "She's already at the 10th tier of Qi Condensation. Did you assume she did not deserve to be here?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing Wu Yu's words, the girl started and turned abruptly, leaving. Perhaps she too had realized the implications of reaching the 10th tier at such a young age. She must have come from some special background, and was not someone that she could cross.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After she left, peace returned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had only spoken up for the little girl because the other girl had been bothering him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the small favor made the little girl develop some goodwill towards him. She sat cross-legged facing Wu Yu, her bright eyes regarding him. "Big Brother, my surname is Nangong, and my first name is Wei. What about you?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I am Wu Yu." Wu Yu smiled back at her. He knew that this girl might have some special background, but he did not want to purposely get close to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This name matched her looks and smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Big Brother is condensing his Jindan too?" Nangong Wei asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu smiled and nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then Wei Er will compete with Big Brother to see who succeeds first~" Nangong Wei said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright." This girl was still a child, and had an endearing way about her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hehe, Wei Er loves to compete! Let's begin!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Saying thus, she entered a trance. No less than expected of a genius. Although she had just begun, her body was already cloaked in sword shadows as strong as a wall of steel and bronze. Wu Yu was impressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"At her age, she can already do this. She must be something special even in the Common Sword Domain. She must be the disciple of at least a Xuan sword rank?"</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wu Yu guessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not overthink this. He began to cultivate through the Great Way of Immortality Art.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although they were strangers meeting by chance, they would occasionally rest while sitting together for a long time. They would chat, and Wu Yu slowly became familiar with Nangong Wei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To Wu Yu, condensing Jindan should be a long process. After all, this was not condensing qi, which only required Spirit Concentration Pills and enough stamina to endure it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for condensing Jindan, it needed a transformation of the 10 major spiritual sources, gathering them into one at the Sea of Breath Meridian to complete the Jindan Dao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Great Way of Immortality Art is an earth-shaking transformation. It steals the mystical power of the sun and moon. After the dan is formed, it will be supreme above gods and demons!"</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The dan completion mentioned here was the completion of Jindan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Great Way Jindan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Through comparison, Wu Yu realized that the Great Way of Immortality Art's Jindan condensation was different from the usual method of the Shushan Immortal Sect in terms of fundamental quality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ordinary method was to pull the 10 major spiritual sources into the Sea of Breath Meridian one by one in order, slowly condensing them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whereas the Great Way of Immortality Art was much more brutal in manner. It gathered all of them in the Sea of Breath Meridian at once, and then spent a large amount of time simultaneously condensing Jindan. That way, it resulted in a better balance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All in all, Wu Yu found the Great Way of Immortality Art's method more brutal, wild, and risky. It was impossible without a strong physical form. Luckily, Wu Yu had just the body for this. Disciples of the Shushan Immortal Sect all had strong physical bodies built through body refining techniques, but up till now, Wu Yu had yet to see a single body better than his own.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He chose the harder to bear Great Way of Immortality Art. Once he started, there was no turning back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything was for the moment when he would condense dan and become supreme above gods and demons!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I have such qualities and also the Great Way of Immortality Art. I just don't know what quality my Jindan will have. At least it will be a second grade item, and might even reach deep gold. Maybe I'll even have the mist circling it, the highest level!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu began to look forward to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wei was already shrouded in sword qi, colorful clouds covering her. She had already begun, and Wu Yu realized that her Jindan Condensation Wondrous Art was unique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very possibly, she was talented on a whole different level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was seized by a desire to challenge. He remembered the wager that he had struck with Nangong Wei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To compete with this otherworldly talent would be interesting indeed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He began!</span></p>
