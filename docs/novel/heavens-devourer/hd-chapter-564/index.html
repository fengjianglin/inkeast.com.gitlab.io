 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two days later, Wu Yu received a core-tail talisman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Tianyu told him that he had already spread the word, and at least five or more people knew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Also, these five people were at least a little familiar with him. Whether they believed it or not, they had at least agreed to spread the word as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they were enthusiastic, one could easily spread to 10, and 10 to 100. Finally, perhaps most of those that remained here would know.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was much more efficient than Jiang Qijun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Jiang Qijun has probably already forgotten about this matter."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Recalling her, Wu Yu was naturally resentful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Lan Tianyu coming to my aid was truly my luck."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the time that remained, he no longer needed to worry about being unable to spread the word as time ticked on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this period of time, he searched high and low as well. He did not have the network of Lan Tianyu, which was why not many were willing to hear him out. Another thing he realized was that the Spirits of the Universe did not again appear in this limitless sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Could they really all be gone?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without the Spirits of the Universe, many were getting anxious. They rushed around the sea, searching for both Spirits of the Universe as well as exits from the sea region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, no one wished to be stuck here for a full year without reaping any rewards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had also fully activated his Eyes of Fire and Gold as he searched high and low. Actually, he could also try to blood bond with the Emperor's Pagoda, but in this tense atmosphere, he decided to see if there was an exit first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This matter needed patience and endurance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu did not know how many places he had explored. Every place in the sea looked the same to him, and currents very readily swept him away to a new place, completely scrambling the places that he had searched before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could only roam around blindly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not just him, but everyone was also roaming around blindly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another half a month passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was said that not a single Spirit of the Universe had been seen in this period of time, and everyone was panicking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only good news was that Lan Tianyu had informed him that more than 10 people now knew of the issue. Of the few that Wu Yu had encountered, two had grudgingly agreed to hear him out, but their attitudes were about the same as Jiang Qijun's. At least they would tell their elders if they left the Taigu Immortal Path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, if he wanted to save the divine continent, Wu Yu did not need to go to the Yan Huang Ancient Region personally. As for how he would eventually go to the Yan Huang Ancient Region, Wu Yu was not that worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There must be an exit. This place is filled with magical opportunities. Just where could they be?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each day, Wu Yu continued to search with such an attitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While traversing through the vast sea, Wu Yu finally saw two very huge shadows one day, deep in the sea region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What is that?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The shadows seemed to be beckoning towards him. The moment he spotted them, Wu Yu could not take his eyes off them. He carefully moved towards them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Careful." Ming Long seemed to be getting anxious herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, although this sea was huge, nothing this strange had appeared up until now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And when the Eyes of Fire and Gold could see it clearly, Wu Yu would still have a considerable distance between him and the shadow. He had finally seen the true form of the shadow after traveling through so much of the sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What the hell is that?" Ming Long asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Looks like two stone statues sunken into the sea floor. Made out of granite. But...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"But what?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's eyes were flat as he said, "The stone statues are carved in the likenesses of the Thunder, Fire, and, Water Source Crystal Beasts. Every detail is exactly the same, except they are carved out of stone. In terms of size, they're about the same size as the Thunder Source Crystal Beast King that appeared before."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After confirming that there were only two granite statues, Wu Yu was less worried, and approached with speed. When he was about 100 zhang away from the statues, he could see them very clearly. They were indeed carved in the likeness of those spirits of the universe. He did not know who had carved them, but the resemblance was remarkable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who would have left two stone statues here? Was it someone before? Or one of the hundreds of those here? Or is it originally of the Taigu Immortal Path?" Wu Yu was very curious. He circled the stone statues a few times without actually nearing in. He was still wary of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, Ming Long could also sense the presence of these stone statues. She too was looking, although her inspection was much more meticulous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, use your Eyes of Fire and Gold to inspect it carefully. Is this a fabrication? Real stone statues, or something else?" Ming Long suddenly said carefully, her tone prudent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Something else?" Wu Yu had not looked carefully up till now, only focusing on its appearance. He had been simply curious about its appearance. After all, it did seem like a carving of a Thunder Source Crystal Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Ming Long reminded him, he focused on one of the stone statues, concentrating his mind and body into his eyes. They blazed, and all illusions fell away before them. In his field of vision, he discovered that the stone statues had indeed changed. The granite did not seem to be granite at times. Rather, it was liquid, a type of water. As Wu Yu inspected the head, he saw that there was a vague but terrifying power nestled deep within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the Eyes of Fire and Gold could only see this much, which showed just how deep the other face of the stone statue was hidden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He tried again on the other stone statue, this time using even more care to scrutinize and analyze it, especially the head. After about an hour, Wu Yu saw a bunch of fire. This was different from the water just now. This stone statue, too, hid fearsome power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Well? Anything strange?" Ming Long asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, she did not know. But her experience told her that anything that appeared here would be more than met the eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu took a deep breath and nodded, saying, "A little strange. Seems like there's something buried deep within. One is fire-affiliated, the other water-affiliated. Especially at the head - it seems like something extremely terrifying is hidden there."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After considering this for a long time, Ming Long suddenly laughed, saying, "I know what they are. Your doggedly good luck is truly ridiculous. However, you aren't strong enough, so it doesn't really matter how good your luck gets."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What do you mean?" Hearing her say this, Wu Yu was starting to guess what she was talking about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long said, "If I'm not wrong, these two stone statues should be the same as the Thunder Source Crystal Beast King that appeared before. Only, these are the Fire Source Crystal Beast King and the Water Source Crystal Beast King."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These words stunned Wu Yu. The fear-inspiring majesty of the Thunder Source Crystal Beast King was still fresh in his memory!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How is this possible? They must be just statues...." Towards the end, Wu Yu's voice trembled. He did not want to die, so he hurriedly retreated a distance away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He stared at the two unmoving stone statues, reeling. Battered by the currents, Wu Yu thought that they would be swept away, but they were not. This too was evidence that the two stone statues were not ordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Wu Yu's disbelief, Ming Long put her hands on her hips and said proudly, "How ignorant. The Spirits of the Universe live long, much longer than even demons, because they have the ability to enter hibernation. They can cause their own bodies to completely halt, as though they were sealed. For example, these two turned directly to stone. If I'm not wrong, all the Spirits of the Universe were stone before you all arrived. The rest were startled awake, and the Thunder Source Crystal Beast King was awakened as well. And this time, you've found the other two kings. Fortunately, they're not yet awakened. Otherwise, you would be back in the divine continent or in hell already.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The hibernation methods of the Spirits of the Universe are truly strange. Becoming stone statues is nothing extraordinary," Ming Long added.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing this, Wu Yu basically no longer doubted the truth of Ming Long's words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Which was why he was even more aghast. He looked at the two stone statues, unable to speak for a long time. At this time, if the two kings of the Spirits of the Universe were to suddenly awaken, then at such a close distance, Wu Yu could not ascertain if he would be able to escape from their grasp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes landed on the Fire Source Crystal Beast King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Will there be a Fire Source Ancient Crystal 100 times the usual size?" Wu Yu mused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh, yes. Very huge," Ming Long said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If I can obtain that Fire Source Ancient Crystal, does that mean the Unbeatable Dragon King Buddha Body can be completed?" His gaze was hot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long laughed loudly. "In theory, yes. But if you can't divide it up to absorb little by little, you'll be incinerated into ash. Of course, it is far beyond the quantity that you need. But you had better forget about it. The key here is that by the time you can defeat the Fire Source Crystal Beast King, you probably won't need the Dragon King Buddha Body anymore."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why this was only wishful thinking, but impossible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Should I just leave, then?" Wu Yu asked, taken aback.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fact that he could meet the two Kings of the Spirits of the Universe like this was truly a stroke of luck. However, Ming Long had already said as much. He was too weak, and unable to use this opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But no one in his shoes would be content just leaving like that!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What else? Wanna give them a few rubs? You can go ahead. It's not so easy to awaken them. They look to be in deep sleep. From my experience, unless you attack them full force, you won't be able to rouse them. The Thunder Source Crystal Beast King was the same way as well."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since there was no imminent danger, Wu Yu wanted to go up close for a look. To him, the Spirits of the Universe were miraculous existences!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If you can split your second primordial spirit and control the egg of the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord, then your other body will be a Spirit of the Universe. Wait for that day. Your second body might be even more incredible than your original."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long advised him patiently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was, of course, waiting for that day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, he was standing right beside the stone statue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What is this?" He pointed to something near the rear of the stone statue. There was a pile of stone-like things in an oddity of shapes. They seemed like a messy group of ball-like objects stuck to the ass of the stone statue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long stuck out her tongue, saying, "Can't you tell? Of course, after all this time... the shit of the Spirits of the Universe!"</span></p>
