 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had overheard numerous discussions regarding the Taigu Immortal Path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of the most important pieces of information was that there were unlimited potential changes within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Anything could happen. There was always a minute possibility of any sort of outcome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had always kept this thought in mind. Thus, even if there were sudden upheavals, he would remain unperturbed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Anyone curious will definitely approach the disturbance."</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wu Yu could already see that individuals from all directions were converging there as such.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if they were swept away by chaotic currents, these fellows would continue to rush forward like fireflies into the light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was likely that when this disturbance was at its peak, an unparalleled treasure would appear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were a few individuals in his surroundings that had zoomed past him. Everyone seemed unwilling to tangle with anyone else, focusing purely on arriving at the source.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Just what has appeared?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I can feel a terrifying pressure. It doesn't seem like it’s from one of us. Perhaps a demon has gone insane, or perhaps a new type of Spirit of the Universe has appeared. As I previously said, how could a place like the Taigu Immortal Path be so peaceful and simple?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Indeed, it seems the storm has arrived. Wanting to hunt leisurely in this place is just a pipe dream!" As Wu Yu approached the source of the disturbance, he overheard these words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was extremely close to the location, and he could have arrived sooner. However, considering the dangers that potentially awaited, he slowed down. He did not want to return to the Dong Sheng Divine Continent so quickly, and even Duomingshan Shengxue had been sent out merely a few days after entering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The closer he approached, the more the sea water roiled. Small, serpent-like lightning bolts could be seen increasing in density within the sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was unperturbed with his ridiculously strong body combined with an armor dao treasure. Yet when these lightning bolts drilled into his body, it brought about alternating waves of sharp pain followed by numbness. The closer he got to the area, the more intense the feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Towards the end, as far as the eye could see, all was a sea of lightning. Only with the help of the Eyes of Fire and Gold was Wu Yu able to see through the static and continue pressing on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">ROAR!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was at this point that the roar of a huge beast could be heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was incomparably violent, and just the roar caused the entire sea to roil, bringing a sense of crisis to all. Even the serpent-like lightning bolts were thrown into disarray as they seemed to squirm. It seemed as though the entire world had descended into a state of chaos.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu basically understood that there were at least a 100 other cultivators and demons at the location of the roar. After which, the commotion seemed to have intensified as the sea waves rolled with renewed intensity. There was clearly a battle of sorts occurring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu carefully made his way through the sea of lightning, his patience greater than that of the average cultivator. Gradually, as he entered the deeper regions, he could see that the cultivators had surrounded a huge beast.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What surprised him was that it was actually a Thunder Source Crystal Beast, except it was several hundred times larger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It has to be said that the Thunder Source Ancient Crystal was also several hundred times larger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If such a huge ancient crystal was obtained by Wu Yu, it would bring about immense riches. After all, if a small Thunder Source Ancient Crystal was worth a dao treasure, then what would one that was hundreds of times larger be worth? A priceless treasure?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One could see how precious the treasure in front of them was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, the cultivators that could surround it were likely the Jambu Realm's top 100 cultivator geniuses. Each and every one of them was a Primordial Spirit Transformation Realm expert. Yet all of them held frenzied looks on their faces as they possessed untenable greed and hopes towards possibly owning this treasure. They seemed to have become more restless as all of them continued to eye the Thunder Source Ancient Crystal as though it was the most valuable treasure in the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu did not approach at first. He was unable to join this rumble as all these cultivators were akin to giants to him. There were also numerous cultivators like him, eyeing the prize, waiting for a suitable opportunity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Eyes of Fire and Gold allowed him to see clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Thunder Source Crystal Beast could be known as the king of Thunder Source Crystal Beasts!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long sardonically replied, "As expected of the Taigu Immortal Path. Even a Spirit of the Universe of this magnitude could appear. Of course, this could only happen in this mysterious Taigu Immortal Path. Only it could give rise to such phenomenon! This is the agglomeration of tens of thousands of years that allowed the heavens to create such a miracle. The long lives of these beasts truly do give rise to envy." Even someone like Ming Long gave praise to this sight - it was truly extraordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a pity Wu Yu had nothing to do with it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His priority was to protect himself and to remain cautious. At this point, with his Eyes of Fire and Gold, he was able to see the scene in front of him clearly. Within the group of cultivators, he was able to see the golden-robed lady flanked by 10 others. Judging by their body language, it seemed that they were all close and were people from the Yan Huang Ancient Country, gathered by this situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu hoped she would share the news of the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord with the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, these individuals only held fervent gazes towards the huge beast's body. There was no time for the woman to share the news, and she didn't even believe the information.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Overhearing their conversation, Wu Yu was able to hear that the golden-robed woman was known as Jiang Qijun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Jiang Qijun, I will remember it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very quickly, the group from the Yan Huang Ancient Country entered the battle. On one hand, they wanted to conquer the Thunder Source Crystal Beast King. On the other, they wanted to defeat the other geniuses! Amongst this group, Jiang Qijun was not the strongest. The Yan Huang Ancient Country possessed even mightier individuals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A frightening and chaotic battle unfolded before Wu Yu's eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It has to be said that even the Yan Huang City Lord, the Taixu Sage Master, and the other experts from the Dong Sheng Divine Continent could not compare in might when they surrounded the Ghostly Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, there were over 100 cultivators and demons engaging in battle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were not only attempting to kill the Thunder Source Crystal Beast King, but also to fight amongst themselves! The battlefield was a complete mess as numerous dao techniques, Great Dao Mystiques, and dao treasures flew in every direction. The scariest part was that each and everyone of them possessed multiple dao treasures that were peak grade!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they seemed to have underestimated the ferocity of the Thunder Source Crystal Beast King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Spirit of the Universe's battle strength was hard to fathom. More often than not, they did not possess a cultivation level and were countless times more mighty than what one thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Take for example the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His devouring ability was unimaginable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This huge, mighty beast's ability to control thunder and lightning was also something rare in this world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regardless of how many dao techniques, dao treasures, Great Dao Mystiques, talismans, and such were thrown at it, with a single manipulated strike of lightning, those geniuses' means were knocked away, unable to even suppress this beast by an inch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">ROAR!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Being surrounded, the Thunder Source Crystal Beast King, which was wreathed in immense bolts of lightning, emitted raging amounts of lightning in all directions, turning the entire sea into a lightning lake! It had a diameter of 1,000 kilometers, leaving no trace of sea water within. It had all vaporized, leaving only this berserk lightning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of it had turned into a purple lightning lake!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, the range of this lightning lake still continued to increase!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It looked as though the heavens and earth had become infested with lightning snakes. This was truly a perilous situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only when one was in the Taigu Immortal Path could one see such a development.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The geniuses from the Jambu Realm were extremely valiant. When the Thunder Source Crystal Beast King demonstrated strength equivalent to the sixth tier of the Primordial Spirit Transformation Realm, they temporarily stopped their infighting and poured all their effort into defeating it. They all possessed Taigu Immortal Talismans and were unafraid of a little danger. In the worst case, they would simply leave, but if they were lucky and retrieved the Thunder Source Ancient Crystal, that would be like a pie falling from the heavens!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, in the very center of this battlefield, there was something that even Wu Yu's Eyes of Fire and Gold could not successfully peer through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Explosions and shouts resounded everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hundreds of dao treasures were flying through the sky, heavily crashing onto the Thunder Source Crystal Beast King's body. One basically couldn't tell what belonged to who.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline"><span class="Apple-tab-span">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The numerous demons transformed into their true forms, directly engaging into a melee with the Thunder Source Crystal Beast King. In a blink, 40-odd huge beasts appeared. Wu Yu could vaguely make out that the Torch Dragon and Ying Huang could not even be compared to any one of those demons in terms of strength! And these were only youths!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even when it came to bloodlines, they were not any worse!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, a large portion of them were sea region demons. There were sharks, whales, crabs, and prawns, all with precious bloodlines, born as demons! Some of them possessed legacies that exceeded 100,000 years old!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this reckless battlefield, Wu Yu's strength only allowed him to maintain the position of a spectator. He could not interfere, and if he dared to approach, he would undoubtedly be grievously injured by the cultivators or the Thunder Source Crystal Beast King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battle was too intense, and Wu Yu could only resist the urge to fly over and be a part of it. Many individuals like him surrounded the battlefield, some even at the Primordial Spirit Transformation Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang, bang, bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cracking noises were continuously heard each time the Thunder Source Crystal Beast King manipulated bolts of lightning to smash onto its opponents. Even though he was at the perimeter, Wu Yu had to utilize all his strength and his armor to resist the aftershocks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What point is there in me staying here?"</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;He knew that it was an impossible task to steal the Thunder Source Ancient Crystal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Logically, he should quickly make his move and leave. However, everyone felt disgruntled and wanted a share. People only continued to arrive and no one left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone had struggled to this point, hoping to fall upon a lucky chance. Everyone felt that they might just get a lucky break.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if they couldn't, they would know who the one who managed to take away the grand prize was!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps everyone thought the same way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, the Thunder Source Crystal Beast King raged. One of its legs fell off its body and exploded!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an unprecedented scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The explosion was massive, and innumerable large, serpent-like black lightning bolts shrouded the surroundings. In fact, with the beast's skill in manipulating lightning, it almost seemed as though these bolts of lightning possessed sentience! There were over 1,000 of them as they surged into the surroundings in a frenzied fashion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cultivators closest to it bore the brunt of the attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even those not in the battle did not escape unscathed. Wu Yu, for example, was faced with a single black lightning bolt. In a flash, it appeared in front of his eyes like a gaping mouth open, planning to swallow Wu Yu alive! What was most troublesome was that when Wu Yu attempted to strike it with his Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean, the lightning serpent coiled around the staff and struck Wu Yu directly!</span></p>
