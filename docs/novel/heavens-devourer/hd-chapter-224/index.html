 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps it was because the Corpse Flower was too horrifying. Despite knowing it could be sold for a high price to a ghostly cultivator, no one dared to fight with Wu Yu over it in broad daylight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If one had encountered it by himself, they might have risked it under the temptation of monetary benefits.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within this ancient battlefield, the general direction was still controlled by Huang Feiyun and Zhu Zixing. If one could get something out of it by picking up the leftovers, that would be considered really lucky too.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, some of them still threw glances of envy over from time to time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To become a Shushan disciple was perhaps the dream of many on the ground. It was just that they had been eliminated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu and Nangong Wei exchanged glances. Wu Yu asked, "Do you have a better solution?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wei shook her head and answered, "Nope. Let's just cut it down and grab it with our Sumeru Pouch. Let's do it with our spiritual immortal treasures and not get near it."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were afraid of getting poisoned by the Corpse Flower and getting devoured by it if they got too close.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I guess that's all we could do now."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu and Nangong Wei kept their distance from the Corpse Flower. After verifying that the vines of the Corpse Flower couldn't extend to their position, Wu Yu then controlled the Sword of the Blazing Rainbow and Sword of the Mystic Eye with his Art of Sword Control to pierce towards the roots.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu wanted to pull out the Corpse Flower by the roots.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sword of the Mystic Eye was the sword of the vajra and was extremely sharp, while the Sword of the Blazing Rainbow had raging, scorching flames that were the best counter against the evil and creepy Corpse Flower. When these swords approached, the Corpse Flower let out incessant, piercing shrieks. Large numbers of vines rolled up as it attempted to hit the swords away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Break!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wu Yu was very cautious. Furthermore, the vines of the Corpse Flower were only known for their poison. Its toughness couldn't be compared with spiritual immortal treasures. All one could see were golden lights flashing and flames of seven colors raging. In just a short while, Wu Yu severed that Corpse Flower and even pulled out most of its roots.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once the Corpse Flower lost its support, it fell flat to the ground. After being severed by Wu Yu, it seemed to have lost its power and no longer struggled. It was as though it had died.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was an object with four spiritual marks. It retained its colorful appearance and was inhaling and exhaling spiritual qi through its spiritual marks. One could easily tell that this was no ordinary object.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Done!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that the Corpse Flower had lost its vitality, Wu Yu remarked as he cleared out his Sumeru Pouch with the largest space, "I will need a Sumeru Pouch with a large space in order to fit it." &nbsp;After arriving at the Shushan Immortal Sect, Wu Yu witnessed that the Sumeru Pouches in this place were really huge. The largest of them might even be able to fit an entire mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wu Yu was still wary of touching the Corpse Flower, as it was poisonous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The sect has no use for this Corpse Flower. The reason why it can be exchanged for merits is mainly to reward disciples for destroying it and preventing it from falling into the hands of the ghostly cultivators. &nbsp;In that case, I don't have to be worried about getting a complete Corpse Flower. All I have to do is to bring it back to prove that I have annihilated a Corpse Flower."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu got a little agitated at the thought of being able to exchange this Corpse Flower for over 800 merits. After killing for a long time within the Demons' Abyss, he had only obtained 20 merits. A fox demon that possessed a Natural Mystique was worth a meagre 40 merits. Yet he had obtained a talisman that could save his life and 800 merits this time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rewards were too great.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, he had also obtained the Sumeru Pouch of Huang Lingyun. It wasn't appropriate for Wu Yu to check it right away. Nonetheless, there would definitely be a substantial amount of treasures in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The advantage of merits was in the fact that once one could gather a certain amount, they could be exchanged for countless treasures from Shushan. There was a wide variety of treasures, and one could definitely find something that he would need!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Argenti Chain." He threw out the Argenti Chain and extended it greatly to wrap the corpse flower into a ball. After ensuring that the Argenti Chain had completely sealed it, Wu Yu finally pulled it over slowly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, he pulled the opening of his Sumeru Pouch to the largest possible. &nbsp;The Na Word Array changed accordingly. Using one's spiritual power, one could, in fact, adjust the size. The Sumeru Pouch could be adjusted to the size of its interior space. For example, the one in Wu Yu's hand could be adjusted to the size of two rooms, which would just barely allow the Corpse Flower to be squeezed in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu saw the Corpse Flower as money and assets. Therefore, he controlled it carefully as he placed it within the Sumeru Pouch.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surrounding crowd could only look at Wu Yu in envy. They weren't disciples of Shushan and would have no use of it even if they managed to get their hands on it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wei jumped up in joy and had a radiant smile. "That's great! Now Brother will be able to trade for all the things that you want and learn and the things you are interested in!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that she was so thrilled, Wu Yu unconsciously relaxed a little.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, the accident occurred!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immortal essences were a form of plant, so they typically wouldn't possess intelligence and wouldn't move on their own.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Corpse Flower was extraordinary. Perhaps it was because it had grown by absorbing corpses. Within the four spiritual marks, there was too much deathly energy and grudges. These allowed the Corpse Flower to move as though it was a living animal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its consciousness was similar to the erratic state of evil ghosts, and it had a basic instinct of survival.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was other than beasts, plants and the dead could also become demons. Typically, plants that became demons were more likely to be immortal essences that had turned into demons directly. &nbsp;This Corpse Flower clearly hadn't reached the stage of a demon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ordinary plants, rocks, and similar objects would be much stronger than ordinary demons once they became demons.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as it was about to be fitted into Wu Yu's Sumeru Pouch, the severed ends of the Corpse Flower suddenly ejected a black misty fog towards Wu Yu and Nangong Wei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This happened so suddenly that the two of them couldn't react to it. The two of them immediately tried to dodge, but Wu Yu felt part of this black, misty fog land on him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Vajra Transformation!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that instant, his body turned into gold. When the misty fog landed on him, it wasn't able to penetrate his body. Wu Yu immediately swung it off. Still in shock, he quickened his pace and pulled the Corpse Flower, together with the Argenti Chain that bound it, into the Sumeru Pouch. After which, he closed it and shrank the Sumeru Pouch until it fell onto its hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Argenti Chain had to remain there. Otherwise, the Corpse Flower would wiggle and even break out of the Sumeru Pouch.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After everything ended, Wu Yu did a quick check of himself. As he had activated the Vajra Transformation in time, so the poison of the Corpse Flower had not affected him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Wu Yu's Invincible Vajra Body was much stronger than all the physical bodies he had seen. Even if the poison had penetrated into his body, it would likely not have been able to harm him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wu Yu was worried about Nangong Wei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The accident happened too suddenly and he did not have the time to think about her. Now that he took a glance, he was shocked. Wu Yu saw with his eyes that the black poison had penetrated into Nangong Wei from her forehead and limbs. When he noticed it, it was too late to stop the poison.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother... I'm so dizzy and I can't move..." Nangong Wei's complexion paled rapidly and her eyes dimmed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This gave Wu Yu a scare, and he immediately held onto her. Clearly, she was poisoned by the Corpse Flower.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Antidote Pill!" He still had some Antidote Pills with him. At this moment, he took them out rapidly and fed them to Nangong Wei, who had a ghastly expression. He looked on anxiously. However, after a short while, Wu Yu realized that it was completely ineffective. Furthermore, Nangong Wei's condition seemed to be worsening.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why the Corpse Flower could devour humans was because of this poison. Therefore, it was definitely terrifying. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother, am I dying?" Nangong Wei felt her strength leaving her as she fell into his embrace. She was struggling to even keep her eyes open.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She knew her body’s condition well and said, "The poison is corroding my flesh starting from the viscera. Although I'm not being eaten by the Corpse Flower, it is still going to digest me..."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The situation quickly became a lot worse than what Wu Yu had expected!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the frail and weak Nangong Wei, her complexion and her skin started to dim and even crack. Despite being at the best years of a girl, she seemed to be withering in front of Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It can't be!" Wu Yu was thinking hard. There had to be a solution.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother, I'm so sleepy. I'm going to sleep," Nangong Wei said bitterly with a crying intonation that could break one's heart. &nbsp;This was the most horrifying part about the Corpse Flower. Once a person was poisoned, they could only wait helplessly while being devoured.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, Nangong Wei had taken in quite a bit of the poison.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, Wu Yu's was unprecedentedly flustered. After spending time together, he had seen Nangong Wei as his best friend or even his younger sister. However, now that she was about to die, all he could do was stand and watch. Moreover, it was because of him wanting to get the merits that resulted in her current state...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Holding her in his arms, his heart was discombobulated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't fall asleep, Wei Er. I'll find a way out!" If she really fell asleep, it would be difficult for her to ever wake up again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The poison of the Corpse Flower was corroding and devouring her flesh nonstop.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ming Long!" Under such circumstances, Wu Yu could only think of the experienced and knowledgeable Ming Long. &nbsp;After his shriek, Ming Long stretched her back and appeared in front of him. She asked nonchalantly, "Why did you wake me up from my slumber?" As he completed her sentence, she took a glance at Nangong Wei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The poison of the Corpse Flower." Wu Yu looked at her with begging eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that he was so sincere and anxious, Ming Long pondered for a moment before replying, "Forget it, I wouldn't take advantage of you for this. The Great Way of Immortality Art is the most righteous cultivation art. All evil, vile, and darkness avoid it when in contact. Now that you have cultivated a Jindan, its core is its strength. Not only could the immortal fire be used for refining immortal medicine, but it could also be used to burn all evil energies of the world. Poison is just one of the evil energies. Although I'm not sure if you have sufficient immortal fire, you can still give it a try."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Thank you!" Now that Ming Long and Wu Yu relied on each other to survive, and having spent some time together, Wu Yu found her easier to live with. Perhaps all she was doing was ensuring her revival.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had not expected his immortal fire to have such effects.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without further ado, a white immortal fire appeared in his hand, and he placed it between the chest and stomach area of Nangong Wei. The immortal fire quickly burned away the clothes around the area, revealing Nangong Wei's dried-up skin. When the immortal fire was brought closer, Wu Yu could see a portion of the black substance within Nangong Wei's flesh retreating rapidly. This at least proved that the immortal fire was effective!</span></p>
