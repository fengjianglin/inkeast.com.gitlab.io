 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Wu Yu waited, Shen Xingyu appeared before him again, with her purple robes clinging tightly to her diva-like figure. She smiled, her eyes hungrily roaming over Wu Yu. "My dear little brother, you really surprised your big sister. Today's performance gave me a real shock. You look even more like an ultimate genius than you did the last time."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"For that, I have to thank Sister Shen for your help, guidance, and nurturing." Wu Yu could not help but feel gratitude towards this woman. If not for her, he would still be struggling for his life in Zhang Futu's sinister shadow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Just a small matter for me." Shen Xingyu smiled sweetly, her dimples winking cutely. Her features were considered quite breathtaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was a little nervous. He did not know how the Galaxy Sword Sage would see his battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Almost as though reading Wu Yu's mind, Shen Xingyu smiled slightly. "As for him, he seems to find it acceptable, and is willing to continue observation. But I think that you must pull out an even better performance next time, or it will be hard to sustain his interest."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was taken aback. Who would have thought that the Galaxy Sword Sage's expectations would be so high? He had just begun to gain a little confidence in himself, only to be kept on his toes again. He started to think about what he could have done better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Actually, I think your performance was fairly astounding. It's just this guy who is quite unfathomable. Best not to worry about him, and just focus on doing right by yourself," Shen Xingyu said softly into Wu Yu's ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu nodded, saying, "That aside, I will endeavor to do better the next time I come."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Any words said now were just hot air that might only earn the displeasure of the strange Galaxy Sword Sage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright, use your time well. You're now rank 100 on the Leaderboard of Swords and Immortals. Go forth and acquit yourself." Shen Xingyu waved him off. She herself returned to the sky, but not before pausing to deliver a parting shot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No one interfere with Wu Yu. Let him decide his path by himself."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many were just preparing themselves to come and get to know Wu Yu. Many were disciples of the four major sword ranks who had come from the Clear Sky of Shushan. Hearing Shen Xingyu's words, which were practically the Galaxy Sword Sage's words, all of them were brought to a halt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Heard that? The Galaxy Sword Sage is not very satisfied with his performance!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's going to be good. Let's see how much this Wu Yu can continue to strut. In truth, if not for the Galaxy Sword Sage's favor, he would be nothing at all!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Faced with these sentiments, Wu Yu could only laugh bitterly. He understood that the path of cultivation would always be plagued with judgment. The only thing that decided everything was still his own actions and abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he was strong, then none of what they said mattered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Wu Yu could not seem to fathom the Galaxy Sword Sage. The one who had drastically changed Wu Yu's own fate - what was he actually thinking?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Till date, Wu Yu's only impression of him was a winking star up in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He broke away from the crowd, meeting up with Nangong Wei. She did not speak, but looked at Wu Yu with shining eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Big Brother, you basically brought about a miracle. To you, today's performance must have exceeded full marks!" Afraid that he might be dispirited, Nangong Wei hurriedly gave him some encouragement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Long roads and heavy struggles. This is just the beginning." Wu Yu only had to think of how long the road to immortalhood was to calm himself down. It made him realize that the most important thing was to always take things one step at a time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I should continue to refine my Jindan and train my dao techniques. But I don't have a lot of merits with me now. I must use the remaining sparingly, and I can't afford to go to the Spiritual Sword Palace either. I can't always be cultivating on the road, and I can't go to other sword palaces, on fear of being chased out...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he was worrying about this, Zhang Futu suddenly appeared nearby. He had actually been watching this battle from start to finish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Zhang Futu walked up with a sober and slightly frustrated expression. He said, "Wu Yu, congratulations to you. Your performance today surpassed my expectations. Perhaps only now do I truly realize that you are not someone who I can control. I underestimated you before. My apologies...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a personal conversation, and Wu Yu still considered this person an enemy. Therefore, he said, "It's too late for an apology. Just stay away from me in the future."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Futu winced and said, "No problem. I just came to say that I'm moving on from this. From now on, just forget that this Zhang Futu ever existed. I'll not dare to appear before you again."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was very solemn and a little listless, his defeated expression tinged with worry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You must be worried that when I climb in the future, I will remember this grudge and come to bully you with my status!" Wu Yu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Zhang Futu had not done much to him before, those thoughts had crossed his mind before. To Wu Yu, that had been hard to forgive. After coming to Shushan, Zhang Futu had indeed been too frightening of a shadow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Indeed.... And now I have no other choice but to beg for your grace. After all, when that time comes, I will only be an insignificant character in your life," Zhang Futu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had initially thought of killing him as soon as possible. But here at Shushan, killing somebody - especially a Huang sword rank disciple - was no easy feat. Besides, he was not Zhang Futu's match right now. He still remembered this grudge, but he would set it aside for now as he pursued his own future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Futu's plea had not moved him, but he still said, "Good that you know. If you covet things that do not belong to you, you must pay the price. As for what I decide in the future, perhaps you will not even be in my considerations. And I will not be bothered to look for you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Many thanks." Zhang Futu bowed, then silently left Wu Yu. Seeing his retreating figure, he looked haggard, and it seemed like Wu Yu's performance today had indeed put fear and respect into his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he was at the sixth tier of the Jindan Dao Realm, and a Huang sword rank disciple. He was still higher than Wu Yu in terms of ability and status.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wei said, "Big Brother, that person was asking for it. When you surpass him in strength, you still have to teach him a lesson to vent your anger!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Mm." Wu Yu nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"But today he must have been intimidated by you to become so craven. I think he will avoid you in the future." Nangong Wei giggled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing her words, Wu Yu suddenly thought of a solution to one of his problems. He said, "Since Zhang Futu is playing nice now, and we have nowhere to go, then let's return to Futu Hall. There, I have Kilovolt Peak, and that is the only place where I can cultivate in peace."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every disciple of the Common Sword Domain had their own territory. The rest was either public territory or prohibited areas, or areas like the Demons' Abyss. If Wu Yu wanted to concentrate and cultivate, the Demons' Abyss was not a conducive environment - it posed a definite threat. Besides, the spiritual qi was dark there, and not suitable for refining Jindan. Nor was it a suitable environment for training sword dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed like returning to Kilovolt Peak was the best option.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu knew his own status. He was only being watched by the Galaxy Sword Sage, but this did not mean that his position was higher than that of Huang sword rank disciples. He knew that he was still just an ordinary dan disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright, then let's go to Futu Hall. I'm not afraid of that Zhang Futu!" Nangong Wei nodded. At the Spiritual Sword Palace, they had to pay 10 merits each month, and it was a painful price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And now they had no time to go and earn merits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the two agreed, they returned to Futu Hall on Wu Yu's sword. Wu Yu's speed was much faster now, and he was much bolder in his path. He took much less time. He soon reached the snowy expanses of the Futu Mountain Range, the only place which could be considered his territory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had spent a mere month at Kilovolt Peak in his year at Shushan, and many places were still unfamiliar to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">News of Wu Yu's return had spread through Futu Hall, although many only dared to watch him from afar. Amongst them were Zhou Xuan, Wang Fu, and Zhi Ying. Although the three of them were considered talents at Futu Hall, they did not dare to approach Wu Yu. They could only watch him from a distance with admiring eyes. Of course, there was deep-seated envy and hatred within their admiration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu could not be bothered with them. After returning to Kilovolt Peak, he began to absorb spiritual qi within the wooden hut on the tallest snowy mountain. He refined his Jindan and occasionally worked on his sword cultivation dao techniques. He made progress on both fronts, occasionally interacting with Nangong Wei. The day passed just like that.</span></p>
