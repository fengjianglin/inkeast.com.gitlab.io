 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Let's go!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On Wu Yu's side, the nine surrounded and attacked!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The centurions were each strong in their own right. There were no weak links present. All of them used supreme immortal treasures worth at least 200,000 Golden Essence Pills!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, Heaven Earth Void techniques and Great Dao Mystiques all flew towards the White Fiend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those like Chen Cangsong and Fang Qingliu were adept at the Wood element of the Heaven Earth Void technique. The two combined to create an underwater forest. All kinds of things grew, and even their bodies grew to resemble trees. Even if they were torn down, they could immediately regrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Gong Shuming, he was adept at the Inner Sea Dao Technique. As he used his mystique, the sea roiled, dark ice rising all around!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was much more straightforward, but he was undoubtedly the spear of their attack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because in this battle, he was the closest to White Fiend, and also the one to meet him head on! After all, besides Shushan sword cultivators, there were not many martial cultivators who would be willing to engage in close combat with their opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hmph." Actually, the ghostly cultivators despised Wu Yu and the rest of his bunch. The White Fiend was prepared, and the Thousand-Eye Spirit Beckoning Banner waved over. The thousand eyes on it immediately began revolving, forming a vortex which seemed to contain a void within. Suddenly, there were people beginning to rush out of the Thousand-Eye Spirit Beckoning Banner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Yan Huang Immortal Soldiers are all good materials for making Corpse Puppets and Soul Puppets," White Fiend noted indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Corpse Puppets and Soul Puppets he had mentioned were those things that had rushed out from the Thousand-Eye Spirit Beckoning Banner. The Corpse Puppets were evidently the corpses of martial cultivators. Only God knew what methods he had used to gouge out their eyes, and what sort of poisonous, wicked spirit designs he had placed upon them to preserve the martial cultivators' strength and still be subject to the White Fiend's control. The moment the Corpse Puppets appeared, a noxious stench filled the air. The eye-less Corpse Puppets were extremely terrifying, and a full nine of them appeared, rushing towards the group!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides the Corpse Puppets, there were also Soul Puppets! The Soul Puppets were a cloud of thick, white smoke that constantly formed the eyes and features of a human. They howled and cried and moaned, lunging towards Wu Yu and the others. There were also nine puffs of mist!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Soul Puppets were made with the souls of martial cultivators, probably through means even more cruel and savage than the Corpse Puppets!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No wonder theWhite Fiend was covetous of Wu Yu and the others. He had enough Corpse Puppets and Soul Puppets now! This could very well be his trump card for many years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Watch well. Next time, your bodies will be my Corpse Puppets, and your souls my Soul Puppets." The White Fiend cackled mercilessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One could only imagine how tormenting it must have been for the martial cultivators who had fallen by his hand! They were all brethren from the same divine continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Forget the others, even Wu Yu himself felt that such ghostly cultivators truly could not be let off. It was one thing to kill people, but to torment them for eternity and deny them reincarnation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Soul Puppets were like vengeful spirits, but even more fearsome. They were the souls of martial cultivators, and Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivators to boot. The Corpse Puppets and Soul Puppets' appearance caused them to have to fight one Soul Puppet and Corpse Puppet each. The strength of the Corpse Puppets was fearsome. They immediately blocked the attacks of Wu Yu and the others. They were unafraid of death and pain and let loose earthshaking roars. They came lunging forwards, and the Soul Puppets followed in their wake, sinister and threatening!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We're in trouble!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu immediately knew the danger of their situation when he saw the charging Corpse Puppets and Soul Puppets. Especially the Soul Puppets - they had come to possess them. If the Soul Puppet caught him, even he would have trouble controlling his own body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Xuan Immortal Spirit Petrifying Sword Technique!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had snatched up a sword from his Sumeru Pouch and brought it down on the head of the Soul Puppet, ignoring the Corpse Puppet. The Soul Puppet shrieked and was immediately sliced apart by Wu Yu's second sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the other eight did not have Wu Yu's sword technique. The Soul Puppets moved at terrifying speed. By the time Wu Yu had finished off his own Soul Puppet, the others had been defenseless, letting the Soul Puppets rush into their bodies. Instantly, their eyes were filled with struggle and torment. It would negate at least half of their fighting power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as they were struggling to exorcise the Soul Puppets, the Corpse Puppets had already arrived, a frenzy of slaughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"They're in danger."</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wu Yu was very clear that the Corpse Puppets and Soul Puppets would at least render them unable to deal with the White Fiend, if not kill them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one had expected that the White Fiend would have such a move. At least the Black Fiend did not have such a skill. This also meant that Huangfu Pojun had been unlucky - he had chosen the wrong opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of the Soul Puppets' possession, Chen Cangsong and the others were battling against the Corpse Puppets in agony. The Corpse Puppets were heedless of their own lives and would not die if their hands and legs were cut off. They had to be completely shattered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had no time to go and help them, because at this moment, the Corpse Puppet had reached him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Fiend stroked his chin as he regarded Wu Yu with a half-smile. He had taken some interest in the way that Wu Yu had dispatched the Soul Puppet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Little one, not bad."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had just said this when Wu Yu exploded forth with berserk speed. The Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff crashed down on the head of the Corpse Puppet, the God-Surpassing Heavy Design and Great Explosion Design activating together. The Great Explosion Design contributed greatly, and their enormous strength caused the Corpse Puppet to disintegrate completely!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Corpse Puppet, finished off!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Corpse Puppets were not difficult to deal with per se, but because the other centurions were being possessed by the Soul Puppets, their movements were completely restricted by the Corpse Puppets who did not fear death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Not bad. You're a Jindan Dao cultivator? I don't believe it." The White Fiend had originally thought that the Corpse Puppets could finish these people off. He was just about to go over to the Yan Huang Warship to take it for himself. Who would have thought that Wu Yu would immediately finish them off and appeared before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a glance, Wu Yu saw that the others would be of no help, so he steeled his heart. "You'll know if you try me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Fiend was shocked and then gave a cold laugh. The Thousand-Eye Spirit Beckoning Banner waved towards Wu Yu and then he started to float towards Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the Yan Huang Warship, they could see the events unfolding outside. Seeing Wu Yu engage the White Fiend in solo combat, the Heaven's Equal Camp soldiers were shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Commander Wu, retreat quickly!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their faces were green with shock. The news of the Black White Double Ghosts had spread quickly within the ship, that these were two demons of extreme power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Soul-Leeching Gaze!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Fiend sneered as he neared. His eyes suddenly changed, causing even his pupils to turn completely white. With his eyes a sea of white, he looked like death itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a Great Dao Mystique!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, Wu Yu's entire mind was under torrential battering. His entire world started to dissolve into chaos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Faced with this sort of mentally disrupting Great Dao Mystique, Wu Yu's experience was to Visualize the Inner Ape. This was equivalent to the White Fiend trying to disturb the mental world of the Unparalleled Monkey King. When Wu Yu saw the Unparalleled Monkey King, bathed in the fire and flames, he immediately fixed his eyes on the White Fiend within his world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How's this?" Wu Yu stared at the White Fiend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Fiend was shocked. He had not even opened his mouth to speak, when his entire world was consumed in golden flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Soul-Leeching Gaze was useless in trying to harvest Wu Yu's soul!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Weng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu hefted the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff and lashed out with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang, bang, bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a flash, he had crossed weapons with the Thousand-Eye Spirit Beckoning Banner many times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu discovered that, against a fourth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator, his previous physical advantage was indeed significantly diminished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he still had his advantage of the past, he would have been able to easily defeat the White Fiend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, this sort of advantage would lessen further on if his Invincible Vajra Body did not continue to strengthen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And even if he reached the tenth tier of the Jindan Dao Realm, he would still be a far cry from fifth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he still had to give it a try.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No wonder you're so capable. What a stupendous physique. However...." The White Fiend gave a wicked laugh and changed once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Thousand-Eye Demon God!" With a shake of his body, he began to grow, becoming a white demon god. The Thousand-Eye Spirit Beckoning Banner furled around his body, and the thousand eyes on the cloth fused into his body, turning him into a white monster!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This creature had 1,000 eyes on its body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The eyes lit up. Some were alive, while others were gripped in agony and torment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Save me, oh, save me!" The eyes constantly beseeched of Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu shuddered all over. The White Fiend was undoubtedly terrifying in this form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Unshackled Doppelganger!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He immediately split into his doppelgangers. Besides the one that was recovering, there were nine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, the 10 unanimously used Immortal Ape Transformation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">10 golden apes surrounded this thousand-eyed white demon god. The scene was a spectacular one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A violent showdown!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're really an interesting one. I will have you converted to a Corpse Puppet. Your body will definitely be an exquisite treasure!" The White Fiend looked at Wu Yu with a glint in his eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To him, Wu Yu was indeed too precious an object.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That covetous glance was completely focused on Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, hearing the voices from outside, the people on the Yan Huang Warship were even more panicked now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Those eight are completely played out. If Commander Wu loses, then the White Fiend will definitely come for us!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sh*t, and General Commander Huangfu is also caught up, and even being held down by the Black Fiend."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We're doomed! I don't know what they're thinking. Against such a terrifying opponent, why are they not running!?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's all because Wu Yu's showing off! If not for Wu Yu, we wouldn't be in such danger! Wu Yu should die!" Those of the Green Willow Camp could not help but raise such a clamor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What did you say!?" Wu Tianyu was immediately bristling with anger upon hearing this. He rushed over to deliver that person a slap, raging. "Our General Commander is protecting us, and you actually speak such heartless words. See if I don't beat you to death!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You would actually dare to hit someone one from Green Willow Camp!?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Deep Pine Camp brothers, we are being bullied by Heaven's Equal Camp!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Get them!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, the Yan Huang Warship descended into chaos. It was an intense clash, and Heaven's Equal Camp was being flanked by two other camps. They could only take a beating, and Wu Tianyu was also beaten to the ground in the resulting skirmish and took a few blows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Dog, you're asking for it!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What does Heaven's Equal Camp have to be proud about? Wu Yu's capable? He's still going to fall in battle immediately!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as they were fighting, Wu Yu was doing battle with the final form of the White Fiend's Thousand-Eye Demon God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang, bang, bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In their clash, they both employed their own techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ping, ping, ping!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The doppelgangers' Xuan Immortal Spirit Petrifying Sword Technique was rather ineffectual. Wu Yu's clones were torn down by the White Fiend one after another. From the get-go, Wu Yu was indeed being suppressed.</span></p>
