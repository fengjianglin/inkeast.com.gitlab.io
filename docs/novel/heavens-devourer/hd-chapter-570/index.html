 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu could not help but sigh inwardly. In cultivation, guts and perseverance could be trained. Only luck alone was all up to the gods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lady luck was fickle. Sometimes she was kind, and sometimes she wasn't. Even someone as blessed as Wu Yu had his luck falter sometimes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example, now. Even his escaping clones had already found currents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only his true form alone, despite his best efforts, could not find one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And at this moment, Jiang Qijun was chasing his real body. Although Jiang Qijun did not know it, she still dealt with it as she had with the other clones!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was at the Primordial Spirit Transformation Realm, and her dao treasure was wielded superbly! Wu Yu had once seen her unleash a golden bangle which had instantly killed a Water Source Crystal Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the pursuit, her golden bangle flew back and forth, slaughtering Wu Yu's doppelgangers. They could not stand a single hit from the dao treasure!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Die!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that instant, Jiang Qijun's golden robes whirled, her golden eyes flat. Although her aura was elegant and noble, and her features beautiful beyond compare, the power emanating from her made one hesitate to approach, let alone have any stray thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden bangle was again flung out violently from her hand, transforming into a beam of golden light that flew towards Wu Yu. There were still a dozen clones beside him, but she had aimed at Wu Yu's true form!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was still some distance between the two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's luck had truly abandoned him at this time. But he had no choice. He had to go for it! At most, he would directly smash his Taigu Immortal Talisman and leave!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was time to show himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He directly employed the Swift Art, which he had not dared to use before. Naturally, his speed was boosted. He also used one clone to block Jiang Qijun's killing move!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After using the Swift Art, Wu Yu poured all his Violet Kingdom Primordial Energy into it. In a flash, he pulled away from Jiang Qijun's field of vision!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The doppelganger shenanigans were no longer confusing them. Up next was a contest of speed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Jiang Qijun was incensed. She shouted loudly, "Found the real body! Over here!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her words immediately had the rest abandoning the chase of Wu Yu's doppelgangers. They swarmed over, focusing on Wu Yu's real body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A dozen among them were even stronger than Jiang Qijun. They naturally came at terrific speeds, leaving the rest far behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their speed was ferocious, and they employed all kinds of methods to apply bursts of speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they were still flabbergasted by Wu Yu's speed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This person cannot be a fourth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator, right? He's so many tiers away from me, how can he have such speed?!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Impossible! His speed far exceeds that of ordinary Primordial Spirit martial cultivators!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This person must have many secrets hidden. Given his cultivation level, he cannot possibly have endured such a long time within the body of the Fire Source Crystal Beast King."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He is not as weak as we thought. However, since his real body has been exposed, then he won't be able to escape our clutches. So what if he has such speed!?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, as Wu Yu flew at five times his usual speed, even Jiang Qijun was still faster than he was. Let alone the others!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu calculated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"They will catch me within 20 breaths of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If the currents still do not come in that time, I can only return to the Dong Sheng Divine Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"At least getting all these ancient crystals means that I can complete my Unbeatable Dragon King Buddha Body."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if he were chased out, it would still be a good result for Wu Yu! Besides, once he left, Jiang Qijun would definitely have to explain to the others what Wu Yu's words had meant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's already not bad to have made it this far."&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu smiled. Even if he was forced out of the Taigu Immortal Path at this juncture, he would have no regrets. He had not failed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, he was already clutching his Taigu Immortal Talisman, ready to return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These Yan Huang Ancient Country experts were definitely worried that he would make such a choice. That was why they were more anxious than anybody at this time. They were all red in the face, with ugly expressions that showed they wished they could eat Wu Yu whole!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No matter what, although I did not manage to go to Yan Huang Ancient Country this time, I will definitely go there one day!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu did not turn back. He was charging through the sea with all his might. Behind him, many super geniuses were employing their own methods to chase him madly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He made a vow to himself!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wanted to become immortal and to catch up to Luo Pin. In that case, he needed a bigger playing field. Without question, the Yan Huang Ancient Region was the place that he had to go. That place held a fascination for Wu Yu. As long as the threat of the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord was not banished, he could not remain in the Dong Sheng Divine Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Jiang Qijun! At this time, are you still going to hide the secret between us? Stop hiding what you should say! Haha...." At this time, Wu Yu could clearly sense the threat from behind him. There were a few elite beings from the imperial family within their number who had already overtaken Jiang Qijun and were hot on his tail. Within three breaths' time, they would take down Wu Yu and his Sumeru Pouch!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a huge disparity that could not be covered up!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, they had grown up in the Yan Huang Ancient Country, while the Yan Huang Imperial City that Wu Yu thought had been the highest power was but a mere rural city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking in front of him, it was impossible that there were still currents, which was why Wu Yu had given up. His luck could not always be so splendid. He gripped the Taigu Immortal Talisman tightly, ready to smash it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, before he crushed it, he still had to drop some parting shots that would force Jiang Qijun to speak of the matter of the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Taigu Immortal Path! What other secrets do you hold? I hope that I will have the chance in this life to return!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, that was wishful thinking. Because 50 years from now, he would be over 50 years old, and would no longer be qualified to enter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he was not content that things were ending like this, protecting his life was more important in the end, so he had no other choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't leave!" The Yan Huang Ancient Country people also knew that he was about to crush his Taigu Immortal Talisman. They were incredibly anxious!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We won't kill you! As long as you hand over the ancient crystals, we will immediately let you go, and you need not leave the Taigu Immortal Path!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In their panic, they were forced to make such concessions. They would definitely hold to their word in such situations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had not expected that they would go this far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But if he handed over the ancient crystals, such an opportunity would not come by again. He considered his options, and still decided to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This decision was made in a split second.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's choice was definitely beyond their calculations. It made them gnash with frustration! And at this time, they all did not know what Wu Yu was called.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu channeled his Violet Kingdom Primordial Energy into the Taigu Immortal Talisman!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But there were many strange things that happened in this world. Some things would not happen until the very last moment. This, too, was a part of fate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example, now. Whether it was the Yan Huang Ancient Country experts’ chase, or Wu Yu's departure, they were all halted in their tracks! It was as though time had stopped at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu found himself unable to move in this instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, everyone was the same way. Vaguely, everyone could hear a sound of fury and discontent, an agonized lament, familiar in its despair. It was a sound everyone was actually familiar with, because it had been the same sound that the Fire Source Crystal Beast King had cried out in its throes of death. It had made this sound before it had expired.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This signified that the final Spirit of the Universe King, the Water Source Crystal Beast King, had finally succumbed under the combined onslaught of the experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was luckier. Its opponents had not been as united as the Yan Huang Ancient Country fighters had been. This was why it had managed to hold on for longer, becoming the last one to die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This did not count for much. Those over there must have started another huge battle over the Water Source Ancient Crystal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This should not concern Wu Yu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But a miracle happened in this instant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of a sudden!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Water Source Crystal Beast King died, the endless sea finally changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For the longest time, everyone had abided in this endless sea, unable to find a way out. Many were getting anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But they had no choice. This was the Taigu Immortal Path, which did not follow any rules.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And at this time, as the three Kings of the Spirits of the Universe had fallen in battle, the entire sea changed! This change happened just before Wu Yu crushed the Taigu Immortal Talisman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unbelievably, the currents that he had earnestly wished for appeared!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And these currents were not small ones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire sea was awash with the currents. This meant that no one was spared. Even the few Yan Huang Ancient Country imperial geniuses who had been about to kill Wu Yu were swept up in these currents!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were the strongest and most unruly currents seen so far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was immediately rolled up in the mad currents, carried in all directions until the world itself dimmed. As the world spun, everything disappeared. As did the threat!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the currents, Wu Yu was thrown all over. He was dizzy, but also didn't know if he should laugh or cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had already prepared himself to leave the Taigu Immortal Path, but now it seemed like he was pulled back with a new lease of life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This also means that the sea was but a stage. The stage would be broken once the three Kings died. I wonder if this Taigu Immortal Path was originally so, or if it is being controlled by the immortals' design, or if it is all an intricate choreography of spirit designs?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter what the truth was, right now Wu Yu had not only obtained the ancient crystals, but had also escaped danger, at least temporarily. For now, the Yan Huang Ancient Country people could not molest him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because in these currents, they were already lost to the waves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was being thrown all over as well, limbs akimbo. He did not even know what was ahead of him anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Where will I end up after these currents subside? Where will everyone end up?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"A place besides the stars and sea? Or will I be returned to the sea? Or back to the stars?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was filled with anticipation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an unexpected return from danger!</span></p>
