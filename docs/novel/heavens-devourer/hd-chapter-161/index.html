 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Si Fangji and Qi Yunji had died. The widely notorious Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts had turned into the Scarlet Sea's Four Ghosts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All that was left were Tian Yijun, Shen Erjun, Yu Sanji, and Wu Shengjun. In fact, all of them were wearing mantles, so it was impossible to discern their facial expressions by looking. However, it wouldn't be too far fetched to say that they were all absolutely fuming within!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three of their fellow brothers and sisters, including their disciple, the Spectral Concubine, had been murdered by Wu Yu. Frankly speaking, they were afraid that even after they had conquered the Bipo Mountain Range and obtained what they wanted, what would be left was their corpses littering the fields and their losses unsustainable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, their losses were even greater than that of Jiang Xie!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Conversely, the demons seemed to have had no losses thus far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was most important was that they had been completely led by the nose by a single young cultivator of the previous generation. With their lofty status and their fearful might, this was an unacceptable humiliation!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire Bipo Mountain Range could hear the exhortations of the Scarlet Sea's Four Ghosts. Everyone was able to see that a large area was filled with ghostly qi. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After killing Si Fangji, Wu Yu had immediately gone into hiding. This last assassination attempt had left him jumpy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I have finally managed to kill someone at the ninth tier Qi Condensation Realm. However, what follows will definitely not be easy. It was only with Master's help that she was suppressed and I was not forced into a protracted battle."&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's heart was clear that this victory was not purely due to him. He had received the assistance of Feng Xueya and the rest. They had cleared the way for his dao, they had hidden him, and they had also helped to distract the opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, even though he had heard numerous cheers and the support of his fellow disciples, as well as seen the gazes that were burning with excitement, Wu Yu was similarly jubilant, but he did not relax. He knew that the beginning of this task would be easy and the true struggle had only just started!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He still had to kill four more demons and one ghostly cultivator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts have lost three individuals but have not given up yet!"</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wu Yu saw that the three tenth tier Qi Condensation ghostly cultivators had surrounded Wu Shengjun. Despite this, their positions left a gap. It was as though they were attempting to entice Wu Yu to attack. If Wu Yu were to attempt another assault, there was a chance he might not escape and there was a chance that he could! It was a risky position to attack from, but there was the possibility of success.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, on the Ninth Spirit's side, they had also arranged themselves in a formation. It was clear that their party was more relaxed. The Ninth Spirit moved as she pleased, and it was obvious that it would be a lot easier to strike a blow towards the demons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The other party has the Ninth Spirit protecting them. Although it looks like an easier opportunity, it’s countless times more scary! If I want to drive them out of the 10,000 Swords Formation, I have to start with killing Wu Shengjun!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps the Scarlet Sea's Four Ghosts felt that with their tight, protective formation, Wu Yu might feel more inclined towards launching his assault onto the demons. Yet that was not the case. Under the protection of the 10,000 Swords Formation, he hid in the vicinity of the Scarlet Sea's Four Ghosts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In just a blink, it was as though the world was blanketed in silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was keeping their eyes peeled in trepidation as they awaited any changes in the 10,000 Swords Formation. If Wu Yu succeeded, the three way alliance's strength would gradually diminish. Furthermore, the Heavenly Sword Sect would still be able to maintain control of the 10,000 Swords Formation. However, if Wu Yu made a mistake, Jiang Xie would be able to utilize Wu Yu in a trade when he fell into the hands of the enemy and receive concessions in this war.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was clear that a single Wu Yu's worth exceeded that of a thousand Zhongyuan Dao Sect disciples!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We cannot retreat. Even if Jiang Xie does not assist them, they still plan to destroy this 10,000 Swords Formation. Even if my life is wasted to prevent them from advancing, I can only fall here!"</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;These were the true thoughts within Wu Yu's mind. It was his unwavering faith and belief.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if his belief was like a raging inferno, he had to act like a starving wolf, silently stalking within the woods! He had to be patient and await the most decisive moment to deliver the crucial blow!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His sole target was the one protected by the three ghostly cultivators at the 10th tier of the Qi Condensation Realm, Wu Shengjun!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immediately after that last altercation, everyone's heartstrings had been stretched taut in fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, time flowed by minute after minute with no further development. Like this, an hour passed. Everyone started to become impatient. Just why had this Wu Yu not struck yet? Just what was he waiting for? Could it be that he had stealthily left the 10,000 Swords Formation and returned back to the Heavenly Sword Sect?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya and the rest had used the formation to veil Wu Yu's position. It was entirely possible that Wu Yu had crept away under the cover of this large, mountain forest!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ones who were fidgeting the most were the Scarlet Sea's Four Ghosts. They were hoping to bait Wu Yu into attacking them. To them, it was as though the fish that was Wu Yu had slinked away in front of their very eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Shall we compete to see who is more patient?" Tian Yijun gave a cold harrumph. He warned everyone to maintain their state of alertness. Even blinking was not acceptable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a battle of the hunter against the hunted. Wu Shengjun was the bait and Wu Yu was the prey!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time continued to tick. This heartstopping atmosphere had lasted until the dawn of the next day. Yet everyone still stayed calm and reserved despite Wu Yu not making any movements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A day had passed. 12 two-hour periods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It seems possible that Wu Yu has already fled!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There is no movement whatsoever. How could this be?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Could he have just tricked us to stay put while he went to seek reinforcements?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's very likely he did just that!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three tenth tier Qi Condensation individuals of the Scarlet Sea's Four Ghosts began to discuss the possibilities of what had happened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During this period of time, Tian Yijun had beseeched Jiang Xie to return and catch Wu Yu. However, the moment Jiang Xie even so much as stepped into the formation, Night Wishes for Snow and the disciples with him would react. Without a second word, they had executed 10 disciples. Jiang Xie had only stepped into the formation for a breath's worth of time and 10 of his disciples had died. If he remained, they would kill till none were left!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Jiang Xie's fury rose to the heavens. However, all he could do was slink back out of the formation, defeated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The clouds above roiled as the trees on the ground rustled in the wind, the leaves dancing amidst the breeze. All three parties began to bicker as time passed, and the atmosphere gradually became noisier.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I feel that we have been taken for a ride by that Wu Yu! It has already been three days. Who knows where Wu Yu might have run to?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Lets just attack the 10,000 Swords Formation. No more time shall be wasted!" a demon exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Are the Zhongyuan Dao Sect's disciples still there?" someone asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There are about a thousand odd disciples who are at the third tier of Qi Condensation Realm. Just let them go. The Bipo Mountain Range is a heavenly treasure. What do these disciples count for? So long as the Zhongyuan Dao Sect succeeds, such disciples can be easily raised." In a blink, the many parties within the 10,000 Swords Formation began to bicker.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was true that the invaders were supposed to have broken past the 10,000 Swords Formation a few months back. They should have conquered the Bipo Mountain Range by now. However, many months later, they had not even managed to even touch a single Heavenly Sword Sect cultivator. Regardless of their motives, all of them were deeply unsatisfied with the current situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Today's deadlock had all been due to Wu Yu throwing himself into the mix!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, all they could do was find a way out of the 10,000 Swords Formation under the threat of Wu Yu's attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unknowingly, eight days had already passed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These days had truly driven all of those involved crazy. In their eyes, Wu Yu had clearly left the 10,000 Swords Formation much earlier and had fooled the Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, Wu Shengjun could no longer hold it back. In these eight days, he had been consistently vigilant and on the look out for trouble. Anyone would go crazy. Angrily, he exclaimed, "Big Brother, let’s ignore this Wu Yu. Let us regroup with the demons and break through this formation. Eliminating the Heavenly Sword Sect is just a matter of time!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tian Yijun frowned. "It's not as easy as it seems. Jiang Xie is one of our major pillars of strength and yet he has been restrained. Without him, it will be very difficult to assault this place. The Heavenly Sword Sect is not an herbivore."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We have to use Wu Yu to trade for the lives of Jiang Xie's disciples?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Indeed. This is the only solution."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was truly an infuriating moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What they sought was to conquer the Heavenly Sword Sect with the smallest amount of casualties. Although the Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts had already suffered grievous losses, the demons had not. The Ninth Spirit could tell that the Heavenly Sword Sect was unwilling to struggle with them now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tian Yijun and the Ninth Spirit began to converse. The Ninth Spirit only spoke one sentence. “Do not attack, we must capture Wu Yu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The task of capturing Wu Yu was even more important to the Ninth Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the moment while Wu Shengjun and Tian Yijun had finished speaking, they could feel a creeping feeling in their hearts. The 10,000 Swords Formation warped!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been a full eight days!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After staying still for eight days, Wu Yu had finally found his best opportunity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was as though he was a starving wolf, striking only when the prey had relaxed! It was clear that he had spent the entire time hiding within the sword qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Shengjun was still speaking angrily when he felt the sword qi beside him agitate. The killing intent of the entire formation seemed to have gathered right beside him, rushing at him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Save me!" Wu Shengjun was screaming in fear! &nbsp;Frankly speaking, he was truly quite shocked. His opponent had been patient enough to wait for a full eight days, and this attack truly struck him when he least expected it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his eyes, Wu Yu had become an absolutely terrifying existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was not only in terms of his strength and nature, but also his patience!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was up in arms. Within the formation, a golden shadow materialized in front of Wu Shengjun's eyes. While Wu Shengjun defended against the sword qi, Wu Yu had already made his move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had already transformed into a golden immortal ape!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blazing, golden eyes and giant, muscular body, ferocious expression and savage instinct led all that saw him to feel a deep-rooted sense of fear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was truly odd was that despite being a sword cultivator, he was not wielding his Onyx &amp; Pearl Dao Swords but rather his Demon Subduing Staff!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Nine Dragons Ascension Column, When Nine Become One!" Drawing upon the strength of his fleshly body, the Inner Vajra Buddha provided gigantic strength. All of it was perfectly imbued into this attack, a single explosive blow!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu grunted as the entire mountain forest shook. The four-zhang-tall Inner Vajra Buddha could be seen emanating from his body, its boundless might bearing its full force to suppress Wu Shengjun.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nine dragons coiled around the Demon Subduing Staff as though they had truly become part of the body of the weapon. When Nine Become One, a giant dragon god rushed outwards!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point in time, Wu Shengjun was feeling quite worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had lost control of himself before a cultivator. This was the most terrifying thing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Especially since all of his spirit had already been crushed by the surrounding sword qi. When Wu Yu appeared, the blow landed squarely upon his forehead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kacha!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His skull was smashed into pieces and his organs disintegrated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, his body was devastated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet at this moment in time, the three remaining ghostly cultivators had seen Wu Yu and immediately pounced. At such a short distance, it would be easy to catch him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the opportunity they had been waiting for.</span></p>
