 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sword Sect was already prepared to fight to the death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Through these arrangements, the unaffiliated servants were already gathered near the Valley of Immortal Fate. Once the 10,000 Swords Formation was broken, they could scatter and run towards the Sky Region Forest, hiding separately. The Sky Region Forest was huge, and they had some martial capabilities. A majority should be able to live.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few external disciples who were unwilling to die here had also been granted their freedom by Feng Xueya. He allowed them to mingle with the servants. If the 10,000 Swords Formation broke, Feng Xueya would hold the enemies back and they would not be able to reach the Valley of Immortal Fate that quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A majority of the core disciples and above vowed to live and die with the Heavenly Sword Sect. They were all congregated at the Stone Gate of a Thousand Swords. There were over a thousand disciples here. This group included all the core disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect, and were led by Wu Yu, Night Wishes for Snow, Lan Boli, and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Ding and Qinghua of the East were being forced to kneel before everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Today, the Heavenly Sword Sect was silent as a tomb. Everyone was watching the elders and the Sect Leader on the stone swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The will of the Heavenly Sword Sect was anchored by Feng Xueya. All these years, virtually all the disciples had been influenced by him. The sword dao was without enemies. No fear in their hearts!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They would die without regrets for the swords in their hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The gloom that had plagued them in these days had given way to the rising passion of the disciples as the fateful battle loomed before them. The immortal treasures in their hands were pointed in the direction of the enemy, at the Stone Gate of a Thousand Swords. Light gleamed off their swords, and their will soared!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"To have the honor of standing with all of you here against our enemies is an unforgettable memory I will cherish all my life!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beside Wu Yu was Su Yanli, as was Mo Shishu and Qing Mang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Mang had not yet managed to condense qi, but she had not backed away, boldly coming to stand here. She too hefted a sword, preparing to draw blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps because everyone was young, and had never been in such a situation before, fear clouded their hearts. After all, many had never even met a real demon before. But many more were fearless, buoyed by their faith! Wu Yu looked at every face. They were young and frail but had the courage to stand here. They would not be conquered!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In life, they were the people of the Heavenly Sword Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In death, they would be the spirits of the Heavenly Sword Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Wu Yu was not pessimistic, he could already see the endless rivers of blood before him. Even though the battle had yet to commence, he could see every young face before him flat on the ground, their faces pale and their eyes dim. They would vanish alongside their young dreams.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Qing Mang, Senior Sister...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, he saw the young Qing Mang dead at his feet. He stared fearfully at her. Behind her were ghostly cultivators and demons....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He saw Su Yanli crumpled in his arms, her eyes forever closed as she wasted away into bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He saw every familiar face litter the plain as a corpse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the people who had lent Wu Yu Spirit Concentration Pills - Wu Yu was unable to pay back the debt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu suddenly came to his senses. Everyone was still around him. It was just a cruel figment of his imagination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it was what he wished to see the least.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Junior Brother, what's the matter?" Su Yanli had not smiled for a long time, and her eyes were hollow as well. She had not seen the same rocket-like improvement that Wu Yu had, and perhaps was feeling even more anxious at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking of the first time they met, she was beautiful like a goddess. Riding her Immortal Crane, she had led Wu Yu to the path of dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She thought of that time he was sealed, when Wu Yu had vowed to become her junior brother. She had smiled, and believed him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"They're coming in!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the 10,000 Swords Formation shook.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu lifted his head to look. Feng Xueya and the others looked more grim than ever before. The nine mighty warriors stood on the stone swords, fighting together to control the 10,000 Swords Formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the looks on their faces, it was clear that the enemy's attack today was different than before!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The 10,000 Swords Formation shuddered strongly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each shake was a test to the 1,000 disciples. Stay? Or leave? But happily, the hatred in their eyes only intensified. No one wanted to leave! Or perhaps, some had waited for this battle to the death for too long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time lapsed by!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's eyes were open wide as he watched Feng Xueya and the others use their vast reserves of spiritual power to hold out the attack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the 10,000 Swords Formation, sword qi flew everywhere, rolling over everything like a tsunami!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, their expressions changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">First, the Disorienting Mist Formation was broken. In an instant, the rolling mist that had cloaked the Bipo Mountain Range for all these days vanished. The intense sun beat down, illuminating all that it touched. The mountains and rivers sparkled even more brilliantly under the bright rays.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Bipo Mountain Range had returned to its former self.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But this was not a good thing! It was even more dangerous!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu and the others could clearly see that the 10,000 Swords Formation had lost its cover. The swords gleamed as they flew on, slicing into a crowd of people ahead. It was Jiang Xie, the Ninth Spirit, and the others. About 20 of them were thronging around an emaciated elder, who was the Dark Entropic Lord of the East Sea. They were protecting him while he took down the 10,000 Swords Formation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Feng Xueya, save your strength. Your 10,000 Swords Formation cannot hold out for more than a few days. If I were you, I would get down on my knees and beg for life. Perhaps you might still live."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Xie and the others could clearly see Feng Xueya's position. All had become clear now, and he laughed loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From where they stood, they could see demons from all sides, forming a huge mass that stared malevolently at them. Demonic aura overwhelmed them and fanned the flames of anxiety in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The disciples of the Zhongyuan Dao Sect were smiling coldly as well, preparing to begin the slaughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ping, ping, ping!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even more sword qi barraged them, holding Jiang Xie and the others back with a wave of attacks and preventing them from advancing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Dark Entropic Lord was an expert in this aspect. Clearly, he was looking for the key spot in the 10,000 Swords Formation. Wu Yu did not understand what was happening, but he knew that if this continued, the 10,000 Swords Formation would fall in a few days. At that time, it would mean the doom of the Heavenly Sword Sect. For a battle of this scale, even if they did not lose, many amongst them would surely die!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A challenge between sects was a savage affair!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What should I do?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this fight of Immortal Dao, what could he alone achieve?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu raged internally. He wanted to kill them all, but was far from Jiang Xie's level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And if he was not at that level, then he could not turn the tide. All his companions were doomed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was racking his brains. The only thing that he could do was use the Art of Sword Flight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What can I do with the Art of Sword Flight?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could not see Su Yanli and the others swept up into the battle. He panicked. He wanted to change it all. Otherwise, how could he repay Feng Xueya for all the times he had saved his life?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"An Immortal Dao battle is just like a mortal battle, only with more power...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had been leading troops into battle since young, and had a natural grasp of battlefield tactics.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If they turn out in full strength, then that means their home base is weak. I wonder how many pros were left behind at the Zhongyuan Immortal Mountain."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking thus, Wu Yu sprung into action. He quietly asked Feng Xueya, "Master, how many mighty warriors are left at the Zhongyuan Immortal Mountain?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed like a majority of the Zhongyuan Dao Sect members that were third tier of the Qi Condensation Realm and above had turned up. There must’ve been hundreds more that remained back at the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There's one of the ninth tier qi condensation cultivator, and two of the ninth tier qi condensation cultivator."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had hollowed out the core strength of the Zhongyuan Dao Sect. Even Feng Xueya aside, Lan Huayi and the others were still very strong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu understood now. Jiang Xie had it in for Feng Xueya and the nine who were pinned down controlling the 10,000 Swords Formation and unable to leave. He was completely unworried about the Zhongyuan Immortal Mountain. After all, the Heavenly Sword Sect was completely bereft of anyone at the ninth tier of the Qi Condensation Realm and above who could cause trouble to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One ninth tier Qi Condensation elder was enough for defense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It should be Jiang Xie's third brother, Jiang Ji."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Xie and his two brothers. One was in the Jindan Dao Realm, the other at the tenth tier of the Qi Condensation Realm. One more at the ninth tier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya naturally knew all the experts of the Zhongyuan Dao Sect. Eliminating those who were occupied at the 10,000 Swords Formation, only Jiang Ji was left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, what do you have in mind?" Feng Xueya recalled that Wu Yu had been a general in the mortal realm as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu said, "The opponent has committed with all they have to surround and attack us, as if the Bipo Mountain Range were a city. And now, with the moat's demise imminent, our only chance is to send out some special forces to directly target the opponent's base camp. Force them to have to redirect forces back to save their headquarters before the moat falls!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"A pity that they have Jiang Ji standing guard at the headquarters. We of the Heavenly Sword Sect have no such special force to speak of," Feng Xueya said, looking at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We do!" Wu Yu stood up, his eyes blazing. He shouted it, his pride barely tempered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya stared at him unflinchingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I, Wu Yu!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he had expected, Wu Yu pointed a finger at himself. A conflagration burned behind his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya shook his head. "No way. You are not Jiang Ji's match."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had considered this before as well. But after all, Wu Yu was his disciple, and he could not possibly ask Wu Yu to shoulder such a dangerous and important mission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But unexpectedly, Wu Yu refused to back down. He said, "Master, I can use the Art of Sword Flight. That Jiang Ji might be powerful, but I will not face him head-on. I will run around and wreak havoc. Jiang Ji cannot do anything to me!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was possibly the first time that he had rebelled against Feng Xueya's will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With everyone watching, Wu Yu spoke slowly and clearly. "Master, even if you oppose me this time, I have made up my mind. Please await my good news."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was right. But sending him to face Jiang Ji alone was still a risky affair. The odds of dying or losing a fight were still fairly high. He was taking a big risk. Even with the Art of Sword Flight, it did not mean that Jiang Ji would be helpless against him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Junior Brother, I will go with you." Night Wishes for Snow stood up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Wu Yu shook his head. "Let me go alone. Alone, I am more agile. Don't worry, I promise not to clash directly with Jiang Ji."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night Wishes for Snow had no answer to this either. Wu Yu's words made sense. His greatest advantage was his agility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya stared at him, considering silently at length.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Remember. Before this old life fades, you are not allowed to die. Otherwise, your master will find it difficult to forgive you!" Feng Xueya's eyes were turning red at the rims.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Master, I don't die easy!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu turned to face everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Everyone, if I don't return with enough Spirit Concentration Pills for everyone, then I won't return at all. The day we meet again, I hope that everyone is still well!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His stirring speech finished, he hurled down the Onyx &amp; Pearl Dao Sword. Stepping on it, he flew into the skies, headed for the Valley of Immortal Fate!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, he could not let Jiang Xie and the others spot his movements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More than a thousand disciples watched him fly off jauntily. On this day, the man on the sword would forever live on in their memory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We sword cultivators fight with faith! We die with no regrets!"</span></p>
