 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-ff8b5bfc-7fff-f292-c8ac-c7c16686fb11"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline"><br></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ba She was now glaring restlessly at the sagely Duomingshan Shengxue. Even though their cultivation levels were about the same, one of them knew how to strategize, while the other was fierce yet possessed low sentience. Obviously the Eighth Hell Emperor, Duomingshan Shengxue, looked to have the higher chance of victory!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The key was that even if Ba She was simply contained, there were two other Ghostly Sages on the ghostly cultivators' side. These two Ghostly Sages were stronger than Wu Yu, Jiu Ying, and the Three Fields Ghostly Sage added together. This way, Wu Yu's chances of victory were very low!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides, Ba She was restless and difficult to control. This was a huge disadvantage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, this was the reason why Yu Fuyao of the Heavenly Seas could snigger at them coldly. She had fought Wu Yu many times, and to her, while Wu Yu could suppress her in terms of ability, she was generally able to turn over and suppress Wu Yu instead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, she had been caught off guard by the appearance of Ba She, but, luckily, her father had not left. It was just that he was coincidentally not at Emperor Yan's Hall during this period of time. If not, it would’ve been difficult for Wu Yu to even think of entering the Calm Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Faced with Duomingshan Shengxue, Ba She only froze for a second before letting out an ear-piercing, sharp hiss. His huge body rolled in the Calm Sea and his frightening power caused the calm sea water to roll out in waves. The waters loosened into the usual ebb and flow of the great sea. The sea water under Wu Yu returned to its original state. Because Ba She was turning and rolling here, even the Godly Sea Steadying Needle that was deep down below vibrated. Its vibration also signalled the loosening of the Calm Sea, the reason these strong waves were born!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The whole Calm Sea was experiencing turbulent currents as though there was a storm born under the sea!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the prelude to Ba She's attack! He was very restless now because he had met an opponent that he had to be careful of. After Ba She disturbed the Calm Sea, Wu Yu could see grand jade-green flames below, erupting towards the sky. In an instant, they covered the sky, and the battle between Ba She and Duomingshan Shengxue immediately started!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In these jade-green flames, they heard the steady clear voice of Duomingshan Shengxue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The two of you, capture Wu Yu and Jiu Ying. I'll handle Ba She. If you succeed, you will be granted great merits."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These words were for the two Ghostly Sages. These two Ghostly Sages were beneath Ba She's body and were shaken by the violent sea waves when they suddenly heard these words. But they were instantly very excited! They had thought that they would die. Now that they had a chance to live and still earn great merits, unlike to the Supreme Twilight Ghostly Sage, who had been swallowed and killed by Ba She, they were all too lucky! Neither of them said another word and locked onto Wu Yu first!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that the Calm Sea was being destroyed and the Godly Sea Steadying Needle was loosening, this place was no different from the usual great sea. They were not far from Wu Yu and should be able to catch him easily!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Let's do it!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In an instant, every party was making their move! The most terrifying was the battle between a restless Ba She and Duomingshan Shengxue. Then it was the two Ghostly Sages grabbing the chance to capture Wu Yu and Jiu Ying. Of them, the female Ghostly Sage, locked onto Jiu Ying. Jiu Ying was beside Ba She and was being protected by the Three Fields Ghostly Sage. There was a certain risk to capturing Jiu Ying. After all, one would have to defend against the attacks of a restless Ba She. However, in the current situation, the beastly Ba She was totally engrossed with Duomingshan Shengxue and seemed to have forgotten these two other Ghostly Sages!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other Ghostly Sage was going to capture Wu Yu. It was much easier. Such an easy way to earn great merits, he almost could not keep his laughter in!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, at this chaotic moment, Wu Yu's movement shocked him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beneath him, Wu Yu instantly transformed into 1,000 doppelgangers!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These 1,000 doppelgangers spread out and ran through the deep sea in all directions and ran towards the Godly Sea Steadying Needle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each doppelganger looked to be a Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator. In this chaotic sea, and with Ba She's jade-green flames shooting everywhere, it was extremely difficult to spot the real Wu Yu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if all of them stood obediently before him, he could not identify the real one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">1,000 doppelgangers were simply too much!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was instantly stunned and rushed to catch a few of them. However, he was not only hit by strong retaliation, but even if he destroyed a few doppelgangers, he could only watch as they disappeared instantly. And there were still 1,000 of them getting closer to the Godly Sea Steadying Needle. Under such circumstances, it was unrealistic to block Wu Yu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ghostly Sage was stunned and panicked. He could only give up on chasing Wu Yu at this moment. He turned and joined forces with that female Ghostly Sage to surround and attack Jiu Ying! At this moment, the Three Fields Ghostly Sage had already been slain by that female Ghostly Sage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Wu Yu was closing in on the Godly Sea Steadying Needle! In his field of vision, the Godly Sea Steadying Needle looked to be over 100 zhang tall and was extremely thick. It was like a pillar that reached the sky! And he was still some distance away from it. The closer he got, the more he realized that the true length of this needle was over 200 zhang! If this was on land, it probably could reach the clouds!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now the sea waves were violent. This Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean that steadied the East Sea Swirls was also vibrating in the sea waves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This dao treasure may be suitable for me! Of course, based on my current ability, it is too difficult to have this Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean to recognize me as its owner! But I just need to loosen it! And not to control it!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This crystal blue pillar had a realistic, blue mystical dragon curled on it. Especially the dragon’s eyes - they were practically identical to Luo Pin's eyes, which Wu Yu had seen. It seemed to possess a type of Immortal Dao aura! This dao treasure looked really fancy, much fancier than the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff. In the Dong Sheng Divine Continent, dao treasures were priceless treasures themselves!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Mystical dragon!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the mystical dragon, Wu Yu felt that it looked friendly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He recalled that the current immortal treasure spirit of this Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean was the mystical dragon that was killed by the First Hell Emperor. That First Hell Emperor was indeed terrifying to be able to slay a mystical dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps this was the reason this immortal treasure spirit was trapped within this dao treasure! When Wu Yu reached it, the immortal treasure spirit was struggling too! Wu Yu saw the eyes of this mystical dragon carving lighting up. It was like a life that was waiting for Wu Yu's help. It was now that Wu Yu realized that it was not Ba She that was causing the vibrations of the Godly Sea Steadying Needle, it was this Godly Sea Steadying Needle that had sensed Wu Yu's intentions and was struggling too!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could see that there were many spirit designs covering the Godly Sea Steadying Needle. It was due to these spirit designs that the Godly Sea Steadying Needle was frozen here. Now it was violently struggling, causing the angry sea waves. The spirit designs on it were also violently churning. They were probably loosening too, but these were the spirit designs that the Eighth Hell Emperor had put in place and could probably lock it down here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Wu Yu's 1,000 doppelgangers surrounded it. Soundlessly, he seemed to have heard the call of the Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean, calling for Wu Yu to help it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a pleasant surprise for Wu Yu. He had not expected this Godly Sea Steadying Needle to be defiant against Emperor Yan's Hall. With the addition of the new immortal treasure spirit, it was probably even more defiant. Perhaps for so many years, it had long lost its patience being trapped in the territory of ghostly cultivators!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Let's do it!" Wu Yu did not say anything more. His 1,000 doppelgangers used the Nine Suns Black Dragon Sword formation at the same time. Instantly, countless rays of sword qi hit the Godly Sea Steadying Needle. The first to suffer the attacks were the spirit designs on it. Wu Yu's sword qi was a fierce clashing attack and was effective at destroying spirit designs! &nbsp;Wu Yu's valiant efforts were only just a fraction of what the Godly Sea Steadying Needle was doing to set itself free!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And his real body was also prepared to release a strong strike to facilitate this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could not use Purgatory Chains on these spirit designs, so Wu Yu was prepared to destroy it using the Violent Art!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, explosive cracking sounds came from the Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean. It was all caused by Wu Yu's attacks! Each attack from Wu Yu caused the East Sea Swirls to become chaotic. The whole Emperor Yan's Hall would then tremble once. Unknowingly, the violent East Sea Swirls were already prepared to tear everything apart!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Emperor Yan's Hall, the ghostly cultivators who experienced these tremors were all nervous. Every one of them was wailing in panic. They did not think that the return of the Eighth Hell Emperor would not resolve the danger entirely and for things to progress to such a dangerous stage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, stop!" the ghostly cultivators warned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Above Wu Yu's head, Ba She was covering the Calm Sea. He was not allowing Duomingshan Shengxue to attack and enter. The attacks of these two Primordial Spirit Transformation Realm cultivators made the loudest scene. Many ghostly cultivators were dead because they had been caught in the aftershocks of their attacks!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Anyway, to Wu Yu, the battle he had waged himself was of even greater importance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All his attention was now on attacking crazily. To him, as long as he loosened this Godly Sea Steadying Needle, he would have achieved the final victory! The violent East Sea Swirls would tear this place apart, and at that moment, everyone would be swept away. He had the Invincible Vajra Body and was not worried at all that he would be torn apart by the East Sea Swirls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He seemed to have heard a hint of Yu Fuyao of the Heavenly Seas's high-pitched warning screams. She was probably so scared that her face had turned green. But Wu Yu ignored her totally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, stop now! If you do not stop, then Jiu Ying will die before you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, one of the Ghostly Sages threatened him. Wu Yu looked over only then. The Three Fields Ghostly Sage had already been killed and Jiu Ying had nowhere to hide. At this moment, he under the control of the female Ghostly Sage. The female Ghostly Sage was holding onto pitch black ropes that were binding Jiu Ying's demonic body. The ropes were like blades that were embedded deeply into Jiu Ying's body, and there were many blood streaks on him. At this moment, Jiu Ying was suppressed and covered in blood!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was in danger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ba She seemed to have been provoked by Duomingshan Shengxue, so at this moment, he did not care about protecting Jiu Ying. And the Eighth Hell Emperor was even pinning Ba She down tightly to prevent him from noticing Jiu Ying's state!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the female Ghostly Sage spoke, the rope continued to tighten. Jiu Ying was in a precarious situation. Under such circumstances, Wu Yu stopped immediately. He could not watch Jiu Ying be killed in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Very good. If you don't want Jiu Ying to die, come up and disarm yourself." The other Ghostly Sage sneered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu frowned and glared at them. Of course, he was not willing to listen to their orders, but Jiu Ying was his brother. No matter how important this matter was, he could not let Jiu Ying die!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright! Don't mess around." Wu Yu gritted his teeth and his eyes were blood-shot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying's nine heads moved, his scarlet eyes fixated on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He said, "You are overestimating them. They can't kill me!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Shut up!" the female Ghostly Sage chided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying laughed and said, "You guys look down on Ba She! How could the the Eighth Hell Emperor trap him!?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was very bold. Even though he was in such a dangerous situation and covered in blood, he kept laughing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu made eye contact with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, whether to believe him or not had become the most difficult choice for Wu Yu!</span></p>
