 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Spectral Concubine." The bloody scene immediately got Wu Yu's blood boiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Chronicles of the Dong Sheng Divine Continent&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">notes that ghostly cultivators are extremely cruel, even using the blood, flesh, bones, and souls of mortals as ingredients for cultivation. Atrocities. I did not believe it at first!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Presently, the Spectral Concubine was before him. She had killed this infant's parents and grandparents, and then was about to cultivate using the child's pristine body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wicked beyond redemption!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment Wu Yu saw her, he had moved to pull out the Demon Subduing Staff. He was better in close combat. At such a close distance, the Demon Subduing Staff produced tens of thousands of kilograms of mystical force, smashing into the Spectral Concubine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spectral Concubine was cloaked in a black cape. When Wu Yu attacked without a word, her face froze in a cold expression. She shielded herself with that black cape, and Wu Yu felt like the Demon Subduing Staff had been plunged into water, completely unable to harm the opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Spectral Concubine seemed to become one with the black cape. She easily shrugged off Wu Yu's strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, as a result, they had exchanged places. Wu Yu was now at the bedhead. Without a word, the Demon Subduing Staff cracked down, smashing the wooden bed as well as the blood diagram. The infant flew into the air and was swept into Wu Yu's arms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu could not save the other adults, but at least he could ensure that this child survived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sun Wudao, you dare to ruin my good work?" Spectral Concubine stood at the door, glowering malevolently at Wu Yu. Her face was as white as a sheet of paper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Despicable ghostly cultivator, you commit such atrocities in my Capital Wu, and you still dare to act righteous!?" A deep lust to kill was rising in Wu Yu's heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing Wu Yu say thus, the Spectral Concubine actually screeched with laughter. She sized Wu Yu up from head to toe and then said, "I had thought you of more years. Who would have thought you were just a kid who had barely seen the world? You reek of a sense of righteousness. How laughable. A person like you would not last more than a month if you leave your sect. The Zhongyuan Dao Sect's Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian understands how the world works. While you live, you should learn from him."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she said this, she gave two high cackles and turned to leave as though nothing had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If you harm the citizens of my Capital Wu, forget about leaving so easily!" Wu Yu had not thought she would be this brazen. He knew that she was savage, and he was afraid that she would not let them stay at Capital Wu easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sun Wudao, I know the agreement that your Heavenly Sword Sect has with the Zhongyuan Dao Sect. But now we must be clear: the one who rules here is not you, but Hao Tian. You had best keep your nose out of our business. I'm not afraid of your Heavenly Sword Sect. If you cross me, I'll butcher you and turn you into a blood pill for a snack." Spectral Concubine whipped back, her gaze already filled with strong killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was definitely a devilish one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was not the impetuous type. He had assessed whether he should attack. From a logical perspective, this was not the time to settle things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You've ruined all the fun. What a bother!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Spectral Concubine whirled her cape and transformed into a black shadow. She rapidly vanished into the black night of Capital Wu. She was headed for the direction of the palace, and was probably returning back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had originally wanted to pursue, but it was incredibly inconvenient with a bawling infant in his arms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I have to get Hao Tian to control her. I definitely cannot allow her to run rampant in Capital Wu."</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wu Yu knew that it was the only way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But beneath his feet was carnage....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fresh blood covered the floor. Four corpses, their eyes still staring lifelessly. And a baby bawling at the top of its lungs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Child, I will definitely take revenge for you in the future...."&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu gritted his teeth and delivered the child to Carefree Palace. He roused Wu You and told her all that had happened. From now on, there would definitely be somebody at Carefree Palace who would take care of the child.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who would have thought that this Spectral Concubine was so perversely sick. Wu Yu, what do you intend to do...." Wu You hugged the crying infant, her face flustered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I will go and look for Hao Tian. She must be stopped!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian was the one who Wu Yu wanted to kill the most. But under such circumstances, he could only choose to conceal his true intention. If he could defeat the Spectral Concubine and save Wu You, the next one to go down would definitely be Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was almost dawn. In the remaining grey of night left, Wu Yu traversed through the streets of Capital Wu and entered the palace. He roughly knew where Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian was housed. As he neared the vicinity, he shouted for him by name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sun Wudao, what is the matter?" Hao Tian was obviously displeased with Wu Yu barging into the palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu directly recounted all that had happened that night, and then sternly said, "Hao Tian, I can overlook that you remain at Capital Wu. I can turn a blind eye to many things, but the disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect shoulder the heavy burden of slaying demons. While I am in Capital Wu, I will not let the Spectral Concubine continue to harm people with impunity!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian's expression turned chilly after he had finished listening, and he said, "Old Brother Sun, listen to me. The Spectral Concubine is a disciple of the East Sea's Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts. They are very powerful within the East Sea. I suggest you look out for your own survival and avoid clashing with her over a few mortals. After all, this world is vast. There are mortals in abundance, and it's not like a few dying will make them go extinct!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it was not for the fact that he already knew how rotten Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian was, he would definitely keel over in anger upon hearing those words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, the lives of mortals were no different than ants to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu knew that he would speak thus. If he could count on this person to stop Spectral Concubine on the account of the populace's lives, then the sun would probably rise from the west.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu already had a plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Spectral Concubine had called him a greenhorn, then he would affect the manner of one. "Hao Tian, I can tolerate many things, but to let a demonic ghostly cultivator run rampant throughout Capital Wu is not one of them! If you do not intervene, then I can only tell the sect that a ghostly cultivator that I cannot deal with has appeared in Capital Wu and ask them to come. They can kill Spectral Concubine a hundred times over in the month that she is at Capital Wu!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, these were all just scare tactics.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Capital Wu was Wu Yu's own test. Unless he was on the verge of death, he would not ask others from the sect for help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, this left Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian with no way out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was manageable if Wu Yu was clever. But he was afraid that Wu Yu would touch a nerve. Who would have thought that it would be exactly as he feared? Wu Yu had touched the nerve. To him, that was difficult to deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright, I'll go with you to discuss this with the Spectral Concubine," Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian spat. With a flourish of his sleeves, he strode towards East Sun Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Keh." Wu Yu smirked to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sun Wudao, I warn you that this laughable righteousness of yours will be the end of you sooner or later. We martial cultivators are dedicated to the dao. If you cannot look past mortal death, then your sights are too low. You are like a frog in the well, forever unable to accomplish great things." On the way, Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian lectured him solemnly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu could not be bothered to banter with him and was silent along the way. In a trice, they reached East Sun Hall. East Sun Hall was gloomy. Even before they approached, the Spectral Concubine could be seen on the roof of the hall. Her legs were swinging gaily like a happy girl. She asked, "Heavenly Immortals, what might be the purpose of this late night visit?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu said, "Spectral Concubine, today we came here to clarify some things with you. In the month that you are at Capital Wu, you had best not hurt the people of Capital Wu anymore. After all, this is Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian's territory. You have to show him face, is that not so?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Eh? What is it that you are saying? I know not what you speak of." Spectral Concubine affected a confused expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian smiled and said, "That's what I said. It must be your mistake. The Spectral Concubine is a righteous heavenly immortal. Why would she commit such a despicable act as hurting mortals?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Spectral Concubine pursed her mouth and said, "Of course. Sun Wudao, you had better not malign me. I, Spectral Concubine, would definitely not do such things."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both were playing him for the fool. Wu Yu laughed coldly to himself, saying, "Perhaps I saw wrongly. However, Spectral Concubine, I have to warn you. You had best not harm any mortals in Capital Wu. Otherwise, we will personally destroy the offender. Isn't that right, Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On this matter, he had to be insistent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian was seething inwardly, but his words were composed. "Banishing and slaying demons is our responsibility. As the protector of Capital Wu, I definitely cannot allow demons to run rampant...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's fine then. If that's all, then I won't disturb the two of you. But Capital Wu has had some unrest lately. I will be patrolling nightly. If I catch anybody, I will make their existence worse than death!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu finished, knowing that it was roughly wrapped up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian was still worried about those at the sect. On this matter, he had to follow what Wu Yu had said. After Wu Yu left, Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian allowed his thoughts to show on his face. He said, "Spectral Concubine, that trash Sun Wudao has hit a nerve. You have been ill-treated."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Spectral Concubine's expression was dark. She said, "Seems like you want to finish him off as well, though it is inconvenient for you to do so. Since that's the case, leave him to me. On the day that I leave Capital Wu, I'll return to Capital Wu and finish him. Ask his sect to come to the East Sea to hunt me if they will!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sun Wudao has some ability. You must be careful," Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian said. Borrowing a weapon for murder was his favorite way of doing things. The death of Snake Demon Wan Qing was still not avenged yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No worries. I tested his ability today. My Ghostly Dao has a hundred ways of making him regret he came to this world," Spectral Concubine casually said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian was very satisfied with this result. Their grudge was already settled. He continued, "One other thing, which is.... Our Zhongyuan Dao Sect Leader's own son, Jiang Junlin, will be near Capital Wu during this time. You had best not roam out to hunt. I cannot vouch for his moods...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Jiang Junlin?" Hearing that name, the Spectral Concubine's expression was shaken. She waved and said, "Understood. I already told you, I'm a Heavenly Immortal. How would I do such a despicable thing? That Sun Wudao must have been mistaken."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian smiled, saying, "That Sun Wudao is really something. So young, but already with the myopic eyes of the aged. If that is all, then this humble creature will take his leave first."</span></p>
