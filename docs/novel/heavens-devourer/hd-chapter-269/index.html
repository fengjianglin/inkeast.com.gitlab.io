 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was not very experienced, but the demons that he had met were mostly sentimental.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And for humans, there were kind and evil ones. There were people who he respected, like Feng Xueya, but also people he hated, like Zhang Futu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the ghostly cultivators that he had met, like Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain, the Spectral Concubine, and the Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts, they were all cold-blooded, heartless, and cruel. Their actions were disturbing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wanted to massacre a hundred thousand people to collect a hundred thousand hearts! He had formed this Ghost Isolation Array to let himself rise to the Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was such cruelty, such disregard for life!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such a person was the worst existence in this world. Zhang Futu was at most a small terror in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he heard the shameless laughter from Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain, even Jiu Ying’s face darkened. He clenched his fists, which were trembling slightly, and said, “I heard that ghostly cultivators have no morals and are extremely cruel. Seeing you today, I think it’s worse than imagined. Today, I, Jiu Ying have learnt something. Wu Yu, you are right, there is kindness and evil in people. You may not be a kind person, but this ghostly cultivator is definitely someone extremely evil.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are his target too. Let’s kill him together.” Wu Yu restrained the anger in his heart and tried to calm down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying clenched his jaw and said, “I’m afraid that’s going to be very difficult, but since we are trapped here today, we have to kill our way out either way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he was a demon, he had his own way of thinking. He saw things fairly, regardless of race. For a long time, Wu Yu had not met another person like him. He found him likeable and enjoyed chatting with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was also fate that they could fight together today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, their exchange with Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain was very short. The moment Wu Yu and Jiu Ying decided to cooperate and fight their way through, this miniature version of the Ghost Isolation Array immediately changed. Wu Yu and Jiu Ying were just restricted by bloody ghosts. While they tried their best to break through, they had yet to find a way to escape from this miniature version of the Ghost Isolation Array.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We can only stop this if we kill Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain,” Jiu Ying said. He had never killed before, regardless of human or demon. But he knew in his heart that he would have to make an exception today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he spoke, the bloody fog in front moved, and in an instant, the bloody ghosts in the surroundings screamed. They retreated like waves, and before Wu Yu and Jiu Ying’s eyes, a giant shadow suddenly appeared within the moving bloody fog! That shadow was at least six zhang tall. It looked like a giant beast, but when it approached them, Wu Yu realized from the shadow’s silhouette that it was not a giant beast, but a giant. A giant who was six zhang tall. He looked vaguely like Wu Yu’s Vajra Buddha!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no doubt, this was the true appearance of the “demon” that they had seen at Qingsang City!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why would they say that this demon had many heads, and why would He Taozi and the others mistakenly think that that was Jiu Ying? That was because from the silhouette, Wu Yu saw that this giant had six arms, three on the left and three on the right. In a situation where they could not see clearly, those thick, muscular arms were very similar to Jiu Ying’s nine heads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And within this blood fog, Wu Yu saw black flames covering Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain’s body. Except, these flames’ characteristics were different from Jiu Ying’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a whoosh, that giant emerged from the blood fog and appeared before Wu Yu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The giant was black in color, from head to toe. He had six thick, muscular arms, and on the arms were scales that were like rocks. There were even many spikes. The claws on his fingers were sharp like knives, and that thick, muscular body was like an ancient demonic god. His eyes were as big as basins. They were bright red. His face was green and he had fangs. His mouth was bright red and huge, covering at least more than half of his face. When it opened, it was huge. The most peculiar thing was that there was a tiny head on top of this huge head. The tiny head was about the size of an average human head. It was different from that fierce-looking huge head. This head was clean-looking and had little hair. He looked like an elderly man who had one foot in the coffin. He even had a kind smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little children, did your granddaddy’s Spiritual Frame of the Black Mountain scare your young hearts?” Once the other party emerged, the one to speak was not that fierce, large head, but the kind-looking elder on top of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the thing that really disturbed Wu Yu and induced his hatred and anger was not its terrifying looks. It was the bloody corpses on five of its six arms…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And these bodies were like the other martial cultivators. Their hearts had been dug out, leaving a terrifying wound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu could still remember the moment he walked into the Violet Sun Sword Palace and saw these five people and their proud, belittling looks. And today, their faces were frozen in terror, their eyes wide with grievance, staring at all the events unfolding…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were He Taozi, Gong Yangxue, Su Qing, Ye Jingming, Gu Hongming… none of the five had survived…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Other than Wu Yu, all who came from Shushan had died in battle. If not for Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain being cautious of Wu Yu, who was travelling together with Jiu Ying, he would most likely also be a corpse now, hanging on Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain’s last arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dear children, this is my Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain art. Are you able to appreciate it? Truly talented people are lonely. Hence, I guess you guys cannot appreciate my type of art,” Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So frustrating. I have only this one arm left. Yet I still have to carry both you guys, two more corpses. I hate things that do not happen according to plan. Forget it, I don’t want this corpse.” Then, in front of them, he swallowed Ye Jingming’s corpse, emptying one palm for Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain smiled and said, “Only you two are left. I need to think, what is an artistic way to kill you guys?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, it was already a horrifying test. Wu Yu forced himself to not look at the other Shushan disciples. He took a deep breath and put away the Yin Yang Dao Sword. He took out the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column from his Sumeru Pouch. He let the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column surround them. He knew that his own cultivation could not compare to He Taozi’s. The main offense was Jiu Ying. Wu Yu could only see if he could help at crucial moments.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stand behind me.” Jiu Ying was courageous. He was not scared witless by the other party. He transformed into his original body and a demon about the size of the Spiritual Frame of the Black Mountain instantly appeared within this bloody fog, staring down the other party! Jiu Ying was no weaker than the other party in terms of fierceness and aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain suddenly said, “Aiya, I’m regretting this a little. How about I let you leave, leave and do not interfere in my business, okay?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This way, Jiu Ying would not be in danger and could even escape from this miniature version of the Ghost Isolation Array. Actually, this had nothing to do with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After listening, Jiu Ying hesitated, turned back to look at Wu Yu, and then shook his head at Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain. He said, “I don’t like you. I’m going to try getting rid of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He said it in such a relaxed manner, but Wu Yu was still very shocked. Obviously, Jiu Ying knew that once he left, Wu Yu would definitely die. Hence, he had given up the chance to escape and had chosen to participate in a very dangerous battle to death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And at this instant, Wu Yu deeply felt the meaning of friendship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had only just met. It was simply because they thought of each other as decent people that he had made such a choice. This was also a reckless youth. It was only in the spur of the moment that he made such an illogical choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu could not suppress that feeling in his heart. He thought about it. If he were Jiu Ying, he might not have been able to make such a quick decision. After all, who knew how terrifying this Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain was…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wu Yu, aim for a one hit K.O. I have a Natural Mystique. That is my best offensive move. Its power is terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In a while, you move when there is a chance. Just help whenever you can.” At this moment, Jiu Ying secretly instructed Wu Yu, who was hiding behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No problem.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the moment that Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain was belittling them. It was their only chance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as Jiu Ying finished speaking, he attacked!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The demon race was not adept at refining immortal medicines and spirit designs. However, their bodies and Natural Mystiques were envied and most feared by martial cultivators. A Great Dao Mystique came from a Natural Mystique. From here, you could tell how powerful a Natural Mystique was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Weng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In an instant, Jiu Ying’s nine heads tangled together in a peculiar manner. They simply twisted into a mess. From the front, it looked like there was one head in the center, with the other eight in a surrounding eight trigram position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And in the next instant, Jiu Ying’s 18 eyes brightened. In every eye, an ancient bloodline symbol appeared. Every symbol was different. There was a total of 18 symbols, like 18 words!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those 18 ancient words instantly floated out and clashed into each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You could see that every symbol represented a type of power. Of which, the symbols coming from the two eyes from the same head were mostly similar. They were only slightly different, and the power that they presented was the same despite appearing in a different way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For instance, one of the symbols was a black wave, and the symbol from its other eye was pitch black freezing ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The birth of these 18 symbols even caused Wu Yu, who was hiding behind, to feel suffocated. He naturally understood that demons like Jiu Ying, just based on his bloodline alone, were harbingers of disaster. There were many negative powers in his body: corrosion, coldness, darkness, destruction, violence, cruelness, poison, and more. He was practically the nemesis of those legendary auspicious and holy immortal beasts. However, Jiu Ying, who used such evil powers, was indeed a young demon who remained faithful to friends.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Spiral of Disaster.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When these 18 words clashed, they instantly formed a dark whirl. When this whirl expanded, Wu Yu made his preparations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">First, his blood and flesh expanded and he instantly underwent his Immortal Ape Transformation, turning into a golden Immortal Ape!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Next, the surrounding Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column gathered, formed into a golden staff with nine dragons wrapped around it, and appeared in Wu Yu’s hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He then quickly activated his Violent Art. His arms increased in size and became more muscular. His strength increased to its maximum!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And at this moment, Jiu Ying’s Spiral of Disaster blanketed Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain's body immediately.</span></p>
