 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya's arrival caused very little stir.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had been cultivating in the Martial Palace, doing his best to stabilize his two spiritual sources.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was completely immersed in this ultimate spiritual art when he suddenly heard someone call "Wu Yu." He was startled, and immediately opened his eyes. A beam of golden light flew from his eyes, shining at the person in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Respected Master!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had not expected Feng Xueya to appear before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya still looked like the same invincible sword saint. His face was aloof, and the white sword lanyard was extremely cool and did not lend itself to be disdained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The middle-aged man's handsome features would have turned the heads of many a lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's been a few months. You not only successfully condensed your qi, but also reached the second tier of the Qi Condensation Realm. Even to me, that's quite unthinkable!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind his sternness, there was surprise and also pleasure. He could feel the pride behind Feng Xueya's gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Feng Xueya was not presently giving him any guidance, Wu Yu's status and identity had all come from him. He still had the greatest respect for his master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu smiled slightly, neither arrogant nor overly modest. "Why has Master come to Dong Yue Wu? Is there anything urgent?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Wu Yu go for the heart of the issue, he did not beat around the bush either. "I have come to take you back."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Back?" By right, the Immortal Kingdom Supervisor post was for 10 years. Wu Yu should abide for 10 years. It had been but a few months, and now Feng Xueya was personally taking him back?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Wu Yu's doubts, he said, "Two reasons. Firstly, I took a trip to the East Sea a few days ago and paid a visit to the Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts. You killed their disciple, the Spectral Concubine, and they are unwilling to let the matter rest. They will definitely come to Capital Wu to find you, so you must come back with me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could not remain at Capital Wu to protect Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts were famous ghostly cultivators. All of them were fearsome in their own right, and thousands of lives had been taken by their hands. And the main base of the Scarlet Sea, their sea city, was about 10 times the size of the Dong Yue Wu Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before, Feng Xueya had bid him not worry about the Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts, which was why he had personally made a visit down. Clearly, they had been uncompromising, and the matter had not been settled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu knew that since Feng Xueya had come, he would definitely have to return to the Heavenly Sword Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"And the second reason?" Wu Yu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya said gravely, "This is a serious matter. There have been some changes in the Bipo Mountain Range that might bring about changes in the future. Because of this matter, I have already given orders to recall many disciples who are training outside."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What is it?" If even Feng Xueya said this was a serious matter, then it had to be something monumental. This had to be much more momentous than the threat of the Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya said, "This matter concerns you as well. When you return, you will understand."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He would not speak of it now. Perhaps it was too difficult to explain clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Given these two things, it seemed like he was surely destined to return to the Heavenly Sword Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He asked, "Master, when do we go?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Immediately."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had not expected to be separated so quickly from Wu You. If he left, and Jiang Junlin and the Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts returned to look for him, then Wu You would be in danger. Especially since they were ghostly cultivators who did not care about mortal lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What? Something wrong?" Feng Xueya asked upon seeing his hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu You spoke of his clash with Jiang Junlin, and also included Wu You in his story.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya muttered to himself for a while, then fixed his stare on Wu Yu. "Honestly, when one embarks on the path of dao, mortal affairs should be cut off."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Master, I cannot cut them off." In this matter, he stood by his views.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya did not press him. He said, "That's understandable. Alright. On the first point, I'll write a letter to the sect leader of the Zhongyuan Dao Sect, Jiang Xie, and get him to control that wretched son of his who was bullying mortals. On the second point, the Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts, that's a difficult one."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, ghostly cultivators abided by no rules, and it was difficult to control them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Normally, upon learning that you've returned to Heavenly Sword Sect, they would not come to Capital Wu. But in that off-chance...." He frowned and muttered for a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Master, is there any treasure that can protect her? Disciple is not asking for it for free. I will pay Master back in the future," Wu Yu said sincerely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Pay your ass." Feng Xueya stared at him. "I, Feng Xueya, am the master. Would I ask my disciple to return things?! But you've hit the nail on the head. I do have a treasure that can be used in such a situation. But I prepared this for you, it's something that can help you greatly. As for how it is used, I'll respect your decision."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Feng Xueya was an arrogant senior, but he did inspire respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had not thought that his master would have prepared something for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without saying more, he reached into his Sumeru Pouch and retrieved a yellow paper talisman. It was covered with twisted runes that were constantly moving. It was unbelievably wondrous. Two characters could be made out. One was "move" and the other was "protect".</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment he brought this talisman out, the immortal essence in the air around it began to dance. Clearly, they had been affected by the valuable talisman. This talisman was evidently even more powerful and valuable than the Fire Talisman or the Golden Flame Talisman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is the Godly Movement Bodyguard Talisman. I acquired it in an ancient ruin, and it was made my martial cultivators stronger than myself. At least, I cannot make such things. It's my gift to you to protect your life. The moment you sustain a fatal wound, this talisman will trigger automatically. When unleashed, it forms a spherical shield that encloses you. The talisman also has a tail talisman, which I separated from the upper portion. As long as I keep the tail talisman on my body, the Godly Movement Bodyguard Talisman will fly speedily, bringing you back to my side. It guarantees your safety one time. I have two of these talismans. I gave one to Yanli, and kept the other for you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Saying thus, he added one more thing, "The flight of this Godly Movement Bodyguard Talisman. Unless one reaches the Jindan Dao Realm, one cannot pursue it. Although it can only be used once, it's worth a life. Don't you agree it's a powerful treasure?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya had gone to much pains to secure these two talismans, and he was prepared to give them to his two youngest disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, at this moment, it would force Wu Yu to cut off his mortal ties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I have already told you about the benefits of this treasure. In the end, I leave it to you. You decide how you use it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was inspiring about Feng Xueya was that he would not interfere with Wu Yu's decision. That had been made clear from the selection of the Demon Subduing Staff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu looked at this powerful sword saint. Although he had spoken in a detached manner, the depth of his masterly love was contained within. Wu Yu would remember this boon deeply. He received the Godly Movement Bodyguard Talisman. It was indeed worth a life. But Wu Yu was willing to give this life to Wu You.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Master, I intend to give it to my sister."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"For mortals to use it, they require a drop of blood on it. Bring it with her now. I will wait for you outside Capital Wu."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya did not comment on his decision. Clearly, he had already anticipated Wu Yu's choice. Finished speaking, he turned to leave, giving Wu Yu some time to bid his farewells to Wu You.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Thank you, Master!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was said that a teacher for a day was a father for life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Feng Xueya had already left, Wu Yu still kowtowed and showed his respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya was someone who disdained the mortal realm. He had given Wu Yu such a powerful treasure, and he had turned it over to his sister. But Feng Xueya had not stopped him. That was his way of showing love.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Something major had happened at the Bipo Mountain Range, and Feng Xueya did not have much time left. Wu Yu hurried to the Serene Palace to look for Wu You. She was currently reading in the library that the previous emperor had left behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing her, all his words of parting choked up in his throat. He could not speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sis, I'm leaving."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were so many words to say, but he said it simply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright." Wu You smiled lightly. She walked up and adjusted Wu Yu's clothes just like she had in the past. She spoke softly, "Remember to live well. I'll always miss you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sister...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The parting between dao and mortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't be like that. It's not like we won't meet in the future," Wu You said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, they still had time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu You was protected by many martial braves and the threat of Wu Yu. No one knew that Wu Yu had left. In the Dong Yue Wu Kingdom, there were not many mortals who could harm her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for martial cultivators....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu did not say more. He grazed her skin and put a drop of her blood on the Godly Movement Bodyguard Talisman, then pressed it into Wu You's hands. "This is my present to you. Seeing it is like seeing me. Don't let it leave you for even a moment. Even while you are bathing, you must hold it in your hand. Don't worry, it's waterproof and fireproof."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright." Wu You kept the present carefully. She was as clever as she was beautiful. She knew that this was a lifesaving object and that it would let Wu Yu depart in peace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Go on." Wu You patted his elbow lightly with a warm smile. Just like the last time Wu Yu had left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's no different from when you used to lead troops to war. Except now the battles you fight are with martial cultivators."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu understood now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The logic is the same. I won't put my life on the line. Sister, farewell!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu turned and strode away!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Walking out of Serene Palace, walking out of the royal palace, walking out of Capital Wu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To chase his path to immortalhood!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu You stood within the palace, looking after his diminishing figure. Before she knew it, the tears had drenched her clothes.</span></p>
