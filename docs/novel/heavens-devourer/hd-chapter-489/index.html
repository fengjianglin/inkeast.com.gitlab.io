 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The peaceful sea before them was a vivid contrast to the chaos that Ba She had brought upon Emperor Yan's Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Wu Yu descended through the air above the sea, there were still ghostly cultivators in Emperor Yan's Hall who saw this Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator arrive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result, their loud cries sounded out readily!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu is trying to enter the Calm Sea! I know his purpose! He wants the same as the Devious Shadow Ghost Sect! He will destroy the Godly Sea Steadying Needle, and destroy Emperor Yan's Hall!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Godly Sea Steadying Needle was simply too important to Emperor Yan's Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, for countless years, tens of thousands of years, Emperor Yan's Hall had ruled over the Four Islands of the East Sun, with very few real clashes with the divine continent. That was why, for the longest time, nobody in Emperor Yan's Hall had realized that the Godly Sea Steadying Needle would be a target.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, with the eight Emperors present most of the time, who would dare to try anything rash?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even without the eight Emperors present, the 10,000 Ghosts Immortal Extinguishing Design could stop the majority of trespassers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the passing of so much time, the ghostly cultivators within Emperor Yan's Hall had all but forgotten the vulnerability factor of the Godly Sea Steadying Needle. After all, tens of thousands of years had passed without incident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, the Ghostly Emperor's appearance had been sudden. After defeating the eight Emperors, he had mobilized the ghostly cultivators towards the divine continent. The eight Emperors had followed close behind, which was why the Godly Sea Steadying Needle had been left neglected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If not for the sudden appearance of the Devious Shadow Ghost Sect before, the ghostly cultivators of Emperor Yan's Hall would not have even dreamed of such a mission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's appearance here and now was a great opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without another word, he rushed directly into the Calm Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pssht!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After entering, the entire ocean was devoid of even a single current. And even as he broke through the water’s surface, the resulting gap in the water smoothed over rapidly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Descending through the Calm Sea was like sinking through mud. Wu Yu had to use vigorous strength to force the sea water apart. It was clearly seawater, and not a solid, but it was as good as one. That was why Wu Yu's descent was not very quick.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ba She had not come over here, which was why the ghostly cultivators swarmed above him, extremely anxious once they discovered Wu Yu's true purpose!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Legend says that if the Godly Sea Steadying Needle is loosened from its position, Emperor Yan's Hall will be torn apart by the East Sea Swirls!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We are at the heart of the East Sea Swirls! If the entire Emperor Yan's Hall is torn apart, we will undoubtedly die!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How would this Wu Yu know about the Godly Sea Steadying Needle?! An absolute terror! We have to flee quickly!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's no use, the Ghostly Sages have already sealed Emperor Yan's Hall, so we can't leave! The only way is to stop Wu Yu!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Get him! Quick!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After realizing Wu Yu's true goal, the ghostly cultivators were panicking. A few were at the Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea Realm, and directly gave chase, plunging into the Calm Sea!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, their speed in the still water was far from Wu Yu's!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking of the Godly Sea Steadying Needle being destabilized, causing the East Sea Swirls to roar in - how terrifying that image was! Emperor Yan's Hall, which had stood for generations and generations - all the constructions, the countless spirit designs - all would be destroyed in a day! This prospect made the ghostly cultivators so afraid, they felt like they were on the verge of exploding!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was white as a sheet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had gone to invade the divine continent, but had not expected that they themselves would be in such peril. Not only them - the three Ghostly Sages and Yu Fuyao of the Heavenly Seas, who had hidden themselves away, must also be scared out of their wits at this point!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Godly Sea Steadying Needle! That's your goal!" the Supreme Twilight Ghostly Sage howled, still facing Ba She with a grim face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes were filled with deep horror!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And then this being of the Grand Architect Sword Sage's level - even someone who had the chance to become a Primordial Spirit Transformation Realm expert - was engulfed by Ba She's jade-green flames and then swallowed whole by Ba She!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Argh!" Before he died, the Ghostly Sage cried out, but it was to no avail. Wu Yu's offense this time was too unexpected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, the presence of the Godly Sea Steadying Needle had been the greatest surprise for Wu Yu. If not for Emperor Yan's Hall using this Godly Sea Steadying Needle to submerge the sect within the East Sea Swirls, where the spiritual qi was deepest, he would not have such an opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was mostly Ba She's good work. Without Ba She, the three Ghostly Sages would have been sufficient to overcome him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he strained with all his might to continued downwards. The Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea ghostly cultivators at his back had no hope of catching him. The gap between them continued to widen. Right now, Wu Yu had pulled out the Grand Emperor Sword and Chief Emperor Sword and was furiously using them to part the sea water!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his field of vision, the Godly Sea Steadying Needle continued to grow bigger. Before, it had been a speck of blue light, and now he found that he could vaguely make out a pillar. It did not look very big for now - evidently, it was still a distance away - but a dao treasure that could still the East Sea Swirls and stabilize the entire Emperor Yan's Hall could not be a simple thing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Damn you, Wu Yu! You actually knew about the Godly Sea Steadying Needle, and set your mind on it!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The last two remaining Ghostly Sages had fled to the Calm Sea. Seeing this scene, they could not care about anything else in the face of the calamitous prospect of the Godly Sea Steadying Needle being moved. Hearing the agonizing death of the Supreme Twilight Ghostly Sage behind them, they were frightened out of their wits, but still gritted their teeth, pulling their immortal treasures and cleaving their way into the Calm Sea. They rushed past the other ghostly cultivators, charging towards Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They could never have dreamed that their defense of Emperor Yan's Hall in the midst of their assault on the divine continent to blow up in this way!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were moving extremely quickly through the Calm Sea, closing the distance on Wu Yu. Wu Yu calculated. They would catch him before he reached the Godly Sea Steadying Needle. Within this Calm Sea, there was nowhere to run, and he might very well be slaughtered by the enemies!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he was pondering this dilemma, he very quickly laughed. Because Jiu Ying and Ba She were charging after these two Ghostly Sages. Ba She reached the Calm Sea in a flash. His bulbous, jade-green eyes flicked downwards. With a loud hiss, the jade-green flames were again spat downwards. The seawater of the Calm Sea evaporated immediately. The ghostly cultivators caught in the Calm Sea were reduced to ash amidst miserable screams!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ghostly cultivators were all completely slaughtered!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire Emperor Yan's Hall was a mess!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ba She continued to spit fire as it dove into the Calm Sea. At this time, the two Ghostly Sages had yet to be slain. They continued to frantically charge downwards, also chasing after Wu Yu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To them, their only hope of victory was to kidnap Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Ba She's colossal body slithered through the Calm Sea, unhindered by the stilling effect. To Ba She, this Calm Sea was not much different from a normal ocean. That was why he was even quicker than Wu Yu. No matter how unmovable the water was, it was parted readily by his movements!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang, bang, bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the thrashing water, even Wu Yu was sent flying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, I'll directly get Ba She to sweep away the Godly Sea Steadying Needle!" Jiu Ying shouted. Perhaps he had gotten through to Ba She. Ba She was not very intelligent, only knowing to protect Jiu Ying. As long as Jiu Ying told him that sweeping away the Godly Sea Steadying Needle would allow them to leave, Ba She would probably do that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was even better!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Against Ba She, even a good and proper dao treasure would probably offer no resistance. Emperor Yan's Hall had not had a presence of the Primordial Spirit Transformation Realm appear for a while now. Therefore, there was basically no solution for them. When Ba She turned its goal towards the Godly Sea Steadying Needle, all of the ghostly cultivators revealed their despair!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And for Wu Yu, he felt the sense of accomplishment and ecstasy of a huge mission completed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Together with Jiu Ying, they had truly accomplished a miracle! This would definitely deal a punishing blow to the ghostly cultivators!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a change!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What manner of swine! Who dares to trespass in my Emperor Yan's Hall!?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a bellow thundered from the skies above. Instantly, pure white light fired in the direction of the Calm Sea. The light was a Heaven Earth Void technique that caught Ba She, causing a section of his flesh to rot. This made Ba She exceptionally angry, so much so that not even Jiu Ying could fully control him. When faced with such a threat, Ba She immediately switched targets, no longer focusing on the Godly Sea Steadying Needle. Instead, it prudently and furiously faced the new opponent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the midst of the white light, Wu Yu saw a handsome middle-aged man. He had black hair and eyes, and a slender figure. Clean, white skin, and a fierce, sharp look to him. Although he had quite a few years on him, his handsomeness far surpassed a majority of the males that Wu Yu knew. He was a peerless talent of his generation, and the righteousness he exuded made him look like a martial cultivator who championed the orthodox dao. His regal bearing, his white dao robes, and even a horsetail whisk in his hand. He looked like an immortal indeed, with his saintly air!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, his semblance bore many similarities to the woman by his side - Yu Fuyao of the Heavenly Seas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This person had passed the Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea Realm. To Wu Yu, this was an expert on the level of the Mizar Sword Immortal! This caused Wu Yu to immediately think of who this person was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within Emperor Yan's Hall, only one person could be a martial cultivator and not a ghostly cultivator. At least on the surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the Eighth Emperor - Duomingshan Shengxue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who had once been Qin Shengxue, disciple of the Shangyuan Dao Sect's Taixu Sage Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He and Yu Fuyao of the Heavenly Seas looked so similar - he was without question Duomingshan Shengxue!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu would never have dreamed that he would show up here! Hadn't the eight Emperors all gone to the divine continent with the Necro Lord?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter what, this Eighth Emperor was still a Primordial Spirit Transformation Realm cultivator. He was probably evenly matched against Ba She. Their victory and hope, which had seemed within reach, now seemed to have vanished into the unknown again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why would Duomingshan Shengxue appear?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was no longer important. Perhaps the eight Emperors had made some provisions, afraid that the divine continent would jump the gun and send an expert of the Primordial Spirit Transformation Realm to destroy their backlines. That was why they had left an Emperor here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But at least it was clear that Duomingshan Shengxue had not been within Emperor Yan's Hall when Wu Yu had entered and Ba She appeared. He must have come from some location within the Four Islands of the East Sun. Otherwise, he would definitely have shown himself when Ba She appeared, and not waited until now to stop it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And after Yu Fuyao of the Heavenly Seas discovered Wu Yu, the first Message Talisman she had sent must have been to him. That was why he could rush to the scene now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, it was a decent attempt - you gleaned the weakness of Emperor Yan's Hall's, the Godly Sea Steadying Needle, and even contrived to find your way in and throw Emperor Yan's Hall into chaos. But for every foot that dao develops, wickedness develops a zhang. I remember that Ba She is an unthinking, unruly beast. My father will definitely play it out. And having obtained you, these losses to Emperor Yan's Hall are worth it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Fuyao of the Heavenly Seas was laughing lightly again.</span></p>
