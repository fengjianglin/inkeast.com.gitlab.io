 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Yan Huang Imperial City held great attraction for him, and Ming Long clearly wanted to find out what the mystical dragon Commander Luo was up to in Yan Huang Imperial City and how she had been injured, but Wu Yu could not overcome his psychological inhibitions for the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There's no rush. I'll bide my time in the outer city for a while before I decide." In the end, despite Ming Long's peevish anxiety, Wu Yu still decided to compose himself before deciding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was not only afraid that news would travel to Shushan, causing them to disdain him even more. He himself was not sure that he could bear such a drastic switch in identity from a Shushan disciple to a Yan Huang Immortal Army Soldier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before, his master, Feng Xueya, had held high hopes for him, sending him on to Shushan. Who would have thought that he would be cast out from the sect and labeled with the identity of Shushan traitor as he wandered the divine continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then you think on it! But in the end, you will definitely go. The past is the past. The future is the future. People have to look forward, and Nangong Wei is not necessarily prettier than this little female dragon." Ming Long chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her words were becoming more and more overblown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At least right now, Wu Yu felt that he would not ever consider the phrase “dao companion” in this lifetime.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He stood at the door of Wind Flower Snow Moon Palace. He had just obtained more than 40,000 Golden Essence Pills and wanted to find an immortal cultivation inn to hole up in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I should go buy some supreme immortal treasures. Without immortal treasures, it's hard to fight others."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of all the immortal treasures he had returned to Nangong Wei, the one Wu Yu had been most loath to part with had been the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column. It was the immortal treasure which he had used the longest, and was also the most important to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There are tens of thousands of shops selling immortal treasures in the outer city of Yan Huang Imperial City. Which would be good?"&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Wu Yu was preparing to go roam around, he suddenly heard someone calling him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Big Brother Wu, wait for me~"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sweet and delicate voice, very charming. Looking back, it was Feng Er from the Shangyuan Dao Sect sashaying over. She came to stand coyly before Wu Yu, her face blushing slightly. "Palace Master Ji guessed that Big Brother Wu has just come to Yan Huang Imperial City and is unfamiliar with the place. Therefore, Feng Er was sent to ask Big Brother Wu what his plans are. Is there anything that Feng Er can help you with? If there's any place where you can use Feng Er... Big Brother Wu, don't stand on ceremony~"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The female sword cultivators of Shushan Immortal Sect were more calm. The ditzy, honeyed voices like Feng Er were a new experience for Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had just been intending to buy immortal treasures, and naturally needed her to recommend some shops. He therefore said, "You came at the right time. There's indeed something that I need your help with."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Really? That's great! To be able to be of help to Big Brother Wu is my honor. Big Brother Wu, don't hold back~" Feng Er spoke appealingly, her face flushed. This soft and sweet feel took Wu Yu a little off guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Wu Yu say that he wanted to look for an immortal treasure, Feng Er tittered. "Eee! Why didn't Feng Er think of that? I heard that when Big Brother Wu left Shushan, you returned all of your immortal treasures to Nangong Wei. Naturally, you have no immortal treasures on hand, and this is a big thing. Luckily, Feng Er knows the shops in the outer city like the back of her hand. Feng Er will now bring Big Brother Wu to the most suitable shops~~"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Er twisted her lithe waist, leading Wu Yu on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even tales of his immortal treasures had spread. Wu Yu was a little dispirited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Along the way, Wu Yu asked, "Feng Er, why did you say this Hall of Clouds is suitable for me?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Er tilted her head back. "That's because it's a shop owned by our Shangyuan Dao Sect. The one minding business there is Palace Master Ji's senior brother. Big Brother Wu, you are the friend of Commander Jiang and Palace Master Ji. Once I announce your identity, Palace Master Zhang will definitely give you a generous discount. At other shops, you won't get that kind of preferential treatment."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When conducting business outside, connections were indeed important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Xuechuan favored him greatly, and Ji Qingan would go with the flow as well. Right now, he was down and out, and they would definitely not mind putting him in their emotional debt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he could get things for cheaper, Wu Yu would definitely not mind. After all, he only had a mere 40,000-odd Golden Essence Pills. He did not know if these Golden Essence Pills could buy the immortal treasures of his heart's desire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I hear that Big Brother Wu can use supreme immortal treasures. Feng Er is so envious." This little girl kept up the conversation with him in a very lively manner along the way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, there were not many people on the streets of Yan Huang Imperial City who recognized Wu Yu, and not many paid attention to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wu Yu was starting to realize how busy Yan Huang Imperial City was. There were martial cultivators of all cultivation levels around, and there were indeed a few demons about. However, the demons were in human form and looked more amiable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Above the city, walking leisurely would not get one very far. The Art of Sword Flight was necessary, and Shushan disciples naturally flew on the sword. The Shangyuan Dao Sect was different. For example, this Feng Er used an immortal treasure that was a pair of wings attached to her back. She flapped the wings like a bird and flew extremely quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were all kinds of martial cultivators on the street, and they flew in all kinds of ways. Generally, those on swords had a high chance of being Shushan disciples. Wu Yu did not wish to meet them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After about an hour, they had reached the Hall of Clouds. From the outside, this Hall of Clouds seemed even bigger in size than the Wind Flower Snow Moon Palace. It was much larger than the other immortal treasure shops that Wu Yu had seen so far. Evidently, Feng Er had brought him to the place with the most choices.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Big Brother Wu, please follow Feng Er~~"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She brought Wu Yu to the door and spoke a few sentences to the guard. The guard immediately went inside, and Feng Er brought Wu Yu in as well, saying. "Coincidentally, Palace Master Zhang Tiande is present today. In a while, he will personally bring you around to take a look."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, they had just walked into the Hall of Clouds, but Wu Yu was already dazzled by the immortal treasures on display everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This place was not like Shushan. At Shushan, more than 80 percent of the immortal treasures were swords, but here, there were all types. Knives, spears, swords, and halberds; all kinds of weapons were on display. There were even curious immortal treasures, such as rings, necklaces, armor, pagodas, crucibles, canes, horsetail whisks, and gourds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had just walked for a short while and had already seen many immortal treasure types that he had never encountered before. Many had a few major uses, such as offensive, defensive, support types, and many others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was very busy within the Hall of Clouds, and many martial cultivators were here choosing immortal treasures. As for the Shangyuan Dao Sect disciples, it seemed like they could trade using the merits of their sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Er was also very enthusiastically introducing things to Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a while, carefree laughter came drifting by. Wu Yu looked up to see an elder who was portly and getting on in his years, dressed the same way as Ji Qingan. He looked very jolly, and hung a wine jug on his waist. He was still reeking of alcohol.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked like an elder worth his salts, and was clearly one of the Cloud Sea rank friars of the Shangyuan Dao Sect. He had to be the Zhang Tiande that Feng Er had mentioned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, he came up to introduce himself. "Might you be Wu Yu, a fellow dao practitioner? This humble creature is Zhang Tiande, an honor."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Senior Zhang." Wu Yu had no idea how to address him, so he went with seniority.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't stand on ceremony. Forget the ‘senior.’ If you don't mind, just call me ‘Old Brother Zhang.’" Zhang Tiande grinned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In terms of relations, Feng Er had clearly done her due diligence. Zhang Tiande knew of Wu Yu's arrival, and also that Jiang Xuechuan dearly wished for Wu Yu to enlist in the Yan Huang Immortal Army. A firm connection with the Yan Huang Immortal Army was beneficial to business for both senior and junior brother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why he would give face here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And it was Zhang Tiande who picked up the initiative, asking, "And what does the good Brother Wu want to look for today? Within my abilities, I will definitely find the best for Old Brother. Not even ordinary Shangyuan Dao Sect disciples might be able to obtain them."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu did not hold back either. After all, he was here to spend. A simple discount was easy for Zhang Tiande to offer, and it would not cost too much emotional debt. It was just business for both after all. He directly answered, "I want a supreme immortal treasure that is of the same type as the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column was an established immortal treasure of the Yan Huang Immortal Army, and Zhang Tiande would definitely understand these words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why not a sword?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since leaving Shushan, Wu Yu's interest in swords had waned. As for immortal treasures, his first choice would always be the staff. The closer to the Ruyi Jingu Bang, the better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Returning to his roots, it was still something similar to the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column that suited Wu Yu best. When he gripped a staff, his presence swelled to his heart's desire. That was the true him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Understood!" Zhang Tiande immediately had an answer. He led Wu Yu forward with a flushed face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Those who use such immortal treasures are straight of heart, frank of temper, and have a resolute will. They are not easily cowed, and would rather break than bend. Old Brother Wu is such a youthful genius. Respect. Respect!" Zhang Tiande casually fawned over him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That such a high level character was so polite to him was the will of Jiang Xuechuan, and Wu Yu took this into account. For Zhang Tiande, as long as Wu Yu entered Yan Huang Imperial City, then he would definitely be one of the core members within Yan Huang Imperial City. And that meant a good bargain for the Shangyuan Dao Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Do not take advantage of the poor youth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those of seemingly no particular talent might suddenly rise to be dragons with the wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Tiande, Ji Qingan, and the others were betting that Wu Yu would become such a dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Just here!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Tiande opened a set of golden doors, revealing a huge space within. The immortal treasure power was overwhelming. Wu Yu was already rooted to the spot as he entered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Shangyuan Dao Sect was a veritable wealth of treasures!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within this hall, it was all staves, pillars, and club-like immortal treasures. And all were supreme immortal treasures! There had to be more than a thousand!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column was not a supreme immortal treasure. And therefore, each and every object here was stronger than the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column. Besides, they also had all kinds of affinities - wind, fire, water, earth, sun, moon, stars... You just had to wish for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In terms of size, there was much variation as well. Some were as small as a needles, others huge pillars that seemed to hold up the sky. Some could split into many different parts, like the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column, while some were sharp at both ends and could be used as spears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some were thick at both ends, like a meteorite hammer, and emitted a scary light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Supreme immortal treasures' spirit designs demanded perfect balance. And the immortal treasure spirit designs numbered close to 100.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was tongue-tied, completely lost within these thousands of supreme immortal treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wonderful, wonderful!"</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Seeing so many, at least a third suited him.</span></p>
