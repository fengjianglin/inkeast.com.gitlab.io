 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Huang Imperial City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang Immortal Soldiers of the Heaven's Equal Camp had all returned. They had annihilated a substantial number of ghostly cultivators and basically suffered no injuries or deaths. Their excitement was currently at a peak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, knowing that Wu Yu was practicing behind closed doors after they had returned, they didn't disturb Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Huang Imperial City regained its prosperity once again. Within these few days, the City Lord announced the three people who would be participating in the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial. They were Wu Yu, Murong Xu, and Shen Qiuyan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were indeed the strongest among those who were under 50 years old.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, many people were surprised that Wu Yu and Murong Xu had made the list. After all, there were several chiliarchs similar to Shen Qiuyan, who were close to 50 years old and had cultivated for 10 to 20 years more than them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the namelist was announced, many people finally remembered the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial. This was basically the battle for the highest glory on the divine continent. It was also the only opportunity for various geniuses on the divine continent to compete in front of the public. The fervor was starting to rise and the news had spread. There were more and more people who were discussing the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the perilous Battle of Ghosts and Gods, the people couldn't help but be excited about the impending Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fervor and craze finally started off throughout the entire divine continent!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The younger generation was full of vigor and vitality. An ultimate contest that represented each sect would undoubtedly make one's blood boil!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who wouldn't want to be known throughout the generations?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who wouldn't want to win glory for their sects?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who wouldn't want to leave a deep mark on history?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was especially so for second-rate sects like the Heavenly Ares Sect. They only had a single nomination spot. Once defeated, their sect would be eliminated from the contest. They wouldn't be able to fight for the glory and the opportunity to shine before the rest. Under such circumstances, the who was representing them would definitely give it their all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the entire divine continent seemed to have caught fire. The closer it was to the trial, the more people would pay attention to the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Huang Imperial City was the first to announce their nominations. Following which, various sects also started announcing their nominations. Each announcement would bring with it another wave of fervent excitement and craze!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The most regretful thing would be the situation of Shen Xingyao of Shushan. In terms of strength, he ruled supreme as a ninth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator. However, his age was over 50 and therefore he couldn't participate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the Battle of Ghosts and Gods, Wu Yu had destroyed Emperor Yan's Hall. In addition, as he was related to Luo Pin, his inclusion in the namelist was undoubtedly eye-catching! Everyone's understanding of his strength was, in fact, still at the time when he defeated Nangong Wei and Beishan Mo at the Shushan Immortal Sect. Naturally, no one believed he would emerge victorious in the end. However, with a focal character joining, this iteration of the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial would also attract the attention of more people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those with the highest chances of winning were those who were close to 50 years old. For example, Shen Qiuyan, who was the champion of the Trial of Huang, was 49 years old. He was also a ninth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator! He was already at the level of the Yan Huang Generals. His strength exceeded that of many people and he was definitely one of the most popular choices of eventually becoming the champion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, even when the news of the trial was spreading like wildfire outside, Wu Yu was dead focused. He was racking his brain and focusing all his attention on the two Supreme God Techniques.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were the two strongest Heaven Earth Void techniques he had!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they were also the hardest two Heaven Earth Void techniques that he had mastered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Practicing Heaven Earth Void techniques was even more difficult than mastering a dao treasure. It was especially so for these ancient Heaven Earth Void techniques.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was practicing these two Heaven Earth Void techniques at the same time. The Prime Heavenly Lord Supreme God Technique, which was utilized by the Yan Huang City Lord, and the Ten Thousand Furnace Lords' Supreme God Technique, utilized by the Imperial General. The effects and elemental attributes of these two Heaven Earth Void techniques were different. One was metal, while the other was fire. These two elemental attributes were undoubtedly what Wu Yu specialized in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If I can fully master these two Heaven Earth Void techniques together with the Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean, I will still have my two mystiques, the Unshackled Doppelganger and the Eyes of Fire and Gold. Other than these, I still have the Violent Art, Swift Art, and also the Invincible Vajra Body! My battle prowess will definitely exceed countless people's imaginations!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this age, who wouldn't want to rule supreme in the larger stage and receive the title of being the strongest in the world?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, this also concerned the two larger goals he was pursuing. Therefore, he would want to emerge victoriously regardless of the cost. This was also the reason why he had racked his brain to decipher both techniques throughout the numerous days and nights.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The main might of the Prime Heavenly Lord Supreme God Technique lies in its defense. One can transform into the Prime Heavenly Lord with a layer of Xuan Metal covering their body to achieve an impenetrable body. However, I already have the Invincible Vajra Body. Therefore, although the Prime Heavenly Lord Supreme God Technique is undoubtedly incredible, the effects my true body would gain would only be a marginal improvement! However, although my doppelgangers are strong and tough when attacking, their defenses are fragile and they disappear from a single strike. If they executed this Prime Heavenly Lord Supreme God Technique before a battle and turned into Prime Heavenly Lords with Xuan Metal to protect their bodies, the resistance of my doppelgangers would undoubtedly be strengthened substantially and my overall battle prowess would also increase by leaps and bounds!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This would undoubtedly make up for the weakness of Wu Yu's doppelgangers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, the might of the Prime Heavenly Lord Supreme God Technique didn't just stop at defense. Defense was just one aspect. What was more important was strengthening oneself. After executing it, regardless of whether it was the main body or the doppelgangers, there would be a certain level of power increment. Wu Yu recalled that the Yan Huang City Lord was covered in a layer of gold when he was in battle. That should be a trick similar to this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"As for the Ten Thousand Furnace Lords' Supreme God Technique, it will undoubtedly be a Heaven Earth Void technique specialized in attacking! One for attack and one for defense. The combination of attack and defense... The City Lord had indeed thought it through when he gave me the two Heaven Earth Void techniques."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Wu Yu could master the two Heaven Earth Void techniques, together with the spirit design, Grand Sea Overturning Flame Design, on the Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean, he would have more confidence in his attacks during the world-shocking trial.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Prime Heavenly Lord...."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the scriptures of the old, ancient text, Wu Yu attempted to achieve some connection with the immortal that seemed to be lingering within the dao text.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even with his talent, the progress was still slow. Luckily, the Yan Huang City Lord and the Imperial General had returned to Yan Huang Imperial City. For Wu Yu to win it all, they guided him personally and separately. They were exceptionally well-versed in their respective Heaven Earth Void technique. With them guiding Wu Yu personally, Wu Yu's comprehension speed was 10 times as quick as usual.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was what the cultivation world was about. A master played an extremely huge role.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the aspect of raising one's cultivation level and understanding dao, as each person had their own dao, the guidance that they could give him might not be useful. In fact, the guidance might even lead him onto the wrong path.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, in the aspect of mastering dao techniques, there was a more definitive answer. One would roughly take the same path to master a dao technique to the fullest. Therefore, if one had the guidance of another person, the improvements would be much quicker and apparent. This type of instant conversation to clear up doubts one might have was even more effective than when Wu Yu was looking through spirit designs and deciphering the experiences of those who had come before him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, for the Yan Huang City Lord and the Imperial General to guide him personally, there might not be a second person in this world other than Wu Yu who was endowed with such an opportunity. Even Shen Qiuyan and Murong Xu didn't have such an opportunity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial General was even competing with the City Lord as he wished to let Wu Yu master the Ten Thousand Furnace Lords' Supreme God Technique before the other...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Listen to me. My Heaven Earth Void technique is much more incredible than my brother's. His is about creating a turtle shell. Mine is a true offensive technique and is even more incredible than the mystiques of ordinary people!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His progress was slow initially. However, with them giving timely advice, Wu Yu felt that his progress was advancing at a tremendous pace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu would take occasional breaks too to play and interact with his brothers and sisters from the Heaven's Equal Camp. He would also give them some guidance from time to time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they had once protected the Dong Yue Wu Kingdom for Wu Yu, Wu Yu saw and treated them as though they were his brothers and sisters. Whenever there was something to gain or if he had something suitable for them, he wouldn't be stingy. With Wu Yu's help, their improvements were also apparent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There's a strange thing that occured recently. One camp, which we are on good terms with, the Wind Chopping Camp led by Commander Liu, has gone missing. No one was able to find any trace of them and nothing was heard from them," Wu Tianyu commented grudgingly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had a girl he was interested in, and she was in the Wind Chopping Camp. He had also lost contact with her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Everyone has gone missing? Where did they go missing?" asked Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yeah, including a miniature Yan Huang Warship. They went missing on their way back to the divine continent. Based on some accounts, they were last seen nearing the divine continent," Zhen Yu added.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"On the way back to the divine continent? Did the remains of the ghostly cultivators intercept them?" asked Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No one really knows. That's what everyone is guessing. However, Commander Liu is a fourth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator. He is also one of the strongest centurions around. There are also more than a dozen Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivators in the Wind Chopping Camp. To stop all of them from even sending out a Message Talisman and completely annihilating them, their opponents definitely have to be very strong. Would there still be the ghostly cultivators that are this strong?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu pondered over it and instantly had an image of a person. He said solemnly, "That should be the Eighth Hell Emperor, Duomingshan Shengxue."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most of the Ghostly Sages had died. The only Primordial Spirit Transformation Realm ghostly cultivator of Emperor Yan's Hall that was still alive was him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, he was the champion of the previous Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fang Chaoqun shook his head and said, "There are many people who believed it was him. However, as the Eighth Hell Emperor, what is his objective in doing so? Revenge? I don't think that is necessary. If he wanted revenge, it would not be just one camp. A character like him wouldn't have to be so sneaky."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This argument was also reasonable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu couldn't come up with a conclusive answer. If he wasn't in a rush, he would like to investigate the matter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Several generals have headed there to search for over a month. However, nothing was found. It is said that the Imperial General made a trip there several days ago too. He also didn't discover anything. Over 100 people disappearing into the thin air. That's indeed a little strange."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they were on good terms with the Wind Chopping Camp, they were feeling a little melancholy. Clearly, the Wind Chopping Camp had most likely encountered a mishap.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was not surprising now to Wu Yu as the Imperial General hadn't been appearing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the Imperial General had gone and couldn't find anything, he wouldn't be able to help either. Wu Yu could only continue to decipher the two Supreme God Techniques. At the same time, he was paying attention to the development of this matter. As time passed, the outcome was still the same. No one managed to find any clue.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was said that Liu Yicheng still had his wife and kids. Over the last few days, they were still searching for him frantically at the East Sea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who could it be......?" Wu Yu frowned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking towards the east, the entire world still seemed to be peaceful.&nbsp;</span></p>
