 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The 10,000 Swords Formation required all nine to sit in defense. If a single one were to leave, the 10,000 Swords Formation would take severe damage if attacked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The enemies might even completely break through the 10,000 Swords Formation and rush into the Bipo Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That would be extremely perilous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why Feng Xueya and the others had not left the place in two months. It was difficult to know what was happening with their enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And from the information they gleaned from these two months, their enemies seemed to be waiting for a formation-dismantling expert to arrive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were temporarily at a loss, unsure of what to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If such a person really exists, we have to know everything about that person. Are they a Jindan power? Have they arrived?" Lan Huayi said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But their strongest nine had to stay here. How could they gather intelligence?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And if the enemy suddenly attacked, it would be difficult for them to retreat here. Such a risky undertaking could not be considered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, Night Wishes for Snow said, "I can sneak out the next time they attack the 10,000 Swords Formation. I will approach their base camp, and see if I can find out any news.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing Night Wishes for Snow speak thus, the ninth tier Qi Condensation elders also stepped forward, willing to participate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Night Wish is the pillar of our future. He cannot be risked. Let us go in his stead," they urged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night Wishes for Snow shook his head. "We are in the midst of a crisis. As the eldest disciple of the Sect Leader, I should be willing to contribute my strength, and even my life. All of you need not argue this matter."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His attitude was righteous and calm, worthy of admiration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had been considering this matter as well. When Night Wishes for Snow stood forward, he joined him, saying, "Esteemed elders, please leave this matter to myself and First Senior Brother. At the first sign of danger, I can use the Art of Sword Flight to return to the 10,000 Swords Formation at the fastest speed."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Others at the ninth tier of the Qi Condensation realm could not possibly run faster than Jiang Xie and the others. The distance was just too great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wu Yu spoke up, Feng Xueya nodded with pride. "This matter will be left up to the pair of you. The safety of our Heavenly Sword Sect is on your shoulders. But remember - do not throw away your lives; be careful always."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were unable to leave the 10,000 Swords Formation, but the need for information was urgent. Only those at the ninth tier of the Qi Condensation realm and above were up to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two disciples made Feng Xueya especially proud. Since they were willing to step forward, Feng Xueya would definitely support them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I am proud of the both of you." Feng Xueya looked at them, speaking clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Master, don't worry." There was so much that he wanted to say, but that was all he could manage. Wu Yu knew that it was time for him to fight for the sect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The kindness of his master was a debt that had to be repaid. That was a rule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The 20-odd Spirit Concentration Pills that he had borrowed were now all converted into spiritual power that coursed throughout his body. It was a rush of hot, liquid power that had been bestowed on him by the brothers and sisters of the Heavenly Sword Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were no sad feelings, only the passion of a man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And at this moment, the 10,000 Swords Formation shook violently from the recommencement of attack. However, it was as lacklustre as the previous day's. From this alone, it seemed like the person they were waiting for was almost here. Otherwise, they would not be selling the fake so lazily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Junior Brother, let's go!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sword dao guided their hearts. Without a shred of hesitation, Night Wishes for Snow preceded him into the 10,000 Swords Formation. Feng Xueya and the others had opened a safe path for them to leave easily. But on the other side, they faced a stiff battering from Jiang Xie and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were employing dao techniques to bring wind and fire against the formation. It was another clash of strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the Disorienting Mist Formation present, it was not easy for them to enter. They would need at least an hour.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu again dived into the 10,000 Swords Formation. His heart could not help but long to use his own Spirit Designs. One Spirit Design alone was incredibly powerful. Anyone who entered a Spirit Design would be trapped, having to fight the elements of nature itself. Against a mortal army, the whirlwind of swords could have cut down a million men.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And above their heads, longswords continued to whistle by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were out of the 10,000 Swords Formation. There was nothing but forest before them. The two hid in the scrub, advancing cautiously. With all of the strong fighters within the 10,000 Swords Formation, the strongest within the camp were a few ninth tier Qi Condensation Zhongyuan Dao Sect disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a while, they could see the base camp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On one side was a sea of demons. On the other was the laughing and chatting disciples of the Zhongyuan Dao Sect. They were extremely at ease, carefree smiles plastered on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was precisely them who had caused the Heavenly Sword Sect to sink into the troubled state that it currently was in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu and Night Wishes for Snow both hated them with deep feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If we get close, we will definitely be found out by them. But if we do not get near, how will we know their plans? Junior Brother, do you have any ideas?" Night Wishes for Snow frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On their way here, Wu Yu had been racking his brain for solutions as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His gaze fell on the few ninth tier Qi Condensation disciples. Before he left, Wu Yu had been afraid of them. But no longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were the elders of the Zhongyuan Dao Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"See that one with the purple eyes?" Night Wishes for Snow pointed at a person who was surrounded by the other elders. They seemed to treat him as the leader. They were enjoying wine and talking about something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That person had an exceptional quality about him. He looked to be about the same age as Night Wishes for Snow, and the most striking feature about him was a pair of purple eyes. It was terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I see him." Wu Yu had seen him before, often standing by Jiang Xie's side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's Jiang Xie's first disciple. He's my old rival." Night Wishes for Snow narrowed his eyes. It was his old enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had killed Jiang Junlin and Mo Xiudao. Jiang Xie had a total of three disciples, one of which was his son. And now, only his oldest disciple, Qinghua of the East, was left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, Wu Yu suddenly thought of an idea. "Senior Brother, I feel that eavesdropping may not yield the information we want. We have to kidnap somebody. Moreover, this person must be at least at the ninth tier of the Qi Condensation realm; otherwise, it is likely they will not know Jiang Xie and the others' true plans."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Well said. But how do we accomplish this?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu looked over, his gaze going hard. "You go and kill a few people to attract their attention. Seeing you, they will definitely send two or more to chase you. You escape when you can. I'll be lying in ambush at the side, unseen. When the opportunity presents itself, I'll go nab one and then bring the person to you using the Art of Sword Flight. Once we link up, we immediately return to the 10,000 Swords Formation! As long as Jiang Xie and the others do not come out, they cannot catch me with the Art of Sword Flight."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, the Art of Sword Flight was Wu Yu's greatest weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Although it is a risk, I think this is the only way. Junior Brother, you're even more brazen than I am!" Night Wishes for Snow considered it, and then committed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Senior Brother, you must judge it carefully. Do not let them surround you." This plan would test Night Wishes for Snow severely as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't worry, that's easily enough done. You, on the other hand, have to take down somebody quickly. That's much harder."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Senior Brother, run around the 10,000 Swords Formation as you make your escape. When I find you, we can enter the 10,000 Swords Formation at speed."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No problem."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After fleshing out the details, Wu Yu hid along the path of Night Wishes for Snow's escape. As for Night Wishes for Snow, he pulled out his immortal treasure longsword, shifting into a beam of golden light that flashed towards the Zhongyuan Dao Sect disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Qinghua of the East!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hundreds of Zhongyuan Dao Sect disciples were basking in the daylight, extremely relaxed. Suddenly, a sword cultivator rushed out of the trees, attacking without a word. A blizzard tore through them, rampaging and ravaging. In the blink of an eye, more than 10 disciples at the third to fifth tier of the Qi Condensation Realm were dead, their corpses littering the plain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Zhongyuan Dao Sect disciples are of the orthodox path. Yet you fraternize with demons and ghostly cultivators! You are worse than swine. I, Night Wishes for Snow, will kill every single one of you that comes against me!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He bellowed his laughter. Night Wishes for Snow went through them like a scythe harvesting the wheat. A sweep of his sword, and corpses fell to the floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Qinghua of the East. You trash. Dare you compare yourself against someone on my level?" Night Wishes for Snow was extremely warm towards his own brothers, but he was a copy of Feng Xueya against outsiders. He never hesitated when he killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Swine!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qinghua of the East had been chatting gaily with others when such a thing had actually happened. His face immediately changed. He rushed out of the circle, chasing. His face was grim, his purple eyes flashing. Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Looking to die?!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other elders had come rushing as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Zhongyuan Dao Sect was suddenly thrown into chaos. The demons were laughing at their misery. They only watched the battle, but offered no aid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night Wishes for Snow, seeing the disciples of the ninth tier Qi Condensation cultivator come killing, did not stop, turning immediately to leave. Things were proceeding as planned, and he rushed into the forest without a backward glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Scoundrel, don't you dare try to leave!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, seeing an old enemy like Night Wishes for Snow, Qinghua of the East was even more incensed, immediately giving chase and leaving the rest in the dust. Instead, it was the other elders who hesitated. They numbered five, and they wanted to dissuade Qinghua of the East from chasing. They were worried that it was a trap, but they were too late. Qinghua of the East had already left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They hesitated for a while, then decided to leave three on guard. The other two followed behind Qinghua of the East, taking up the chase as well. But they were a considerable distance behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A total of three people, one in front and two behind!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A chase through the forest!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night Wishes for Snow was a sword cultivator, so his speed was ferocious. It was fairly tiring for Qinghua of the East to catch up with him. However, Night Wishes for Snow purposely slowed to allow him to keep up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He continued to run the loop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was not far away from Qinghua of the East. His powerful physique traversed through the forest at speed, and very quickly locked on to Qinghua of the East.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind Wu Yu were two elders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The original plan was to take the straggler. But there are two behind, and Qinghua of the East is alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If the last one was alone, I would have ample time to deal with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"But now, I might as well choose Qinghua of the East. He is of high status, and his chances of being cognizant of the core secrets are higher. Besides, catching him will be about as good as capturing Jiang Ding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Although the two elders behind will catch up in a few breaths' time, choosing Qinghua of the East means that I can join forces with Senior Brother in an instant!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was rapidly changing his plan as he pursued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Next up, we'll see if I have synergy with Senior Brother!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they were on the same page, they could pincer him in an instant!</span></p>
