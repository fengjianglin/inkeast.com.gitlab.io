 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One day, a group of sword cultivators arrived and descended on the remains of the Wind and Thunder Dao Sect in a mighty formation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The leader of this group wore a purple robe and was as beautiful as a flower. She was none other than Shen Xingyu. She was a little anxious after having looked through several places. In the end, the group gathered at the Wind and Thunder Dao Sect. Based on what the local forces had claimed, they had found the corpses of Shushan disciples in this place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Shen Xingyu received Wu Yu's Message Talisman, she caught up with the team that had set off two days earlier. She told them that the battle had ended and that the truth behind the incident had been uncovered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Soul Hall noticed the death of five Huang sword rank disciples, Shushan immediately sent over twenty Huang sword rank disciples as reinforcements. Among them, some were Earth sword rank disciples who were eighth and ninth tier Jindan Dao cultivators.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the way, Shen Xingyu explained the development and outcome of the incident clearly to the team. The Huang sword rank disciples, who were initially on high alert and prepared for any eventualities, heaved a huge sigh of relief upon learning that the incident had ended.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they raised a few questionable points.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">First, it seemed as though a demon had strayed into the area. Just what kind of demon was it and what was its strength level?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Second, Wu Yu was just a third tier Jindan Dao cultivator. Despite having the demon to help him, how could he possibly kill the ghostly cultivator that could even kill He Taozi? Logically speaking, Wu Yu should be the weakest in the team and the easiest target to be killed directly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, Shen Xingyu answered that all questionable points could be resolved once they met up with Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the group arrived at the scene, they found the corpses of He Taozi and his team. The group immediately crowded forward. The state of He Taozi and his team was undoubtedly utterly miserable. Wu Yu hadn't gotten the chance to sort out the corpses when he got taken away by Ba She.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He Taozi, Ye Jingming, Gu Hongming... These were all outstanding young disciples in Shushan. Their masters happen to be in closed door cultivation. Otherwise, they would likely have rushed over upon hearing the news."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I heard there's a Heaven sword rank disciple on his way here. He will probably arrive in a while."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh, right, isn't Wu Yu still alive? Where is he? He had so much time! Why didn't he help tidy up the bodies his senior brothers and senior sisters?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few men was displeased and started shouting and looking for Wu Yu. However, they couldn't find Wu Yu despite looking around for some time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Shen Xingyu, Wu Yu should have told you about his location when he communicated with you. Am I right?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Xingyu was baffled by the situation and answered, "He said that he would be waiting for us in the vicinity of the Wind and Thunder Dao Sect. Why is he missing now?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She couldn't find Wu Yu either.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, the group was baffled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Xingyu observed the surroundings attentively before adding, "Perhaps he left for something temporarily. Let's wait for him. I have some questions for him too."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The group wasn't particularly in a rush.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I just got the information on Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain. His cultivation level is either seventh tier or eighth tier of the Jindan Dao Realm. He specialized in spirit designs and therefore these Sect Protecting Spirit Design are largely ineffective against him. He Taozi dying in a battle with him would be also within expectations. This ghostly cultivator is too cunning! Who would have thought he would use such a method to draw Shushan disciples here? We definitely have to make him pay for it!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who are you going to ask for payment? This guy doesn't have any kin or even friends. Can it be that you want to slay all the ghostly cultivators on the continent?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This incident caused a certain level of shock throughout Shushan. Their mission here this time would include the heavy responsibility of investigating the incident clearly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The group kept the corpses of He Taozi and his team away. After which, they mobilized the people from the remaining six forces to bury the unfortunate victims in this incident. Naturally, as Shushan was supposed to be providing protection to them, they gave these forces a little consolation so as to allow them to walk out of the horror quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After questioning the city lord of Qingsang City, the group roughly understood the situation with the demon that Wu Yu had reported. However, the city lord had been on the run all along. He wasn't particularly clear of what happened to the Wind and Thunder Dao Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The initial plan was to wait for Wu Yu to return. However, there was no sign of him for an entire day, and the group was getting impatient. Therefore, Shen Xingyu decided to split up to look for him. The group of over 20 people separated and search almost the entire vicinity in half a day. However, they still couldn't find any signs of Wu Yu. In the end, when they gathered again at the Wind and Thunder Dao Sect, the group was getting frustrated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among the group, a very young Huang sword rank disciple stepped up. He was none other than Zhao Xuanxian. When he heard about the incident and learned that it concerned Wu Yu, he requested to come over too. At this moment, he said solemnly, "Various seniors, Wu Yu has not showed himself till now. I believe everyone has a lot of questions like me. Let me just state my queries. I question the authenticity of the information Wu Yu that wrote in the Message Talisman. I feel that there are too many questionable points. The truth that he has claimed might very well be made up by him. In fact, the existence of the ghostly cultivator might just be a ruse."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Xingyu stared harshly at him and remarked, "Nonsense! I have heard about the Ghost Isolation Array, and it’s clear that there are parts of the Ghost Isolation Array bases in the vicinity. Moreover, only someone like Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain would be capable of such. Demons are not good at spirit designs."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone knew that Zhao Xuanxian was still vengeful from losing to Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Xuanxian wasn't willing to back down and added, "That only means that he did not defeat Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain with that demon. Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain isn't dead yet and Wu Yu has escaped. He is probably afraid of bearing the responsibilities and therefore made up the lie."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Xingyu retorted, "Whether Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain is dead, we do not know. However, even if he isn't dead, Wu Yu has no need to weave a lie like this. His strength level is below that of Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain in the first place. Even if he ran back to Shushan, that is also the right thing to do. Zhao Xuanxian, don't be so petty and vengeful!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing what Shen Xingyu said, Zhao Xuanxian blushed and growled angrily, "I just don't believe that he could kill Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain with his capabilities, even if he had the help from the demon! In fact, he might be colluding with the demon and has gone against the basic rules of a Shushan disciple! I suspect that he is too ashamed of returning to Shushan after colluding with the demon. Therefore, he has fled the scene."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was loud and clearly pissed. However, no one was paying attention to him at this moment. This was because everyone knew that the truth would only be uncovered when they saw Wu Yu and heard his side of the story.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain, it was clear that his Ghost Isolation Array wasn't successful. He might be dead or might have escaped.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, Shen Xingyu clearly trusted Wu Yu. She knew that Wu Yu wouldn't lie about the matter. Therefore, her only question was where Wu Yu was!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Can it be that he has returned to Shushan already? Or perhaps something beyond his control happened after he sent me the Message Talisman?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She ordered the rest to investigate the matter, while she followed the traces of clues to look for Wu Yu. She roughly understood that Wu Yu had remained around for a short period of time. However, there wasn't any sign of him heading to other places. It was like he had disappeared into thin air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The whole investigation continued for a month. Shen Xingyu also learned that Wu Yu had not returned to Shushan through Message Talismans. She even made use of her networks to ask the surrounding sects around Shushan to keep a lookout for Wu Yu and to inform Wu Yu to return to Shushan as soon as possible. However, what really baffled her was that Wu Yu seemed to have vanished into thin air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regarding the truth of this matter, there were several stories that were circulating in Shushan. After all, there were too many questionable points in it, and it was hard for others to make their own assumptions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were even people who speculated that Wu Yu had allied with the demon and ghostly cultivator to kill his senior brothers and senior sisters. After robbing them of their belongings, he had fled to the East Seas, where ghostly cultivators gathered, to be a ghostly cultivator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Xuanxian had gone to the scene and therefore had many people asking for his opinions. Therefore, Zhao Xuanxian listed his queries and directed others to doubt Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Truth be told, the death of five Huang sword rank disciples was a massive incident. However, as this incident was too confusing, no one was able to truly find out what had happened after a long time. In the end, it was said that Heaven sword rank disciples took on the investigation. Through analysis of the various traces left behind, they confirmed the presence of Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain and that he had eventually died. As for Wu Yu and the reported demon, they seemed to have vanished into thin air without leaving any traces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As time passed, people started to accept the fact that the emerging exceptional talent had gone missing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rumors had it that Shen Xingyu did not give up and spent a full two months looking for Wu Yu. However, it proved to be a futile attempt.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On a day two months later, Shen Xingyu was standing on the flat ground at the Wind and Thunder Dao Sect. Through the investigation by the Heaven sword rank disciples, they had learned that Wu Yu and that demon seemed to have been trapped deep underground by a spirit design known as Gates of Hell. However, a domineering power erupted from within the ground that toppled the earth of the vicinity with a radius of several hundred miles. After which, there was a huge life and death battle with Ghostly Wings of the Black Mountain at the same location.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh, Wu Yu! Child, what really happened here?" Amidst the slight wind, the purple earrings on the ears of Shen Xingyu made a crisp sound like an aeolian bell.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, stardust appeared in the skies and a human figure vaguely formed in front of Shen Xingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother, how was it? Did you find him?" Shen Xingyu asked agitatedly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other party shook his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was none other than the Galaxy Sword Sage, Shen Xingyao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"A horrifying demon appeared in the vicinity recently. The most likely explanation is that Wu Yu was taken away by it," answered Shen Xingyao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If even you felt horrified by it, what is..."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm not sure. It's far beyond me now."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Xingyu felt bottled up. Why would Wu Yu encounter such an existence...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What should we do then?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He can only rely on himself on this matter. There's nothing I can do, and the other people in Shushan won't be able to help him."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright. He's a great child. What a shame." Shen Xingyu bit her red lips and looked a little depressed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh, right, Brother! You have been paying attention to him. Why didn't you take him in as your disciple then?" This was something that Shen Xingyu hadn't been able to understand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Xingyao pondered for a moment before answering, "His dao is different from mine and so is his temperament. There's nothing I could have taught him. All I could have given him was some protection. However, protection might not be in his best interest. It might be better for him to experience various trials so he can grow to become stronger. Not accepting him as my disciple is for his own good."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Now that no one knows if he's dead or alive, do you still think that your actions are right?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Xingyao answered without hesitation, "If he can emerge from this difficulty, it will be the time he really shines!"&nbsp;</span></p>
