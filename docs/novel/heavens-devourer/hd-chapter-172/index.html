 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Riipppp!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dozens more evil ghosts rose up into the air!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, they were torn corpses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under Wu Yu's protection, their first pass through the army of evil ghosts and vengeful spirits yielded virtually no deaths, although about a hundred disciples were possessed by vengeful spirits and were unable to shrug free. There were only a few injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At least 200 vengeful spirits entered Wu Yu's body, furiously trying to control him. Until they were destroyed by Visualizing the Inner Ape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Through this process, Wu Yu had also killed two of the ninth tier Qi Condensation cultivators who had rushed into the group of Heavenly Sword Sect disciples, as well as a 900-year demon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Golden sword light scythed out. No one could stop him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With him at the point, the Heavenly Sword Sect disciples looked triumphant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first rush had culled more than 800 of the 2,000 evil ghosts! A majority had been torn to bits by Wu Yu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's hands were full of blood - evil ghost blood!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This charge had fanned the battle will of the Heavenly Sword Sect disciples to a new high. They tore into the evil ghost army so quickly that the army had to turn back on itself. And before Wu Yu, he realized that those before him were half demons and half Zhongyuan Dao Sect disciples!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had been carried away, yelling their battle chants. In the short space of 10 breaths' time, Wu Yu had already torn through the ghostly cultivators and come head to head with them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evil ghosts threw their lives away mindlessly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But those before him were warm and living martial cultivators and demons!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Especially the Zhongyuan Dao Sect ones!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were already scared out of their skin by Wu Yu. Now he appeared with a huge, golden sword. The speed of his strike was such that those at the third tier of the Qi Condensation Realm and below could not even dodge. A single slash cut down dozens of people immediately, painting the battlefield with their blood!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to the evil ghosts, the deaths of martial cultivators was even more shocking!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No one from the Zhongyuan Dao Sect will be allowed to back down. Die!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu laid into them, bellowing. His Great Dao of the Golden Sword slashed out twice more, and even more disciples died immediately. They did not even have a chance to use dao techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From behind Wu Yu, hundreds of bursts of sword qi flew past!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sword Sect's presence and killing intent, added to their hostile eyes and strong will to defend their sect and kin, added to Wu Yu's might. It pierced the heart of every Zhongyuan Dao Sect disciple like a sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I yield!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I yield, I lose! We surrender!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After seeing those around them drop like flies, many crumbled while they were on the verge of being cut down by Wu Yu. They wet themselves with fear as they rolled on the floor. And then they scrambled frantically to their feet, running away as though possessed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"None of you leave! All must die!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night Wishes for Snow led the Heavenly Sword Sect onwards, yelling at the top of their voices.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, they did not want to kill anymore. This immortal war still centered around the main instigators. Wu Yu alone was attacking their will. Killing more of them would be a complicated affair, which was why he had chosen terror as his primary weapon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Wu Yu again hefted his sword, the Zhongyuan Dao Sect disciples crumbled. Hundreds turned to flee, screaming. Even before the battle started, they had already lost. Dozens more who were reluctant to leave also turned tail after Wu Yu killed more of them - and some of the Zhongyuan Dao Sect elders were amongst their number.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All that remained were the demons!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu killed a few demons, but these demons were still savage and fearsome. Whether they lurched or crept forward, their demonic aura rocketed - it was the only thing that could face Wu Yu at this time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"All who do not leave will die." Wu Yu issued his final threat, but there was no response. Their loyalty to the Ninth Spirit was strong, and they were much more courageous than the Zhongyuan Dao Sect disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu glanced back at the evil ghosts congregating. They would soon regroup for another attack. He did not have much time left. He lifted his sword anew, preparing for another massacre! These demons alone could not stop him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But at this time, the Ninth Spirit's voice floated over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"All of you, back down for now."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She actually bid the demons withdraw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu started.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The demons were extremely obedient to her commands. Although they grumbled, discontent with their orders, they still turned and shapeshifted back to their human forms, bearing the palanquin as they left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they had not left, Wu Yu was confident that he could kill every last one of them. But the Heavenly Sword Sect side would definitely take casualties in the process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not want to let even a single member of his sect die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And now, with the Zhongyuan Dao Sect disciples scattering and hiding back in the deeper mountains, a majority had given up entirely on the battle. With the demons also in retreat, Wu Yu and the others only had the evil ghosts to face now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"All of you defend here. I will fight these evil ghosts."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu bid them secure their position. There were still a few at the ninth tier of the Qi Condensation Realm, as well as the Elders of Imparting Arts and Enforcement. As long as they did not meet any of the 10th tier Qi Condensation cultivators, they would be safe for the moment. Wu Yu prepared to slaughter the rest of the evil ghosts alone!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We're counting on you, Wu Yu!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Take care, Junior Brother...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Kill them all!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the light of their reverent gazes, Wu Yu again plunged into the midst of the evil ghosts!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One man and one sword actually stopped the thousands of evil ghosts and vengeful spirits!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few hundred evil ghosts had made it past him, but they were quickly destroyed by the Elders of Imparting Arts and Enforcement. The true power of one of the evil ghosts was roughly the strength of a first tier Qi Condensation cultivator. They were not powerful, but they had the strength of numbers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All over the battlefield, a golden sword flashed. Each slice saw evil ghosts fall, crumbling into ash. The huge, golden sword burned brilliantly, intense enough to immolate the evil ghosts completely!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Including Wu Yu, there was a total of eight battles. But in terms of scale, Wu Yu's was the biggest. Of course, only at this level could they suppress them. As the number of evil ghosts dwindled, the vengeful spirits could only confuse people, with no follow-up!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless vengeful spirits surged into Wu Yu's body, but none returned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After about 30 breaths of time, the 2,000 evil ghosts had been whittled down to about 100. They were no longer effective. Although there were still vengeful spirits, they were useless on their own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the mid-tier battle, Wu Yu alone had swept it clean!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Zhongyuan Dao Sect on the run, the demons withdrawn, the evil ghosts defeated!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If there had been just one of the 10th tier Qi Condensation cultivator occupying Wu Yu's attention, the Heavenly Sword Sect disciples would have been decimated thoroughly by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had not thought that he would reach the eighth tier of Qi Condensation. It was the Ninth Spirit who had given him the opportunity. He could only say that his fate and luck were better than the Ninth Spirit's!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the evil ghosts could no longer pose a threat to the Heavenly Sword Sect, Wu Yu knew that it was time for him to enter the stronger battles, on the side of the Five Elders! With him entering the fray, the odds of victory would be heavily skewed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was currently quite far from the Five Elders' position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had already anticipated this. The most fearsome amongst the five enemies had to be Tian Yijun! The leader of the Scarlet Sea's Seven Ghosts. If he were killed, then he could work with the Five Elders to completely wipe out the other demons, ghostly cultivators, and Zhongyuan Dao Sect members!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After one last scourge to ensure that the evil ghosts would no longer threaten the Heavenly Sword Sect disciples, Wu Yu took to the skies on his sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, he had finished up the evil ghosts without taking too much time - not even 100 breaths of time had been required.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the Five Elders' fight, he very quickly found Elder Shentu and Tian Yijun. However, his face changed when he arrived!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tian Yijun was indeed terrifying. There was a fog of blood cloaking his battlefield, obscuring the vision of his opponents and preventing those outside from seeing the situation within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fog of blood was like a huge blood cocoon. It pulsed like a living thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The stench of blood permeated the entire Bipo Mountain Range, causing a sense of uneasiness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But just as Wu Yu prepared to rush in, the fog of blood actually dissipated, and the battlefield became clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A chill ran through Wu Yu as he saw what had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The floor was stained with fresh blood. In a radius of 100 zhang, the ground, rocks, and mountains themselves were practically all covered in fresh blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tian Yijun's squat body was perched on a rock. His veil had already flown away, revealing a withered, shrunken face that was extremely grotesque. Even within his wrinkles one, could see fresh blood dripping down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes were mismatched in size. The larger one was as big as an open mouth, the smaller one the size of the little finger's thumbnail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His larger eye was covered in blood vessels, which writhed like worms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But that was not the truly startling sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truly startling sight was a column of blood in the ground before him that reached up to more than 10 zhang high. The column of blood was purely black on the surface, covered in a ragtag assembly of scales - it looked like a cross between snake and fish scales. It was like a huge blood vessel, with deep red blood within. A web of bloody capillaries covered the column of blood!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even more startling was that the scales could change position. They continued to reform on the column of blood, forming a ghastly face with red pupils and a huge mouth. It was extremely lifelike, and continued to strike fear into their hearts. It changed faces many times in short order, and each of them was different!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The column of blood had caught Wu Yu's attention. And Wu Yu recalled its name!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya had told him before that Tian Yijun was practically invincible within the 10th tier of the Qi Condensation Realm, and might even be able to resist himself with difficulty. The main reason was his spiritual immortal treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spiritual immortal treasures were high-grade immortal treasures with a spiritual affinity. Their power was much higher than ordinary immortal treasures. In the Heavenly Sword Sect, only Feng Xueya and Lan Huayi had such spiritual immortal treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tian Yijun's spiritual immortal treasure possessed terrible and savage power. It was said that a mighty ghostly cultivator of the East Sea had created it back in ancient times. Besides many valuable ingredients, he had also added the souls of 100 of his enemies through a forbidden dao technique of the ghostly cultivators. The immortal treasure spirit design was a Shapeshifting Design that allowed the spiritual immortal treasure to change size freely between one foot and 10 zhang.<span id="footnote-ref-66a2"><a href="#footnote-66a2">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It also had the Paranormal Possession Design, which would send a hundred ghosts from the spiritual immortal treasure to possess the opponent's body, entering through the air or even their immortal treasure. It created the effect of a hundred vengeful spirits that tore at the enemy's flesh, soul, bones, and organs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lastly, it had the Paranormal Power Design, which gave its user superhuman strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This spiritual immortal treasure was infamous, and was known as the Paranormal Pillar of Blood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What shook Wu Yu most was that the Paranormal Pillar of Blood was currently placed on top of Elder Shentu's rotting body.... &nbsp;</span></p>
