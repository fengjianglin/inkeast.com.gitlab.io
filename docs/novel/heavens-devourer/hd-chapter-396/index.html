 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right before his eyes was the largest Subterranean Treasured Moon Furnace within the Ravaging Ghost Volcano.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Subterranean Treasured Moon Furnace was much bigger than the one Wu Yu had encountered previously. If he had devoured the Treasured Moon furnace here to forge his Invincible Vajra Body, his body would’ve been even stronger!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was as though there was a heavenly furnace before him. The boiling water erupted with great might and the heat wave was pressurizing. Ordinary steel and even the majority of precious treasures with spiritual marks would be vaporized if they fell into it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the Yan Huang Immortal Armor wouldn't be able to withstand the heat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As such, Wu Yu removed his Yan Huang Immortal Armor. His current body was forged by devouring the Subterranean Treasured Moon Furnace. Therefore, he was like a fish in water when he entered it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For him, the surrounding golden lava wasn't much different from the seawater. It was just a little warmer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Black Fiend couldn't do the same. The moment he entered this place, he was forced to use several Heaven Earth Void techniques to protect himself. He acted like a mortal falling into flames. He was drenched in perspiration and was panting violently.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Cangxue Qingfeng, she was slightly better. As her lion body moved within the furnace, she created tremendous waves from within the golden lava.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, why are you still thinking of escaping?" Cangxue Qingfeng caught up with Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Wu Yu still didn't know about the depth of the furnace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If I engage them and pretend to fall below and fake my death, they would definitely go after the Yan Huang Warship. I have to make them doubt it so as to hold them back here for a few days!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the thought of this, Wu Yu smirked and remarked, "Of course I'm escaping to a place you guys can't follow. Want to catch me? It isn't going to be simple."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he laughed, he dived deeper without pausing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You are still diving deeper?" Cangxue Qingfeng was starting to feel the strain on her physical body and dao technique at the current depth surrounded by golden lava. She had not expected Wu Yu to be able to dive deeper!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You must be crazy!" chanted Cangxue Qingfeng furiously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is my territory! It's only natural for me to go wild here! If you aren't satisfied, just come for me." Wu Yu's tone was calm and composed. He was like a fish swimming deeper. His golden skin had almost become one with the surrounding golden lava. The giant furnace around him was just like his body. Cangxue Qingfeng indeed wasn't as used to an environment like this as Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, the Black Fiend was still behind her. Despite having the upper hand, Wu Yu didn't take the risk. What he wanted to know was if there was something he had been searching for for a long time below the furnace....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If you dive deeper, you are courting your own demise!" Cangxue Qingfeng snorted coldly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm going to dive deeper. What are you going to do about that?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From Wu Yu's words, one could infer that he was trying to delay the two of them for a period of time. Judging from Cangxue Qingfeng’s resistance against the Subterranean Treasured Moon Furnace, she likely couldn't enter the hotter region below.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, he was in fact close to the bottom of the Subterranean Treasured Moon Furnace. It was insanely scorching but it could get even hotter if he dived deeper. Wu Yu knew clearly there was something even hotter below the bottom!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This must be it! There's an even larger furnace below, and these eight Subterranean Treasured Moon Furnaces are just extensions of it. Considering the large scale and temperature, it must be a Subterranean Blazing Sun Furnace! Who would have expected the Subterranean Blazing Sun Furnace to appear here instead of on land. What a miracle!" Ming Long exclaimed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu heaved a sigh of relief but got agitated soon after. He had even forgotten about the two terrifying ghostly cultivators who were chasing behind him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If you have the guts, come over!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu roared out loud. At this point, he could see a furnace at the bottom that glowed with a dimmer shade of gold. The dense color resembled flowing molten metal, and the flames spewing from it resonated and reverberated out. This was the core of the entire Ravaging Ghost Volcano! The Ravaging Ghost Volcano spanned over thousands of miles, and all the lava had originated from this place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu could feel his blood boiling as he charged into the rarely seen Blazing Sun Furnace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">RUMBLE!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the dull gold lava got into contact with his skin, Wu Yu instantly felt like his body was on fire. He couldn't hold back the pain and screamed out loud. The difference was stark. The moment he entered, his body was torched black. The terrifying heat even penetrated into his physical body, resulting his inner body being burnt to toast and vaporizing!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Screams of pain reverberated constantly from the bottom of Cangxue Qingfeng's feet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cangxue Qingfeng formed a golden sphere around her and tried to close the distance between her and the furnace. However, she couldn't last long. She was drenched in perspiration. Her human body was exceptionally alluring from the reflection of her perspiration, while her lion body was shimmering in dazzling flames. This created an exceptional contrast.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was that her body hosted both male and female parts. No one could really definitively determine her gender.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cangxue Qingfeng felt miserable. However, she broke into laughter upon hearing Wu Yu. "Black Fiend, that Wu Yu must be a fool to be trying to lure us to a battleground he excels in. However, he has overestimated himself and will likely lose his life here."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What!?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Fiend was just halfway into the Treasured Moon Furnace. He was completely drenched and looked pale at this point as he struggled to withstand the surrounding golden lava. As the golden lava crept onto the black sphere he had created to protect himself. It could be seen that he was in a perilous situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu has dived into a place that even I don't dare to go. He's screaming in pain now and will likely not last long." Cangxue Qingfeng chuckled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is going to be troublesome. If his corpse is reduced to dust, we wouldn't be able to get his legacy!" The Black Fiend didn't dare to dive deeper, as he was wary of facing the same fate as Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It is indeed as such. Now we can only wait and see if this brat dares to surface. Let's open a path for him and let him out." As Cangxue Qingfeng spoke, she moved beside the Black Fiend and the two of them looked below them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Wu Yu still had some strength in him, he should be rushing up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Fiend was feeling a little bottled up as he remarked with melancholy, "Why isn't there any commotion? Has he been burnt to death?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cangxue Qingfeng was about to nod her head when she vaguely heard a faint voice from below. "It's not that easy to kill me! If the two of you have the guts to come down, I'll fight with both of you at the same time!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cangxue Qingfeng exchanged glances with the Black Fiend. Seeing that the other party wasn't dead, they felt a little relieved. Otherwise, they would have gained nothing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, they had the time to play along with Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As such, the Black Fiend said, "Stop acting tough. You can probably only last a while longer below."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, he moved up a little with Cangxue Qingfeng and left enough space for Wu Yu to move should he come up. Since they were here, they naturally would want to kill Wu Yu with their own hands and gain something from it rather than seeing him being burnt to death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu smiled and answered, "Alright, let's see who can last longer!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Keeping the two of them here was his motive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While in the incomparably hot Subterranean Blazing Sun Furnace, Wu Yu couldn't release his doppelgangers, as they would be reduced to dust the moment they appeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After succeeding in keeping them here, Wu Yu acclimatized quickly in the extreme heat while arguing and observing them. After getting a sense of the size of the Subterranean Blazing Sun Furnace, he noticed that he was still in a rather exterior region. Therefore, he was able to withstand the heat after short periods of burns.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This might very well be the only one in the divine continent. You are really lucky to have found this place."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The third tier of the Invincible Vajra Body could be separated into two finer levels. Wu Yu had to reach the Nanwu Blazing Sun Golden Vajra Body to be considered as achieving great mastery. With the vast and scorching Blazing Sun Furnace below his feet, Wu Yu finally possessed the opportunity and condition of achieving great mastery of the third tier of the Invincible Vajra Body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the difficulty wasn't much different from the first time he fell into the Subterranean Treasured Moon Furnace. At this moment, the dull golden lava was just like a sharp spike piercing throughout his body as it raged brutally within his blood. Wu Yu constantly moved within the region to relieve the pressure he felt by the movements of the body. What he was striving for was the slow burn of his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After successfully withstanding the heat, he started devouring the dull gold lava using the spiritual art of the third tier of the Invincible Vajra Body. He wasn't just using his mouth to devour. In addition, he was using his ears, nose, and even the pores of his skin to hone and refine his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The very first time he devoured, Wu Yu screamed out pitifully. At that instant, he felt as though the inner organs of his body were being reduced to dust. It was the feeling a mortal would feel when he devoured flames. To put it simply, he felt drained. Moreover, every single inch of his body could feel the pain that resembled being sliced by knives coded with spice. That pain could knock anyone unconscious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rumble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his mind, a buzzing sound reverberated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Above him, Cangxue Qingfeng and the Black Fiend seemed to have heard it too. The two exchanged glances and smiled. The Black Fiend said, "Wu Yu, why are you so insistent? Come out now and we will grant you a quick death."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"As you have said, this is your territory. We can't dive any deeper, so why are you torturing yourself below?" asked Cangxue Qingfeng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If you have the balls, just come down. Otherwise, stop nagging there," Wu Yu responded loudly while screaming in pain. After shouting out, he felt a little better.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What a stubborn guy."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I have heard about that too."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"In that case, let's see how long you can last before being reduced to dust."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu no longer paid attention to them. Currently, his entire focus was on refining and honing the Nanwu Blazing Sun Golden Vajra Body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The day he succeeded would also be the day both of them would die!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For this mission, Wu Yu would have reaped handsome rewards if he slew three fourth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivators! Even if he didn't collect the 150,000 merits, it wouldn't matter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Persevere!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While forging the Invincible Vajra Body, the only way forward was to persevere.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, one couldn't just do so for a short while. Instead, he had to persevere at maximum intensity over a long period of time!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the very beginning, honing the Invincible Vajra Body was never going to be easy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the effects of it were incomparably immense! If not for the Invincible Vajra Body, Wu Yu would have died several times over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While devouring the dull golden lava and forging his body, every second and every breath brought unimaginable pain and misery.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While burning, Wu Yu looked towards the sky from the depths of the sea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"To become an immortal, one has to be thoroughly refined!"&nbsp;</span></p>
