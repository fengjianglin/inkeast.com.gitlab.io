 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was the only one left from the initial six.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Wu Yu defeated Ji Lingshuang, he didn't stay to listen to her. Now he was resisting wave after wave of the hellish and tumbling golden lava.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wei had used the World Obliterating Furnace on numerous opponents. However, she realized that the effects were the worse against Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The effects had barely restricted Wu Yu by 30%. Moreover, after such a prolonged period of burning, the damage to Wu Yu was insignificant!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiu Ying was burned for as long as Wu Yu and even his scale armor was almost burned through.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Wu Yu's flesh was simply appearing a little more flushed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, his attention landed on the endless and boundaryless sea of golden lava!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Weng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu lifted the Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean and disappeared before the eyes of Ji Lingshuang. He had charged upwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Young and brazen! However, he does have the capacity to do so. Perhaps I was too arrogant and therefore felt indignant when losing to someone of my age. However, I have to admit that Wu Yu has a good character and clearly knows what's right and wrong."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having a change in thought, although Ji Lingshuang was defeated, she felt much better and no longer felt as much hatred. However, her defeat in the hands of Wu Yu had prompted her to set the goal of exceeding Wu Yu in the future.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Wu Yu was silent and emotionless. Breaking through wave after wave of golden lava, he swung his Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean savagely to decimate the numerous magma rocks that dared to obstruct his way. As a result, the entire World Obliterating Furnace shook violently.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wei had felt his outburst from the very beginning as she controlled the World Obliterating Furnace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was right where the tip of the World Obliterating Furnace was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The World Obliterating Furnace was silent previously and the crowd thought that Nangong Wei working together with Ji Lingshuang would stand a chance. The more time passed, more confident they got. However, at this very moment, the World Obliterating Furnace appeared to have exploded from within. It was as though a huge beast had awakened and started its rampage. The entire World Obliterating Furnace was shaking furiously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the expression on the immortal beast phoenix turning more and more solemn, the crowd knew very well that Wu Yu had most likely defeated Ji Lingshuang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Wu Yu could already seen the top of the World Obliterating Furnace. There were all kinds of spirit designs over it, and they were circulating rapidly under the propulsion of Nangong Wei through her Violet Kingdom Primordial Energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The symbols shifted rapidly, spewing endless scorching flames towards Wu Yu. Within the scorching flames, other forms of power also swept towards Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Outside the World Obliterating Furnace, the immortal beast phoenix exerted all her strength to stop and attack Wu Yu. For her, this might be the most critical moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wu Yu still didn't just give in to her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Violent Art!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he was charging towards the top of the World Obliterating Furnace like a razor-sharp sword, all the muscles on his body bulked up. The Violent Art enabled him to gain exponential strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, his rampant and savage will reached a whole new level!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Grand Sea Overturning Flame Design!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This strike slammed towards the sky!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu triggered the spirit design on the mystical dragon's reverse scale. Instantly, it was as though he was holding onto a dragon. A deafening dragon roar reverberated across as he ripped apart all the lava with the mystical dragon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The next instant, he appeared at the top of the World Obliterating Furnace. With the strength of 10,000 men, he twisted his torso and swung his weapon towards the sky. Two different dao treasures clashed heavily at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Weng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Muffled sound waves reverberated throughout the entire World Obliterating Furnace, almost resulted in Ji Lingshuang losing her hearing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was within the World Obliterating Furnace initially. At this very moment, after the violent tremors, the golden lava separated from her body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She stood on the ground, she lifted her head and saw the giant World Obliterating Furnace being smashed into the sky. If Nangong Wei had not controlled it towards the end, it would very likely have smashed into Di Yi's Warship.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The phoenix flapped her wings up high in the sky, immersed in flames of nine colors!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cracks had even started to spread over her World Obliterating Furnace!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although that could be restored, it would unlikely be serviceable in the near future. Wu Yu's heavy strike had taken out her dao treasure temporarily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now Wu Yu held on to the Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean with a single hand as he leapt off from the ground. His eyes were burning like scorching flames, and golden flames erupted from all parts of his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He rose to stand face to face with Nangong Wei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A phoenix being knocked back couldn't be considered as losing. When she was locked down by Wu Yu, perhaps she felt a little fear in her heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regardless, she naturally wouldn't give up. She incited scorching flames of nine colors and flew up high into the sky before diving down!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You are too slow!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Using the Swift Art, Wu Yu arrived before her in an instant. Looking at the young girl before him, perhaps he had calmed himself substantially. All the anger and rage in him were mostly dispelled when he swung out with that strike that broke the World Obliterating Furnace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After speaking, the Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean landed on her back. Wu Yu didn't use much force but still sent Nangong Wei smashing onto the ground. The giant phoenix raised towering dust clouds when she hit the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, Wu Yu appeared above Nangong Wei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having taken the strike from Wu Yu, Nangong Wei suddenly realized that she was just like a fragile little bird before Wu Yu. In fact, she didn't even have the strength to maintain her immortal beast form, so she reverted back into human form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Standing on the ground blankly and feeling a little lost, she looked at Wu Yu with a tinge of fear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battle had ended.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had also exhausted great strength. He reverted to his human form, put away the Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean, and descended before Nangong Wei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been a long time since he had stood face to face with her and faced the dilemma before them together.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Stubbornness was still gleaming in her eyes. In addition, disgust for him could be seen, and other uncertain emotions were mixed within.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although it might seem that they were no different from before, everything had changed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had gradually calmed down as the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial came to an end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was in grave misery while being tortured by the demon in his heart that arose from the death of the Yan Huang City Lord. Now, the fight had given him some time to think through numerous things.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The death of the Yan Huang City Lord no longer seemed to be an insurmountable obstacle in his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Life and death were predetermined.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang City Lord couldn't avoid it, but Wu Yu had not given up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before the survival of the divine continent and his great dao, he found Nangong Wei's mentality to be very childish. She had lots of extreme views and was impulsive. She was just like a rebellious girl. The moment she started hating something, she would never let it go.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You must be feeling impressive. Do you think the world will bow down to you? Do you think that no one can ever compete with you and the future is yours to rule? There's no point in speaking of others. All I'm going to say now is just you wait. Things aren't over between us. I'll have revenge for Beishan Mo. Perhaps these words are boisterous. However, there will be a day that I'll defeat you! Wu Yu! I'll definitely defeat you!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was really stubborn.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, she appeared to be rather frenzied when she spoke. A strong and intense resolve gleamed in her eyes. Wu Yu was familiar with this look. This was just like him. It was intense and unyielding. Once she made up her mind on something, she would never change it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, she was actually the same kind of person as Wu Yu. Both of them were like raging flames. It was also because of this that when they got closer together, they would torch the other party.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu pursed his lips. Sometimes, he felt like he was more of an older brother when standing before Nangong Wei, just like how she once called him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had witnessed her growth. In her formative years, she had followed him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With things developing as they were, one could say that it was fate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If there weren't as many mishaps, they might have entered the Immortal Pair Hall. Perhaps they would have been a dao couple by now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright! I shall wait and see! To see what level you can reach. Now that you have become a phoenix, you have a bright future ahead. Be sure to make the best use of this talent and don't let me look down on you."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What could Wu Yu do for her?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had finally found a way.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rather than seeing her dispirited and never getting back on her feet after this blow, he might as well let her make him her target.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the very least, she would be moving ahead. Wu Yu's goal was to become an immortal. If her goal was on him, perhaps there might be a day that she would embark on this path.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Strength wouldn't bring any cons to her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since he had already disappointed her, to the very best of his ability, he wanted to help her at least become a powerful individual so she could continue moving ahead and grow regardless of the circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wei was infuriated upon hearing Wu Yu. She felt that Wu Yu was haughty and was making fun of her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The desire to retaliate grew even stronger in her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Since you are waiting to see this sight, you better open your eyes! There will be a day that I won't even grant you the opportunity to beg for mercy! Wu Yu! Just you wait!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dense flames spewed out from her eyes. After she finished her words, she turned around and went decisively towards where the Shushan Immortal Sect was located without even turning back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Nangong Wei left, the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial finally came to an end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, Ji Lingshuang had also returned to the side of the Taixu Sage Master. Truthfully speaking, she wasn't convinced either. The brazen attitude of Wu Yu was truly infuriating.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Seeing him as the goal is a great thing!" the Taixu Sage Master mumbled to himself, with the intention for Ji Lingshuang to overhear him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, he stepped forward. With a motivating voice, he announced loudly, "Now! Everyone must have seen clearly that Wu Yu didn't clinch the champion by defeating three opponents separately. Instead, he faced the siege of six people, emerged unscathed, and defeated everyone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Therefore, he's undoubtedly the champion for this Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial! I believe no one will object to this! If no one has any objections, let us cheer for the future of our divine continent!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wasn't just telling the crowd. He was also telling the entire divine continent that the future would belong to Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu looked around him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had truly become the core of the divine continent. The time where he destroyed Emperor Yan's Hall could even have been attributed to a freak combination of luck and bravery, and despite being an achievement, it left space for doubt. However, this victory was clinched based on his strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the eyes of the crowd and for the upcoming decades, the divine continent would enter a new era, one which belonged solely to Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Blood Dragon of Mount Wu, Jiu Ying, Ji Lingshuang, Nangong Wei, Gusu Yudie, and others could only serve as complimentary pieces before Wu Yu!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had risen from being a mortal and had now clinched the position of number one in the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial. Undoubtedly, his name would go down in history.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, what Wu Yu received right now were the cheers from the entire divine continent! At this very moment, he had reached the very peak of the divine continent!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This feeling was amazing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"City Lord, you must have wanted to see me reach the position where I stand today. The only shame is that you can no longer see."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu knew clearly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial came to an end, the Taigu Immortal Path was what mattered!&nbsp;</span></p>
