 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu followed the five of them into the fourth level of the Dao Querying Pagoda. The five turned back at the center and spread out, surrounding Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked at them. Three men and two women. All were core disciples at the third tier of the Qi Condensation Realm. Each of their abilities were in no way inferior to Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian's.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spiritual sources at their Chest Meridians, Heaven's Hall Meridians, and Heaven's Gate Meridians had already been activated. They had cultivated the Qi Condensation Spiritual Art and had fairly vigorous spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This class of disciple was considered elite disciples within the whole Heavenly Sword Sect. In a few decades, they would be the solid cornerstones of the Heavenly Sword Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, their attitude towards Wu Yu was hostile. As if there was resentment and jealousy in their bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The guy in the lead was built like a wall. He was a crane in a flock of chickens. He wore a robe of white gold, and his firm muscles filled the robe well. In his hand he wielded a huge, golden sword that drew the eye. The huge sword's tip rested on the ground. The blade was four feet long and as wide as the palm of one's hand. It sparkled with golden light and looked extremely intimidating!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's gaze swept out over them. Just from their auras, weaponry, and dress, he could guess their fortes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was believed that there were five affinities in nature, and humans followed this as well. Take Wu Yu as an example. Within the five affinities, his metal and fire were outstanding, while his water affinity was weak. That resulted in his intense and straightforward character. And the sturdily built man opposite him was much the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were other elements that came out of the five affinities, such as fog, wind, or lightning. Some were even completely discrete from the five affinities. It was almost inconceivable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The five of them being grouped together could be no coincidence. They must have had some sort of plan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first woman was tall and thin. She held a wooden sword that was definitely an immortal treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The delicate woman held a sword that flowed like water and could change its shape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then there were two guys. One was as fat as a mountain, and he looked even heavier than the leader. The other was extremely gaunt. His long hair was wispy, like a flame burning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">None of them spoke a word. They stood at the positions of the five affinities, with Wu Yu surrounded in the center. From the looks in their eyes, they were all thinking of bullying Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, we give you one last chance to reconsider. The five of us have the Five Affinities Sword Formation, which has even beaten those of the fourth tier of the Qi Condensation Realm! It's difficult even for those of the fourth tier to best us. And given your capabilities and status, if we accidentally injure you, we will be reprimanded by the elders. If you're frightened, then scram right now," the leader said in a stern voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Very well!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were the reason why Wu Yu had come today!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In order to obtain the best dao technique, one would have to face such a caliber of challenge. Wu Yu could feel their power. To a former battle fanatic like himself, this was exactly the challenge he was hoping for!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The opponents in the previous three levels were not even worthy to take a blow from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ping!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dark gold Demon Subduing Staff was planted on the ground, sending flames up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sword Sect disciples were often affiliated to dao techniques of the sword, and these five were no exception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hmph!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They laughed coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brothers and sisters, let us test the capabilities of the Sect Leader's personal disciple!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I hope you do not shame the Sect Leader."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Perhaps we might become the disciples of the Sect Leader as well."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they spoke, their longswords were already pointing at Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"They seem to have some sort of coordinated attack. I definitely cannot allow them to surround me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had fought military battles before and was familiar with the utility of battle formations. Once he fell into their design, he would be like a turtle in a jar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a fight where the odds were against his favor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Break!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, before his opponents made their move, he moved first. The Demon Subduing Staff in his hand sketched a golden trace in the air. It exploded with a ringing sound!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Heaven-Defying Dragon Slayer!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because he had no dao techniques, he could only use a supreme-grade martial art. The Heaven-Defying Dragon Slayer pierced through like a sword. It had only one target: the swordswoman whose affinity was wood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They called themselves the Five Affinities Fencers. In that case, he would send his greetings to the Fencer of Wood!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In single combat, none of them were Wu Yu's match.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Wu Yu moved, the burly Fencer of Gold cried out, "Don't let him get away!" His huge, golden sword cleaved down, and it was like a mountain falling down. And the Fencer of Wood executed some footwork. All five moved at the same time, and the Five Affinities Sword Formation immediately sprung into action. All five had been trained as a cohesive body for many years, and Wu Yu's attack on the Fencer of Wood disappeared as though it had sunk in a swamp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Attack!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All five speedily whirled around Wu Yu, switching positions. The five immortal treasure swords were like five demon snakes that lunged for Wu Yu at the same time, trying to take a bite out of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"So this is a personal disciple of the Sect Leader? He's nothing much!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite Wu Yu's ferocious defense, he had still sustained a score of deep cuts after a fierce clash. And the Fencer of Water laughed strangely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Not even a tenth of Big Brother." The Fencer of Fire laughed cruelly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's face was solemn. He thought as he defended,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"They have trained this Five Affinities Sword Formation for many years to make it a cohesive unit. With the power of all five, they are fairly equal to someone at the fourth tier of the Qi Condensation Realm. Very impressive...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was not that familiar with sword formations. Actually, they were one of the subtypes of spirit design, belonging under the Offensive Spirit Design. But the real Offensive Spirit Design was naturally all-powerful, whereas the Five Affinities Sword Formation that they employed had been simplified many times over. It was a pale imitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, just the form alone was difficult enough to deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spirit design was still far from Wu Yu. He did not dare to dwell on it for long. Now, all he could do was focus on reaching for a dao technique that would truly be his own!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Break!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Staff to Ascension connected with the Fencer of Gold, causing his arm to go numb. Wu Yu took the chance to take a breather while the head of the tiger was bleeding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But at this time, they came again, their attack as fierce as a tempest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The complex dao techniques opened Wu Yu's mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to the dao techniques of the Zhongyuan Dao Sect, the Heavenly Sword Sect's dao techniques needed close combat to be employed. And many relied on longsword immortal treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Mountain Splitter Art!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blinding, golden light. The Fencer of Gold cleaved down as though Wu Yu was the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Smoky Ripples!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mist thickened, hiding a glint of cold light. It was a sword tip!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Fire Bind!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sword changed into a fiery rope that snared Wu Yu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The various dao techniques complemented each other seamlessly. Although it was not as overwhelming as Heavenly Immortal Hao Tian's Fire Tornado Skill, they were even more deadly when combined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over the course of their battle, Wu Yu's body had already sustained many wounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Spiritual power-based dao techniques are indeed difficult to deal with. Although I have the first tier of the Invincible Vajra Body, it cannot hold out against such abuse forever!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Unless I make my Invincible Vajra Body even stronger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"A pity that Ming Long will not give me the second tier of Invincible Vajra Body."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In response to Ming Long's terms, Wu Yu had been prudent. By nature, he was unwilling to owe others too much. And he was not even certain that he could pay what he already owed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If I had the second tier of the Invincible Vajra Body completed, I could not only go and contest for more Spirit Concentration Pills to directly condense my qi, but I would also be invulnerable to the attack today, and not be pressed this hard!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Five Affinities Sword Formation was too powerful. Although Wu Yu's body had powerful recovery ability, it could not withstand such an onslaught of dao techniques!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This made Wu Yu feel his own inadequacy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Fixed Body Art cannot be used frequently. Firstly, it needs consistent training. And secondly, it should be used as a last resort lifesaver that few know about!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was basically like a forbidden dao technique. It was best not to use it unless the situation was dire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I can only rely on myself now!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking thus, he decided to fight it out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Immortal Ape Transformation!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before the eyes of the Five Affinities Fencers, Wu Yu suddenly expanded, immediately becoming the enormous, golden ape, replete with golden fur, glowing eyes, and the sauvastika on his back. He struck fear and awe in their hearts!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Immortal Ape Transformation did not increase his spiritual power, but his physical ability, strength, defenses, and speed had all been boosted!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More importantly, was the threat it represented. To these five, Wu Yu's present form looked like a savage beast, violence incarnate and numbing their own voice of reason!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"A Staff to Ascension!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu only aimed for the Fencer of Gold, ignoring the other dao techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He's mad! Finish him!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Fencer of Gold clashed directly with Wu Yu, and his golden sword was thrown from his hand. His whole arm had almost been broken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other four rained all kinds of dao techniques on Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before the transformation, Wu Yu could only grimly resist while the Fencer of Gold quickly recovered and rejoined the fray. But not this time. As though demented, Wu Yu rushed past all their dao technique attacks, tanking through it. The Demon Subduing Staff swept out, crashing against the skull of the Fencer of Gold. With a grunt, he fainted!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu whirled violently. The other four retreated three steps out of fear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu’s current form made him look like a golden god of war.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had been stabbed by two immortal treasure longswords, and now the wounds were actually closing before their very eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Argh!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This scene caused all four to retreat another panicked step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Come on then!" Wu Yu's burning eyes swept out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Kill!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were not completely unnerved. All four exchanged looks, then attacked as one. But at this time, their Five Affinities Sword Formation had been broken, and its power was significantly diminished. The four of them were not Wu Yu's match. In less than 10 breaths of time, the four were lying on the ground, wailing and howling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You've lost."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu stabilized his own rational side and reverted to ordinary human form. He donned another set of clothing and then put the Demon Subduing Staff on his back. He then walked past the five.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The remaining four that were conscious looked at him, trembling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They suddenly understood that one did not only need exceptional talent in order to become the personal disciple of the Sect Leader. In terms of will, one must also be above the rest!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They crawled aside and looked at Wu Yu with respect. The heroic will he had displayed was now completely concealed again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Wu Yu was the fourth level of the Scripture Holding Depository.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The first dao technique that belongs to me, Wu Yu! I'm coming!"</span></p>
