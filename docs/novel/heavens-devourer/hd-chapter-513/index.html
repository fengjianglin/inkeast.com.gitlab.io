 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Yan Huang Ancient Region experts are stronger than you guys? Stronger by how much? How are they compared to Luo Pin?" Wu Yu could not resist asking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not have any inkling of the strength of those stronger than the Yan Huang City Lord.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Huang City Lord could not help but laugh and say, "The Yan Huang Ancient Region is the core of the mortal world. Since ancient times, there have been countless extremely talented people, and they left behind countless true legacies. They had more spiritual qi, better treasures, countless cultivation resources, immortal treasures, dao treasures, immortal essences, and immortal medicines. Even the spirit designs that they passed down are better than those of the divine continent by a few folds. While we may be strong in the divine continent, we are nothing at the Yan Huang Ancient Region. Compared to the strong there, we are too far behind. We can at most be martial cultivators that will not be easily bullied."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Yan Huang Ancient Region was the capital, then the Dong Sheng Divine Continent would be a rural village.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Wu Yu still confused, the Yan Huang City Lord told him in detail, "The level I am now at is the fourth tier of the Primordial Spirit Transformation Realm. My younger brother is in the third tier. The Dubhe Sword Immortal is also at the third tier. The Merak Sword Immortal and Ursae Sword Immortal are at the second tier. Mizar, Alioth, Alkaid, and the others are at the first tier of the Primordial Spirit Transformation Realm. There are not more than 30 who can reach the Primordial Spirit Realm in the divine continent. If one does not break through the Primordial Spirit Transformation realm, there is basically no hope for him to become immortal. But at the Yan Huang Ancient Region, many have broken through the Primordial Spirit Transformation Realm and reached the Three Disasters, Dao Contemplation Realm."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Three Disasters, Dao Contemplation Realm was the highest cultivation level known to them, and it was said that one would have to survive three heaven and earth disasters, known as the Heaven's Wrath, to reach it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Also, to successfully attain dao, one would have to possess a complete dao! It was only then that one could pass the great trial, gain immortality, and truly become immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That immortal beast Luo Pin at full strength should be at the Three Disasters, Dao Contemplation Realm. I'm not sure how she was injured. To be able to incur the Heaven's Wrath, she must at least be above the third tier of the Dao Contemplation Realm. Such ability is also top notch in the Yan Huang Ancient Region. I believe that she is someone famous in the Yan Huang Ancient Region. It is just that the divine continent is now closed up to information from outside. We know too few strong cultivators. In the beginning, I also judged her strength wrongly."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang City Lord's explanation provided Wu Yu a certain level of understanding of their levels and abilities.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The difference between the Dong Sheng Divine Continent and the Yan Huang Ancient Region was also very clear. The Yan Huang Ancient Region had countless strong cultivators at the Dao Contemplation Realm, and they were all pursuing the Immortal Dao. Whereas the Yan Huang City Lord could not reach the Dao Contemplation Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was unexpected that Luo Pin was really that strong. She had not told Wu Yu her identity. Obviously, her status in the mystical dragon race was not low.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The difference between the Dong Sheng Divine Continent and the Yan Huang Ancient Region was not just the difference between 16 and one. For instance, those as strong as the Yan Huang City Lord were probably the norm at the Yan Huang Ancient Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was now at the third tier of the Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea. If he wanted to become immortal, he would have to reach the Primordial Spirit Transformation Realm first, then break through again and reach the Three Disasters, Dao Contemplation Realm. He knew that even if he had the chance, he would require a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the Yan Huang Ancient Region, Wu Yu finally understood and confirmed his goal. Thinking about it carefully, based on his current ability, if he went to that Yan Huang Ancient Region, he would probably only barely be able to fend for himself. It was definitely impossible for him to enjoy the same level of fame and respect he had received in the Dong Sheng Divine Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After saying this, the Yan Huang City Lord laughed and said, "Actually, there is one thing that you did not think of. Our Yan Huang Imperial City is affiliated with the Yan Huang Ancient Region. In other words, we exist because of the Yan Huang Ancient Region."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was confused. But one was the Yan Huang Ancient Region and the other was the Yan Huang Imperial City. Even without much thought, one could also see that the two were related!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"At the Yan Huang Ancient Region, there is a top-notch power in the central position, occupying three continents, called the Yan Huang Ancient Country! The people in Yan Huang Imperial City belong to the Yan Huang Ancient Country. After the immortals sealed the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord, they built this city in the Dong Sheng Divine Continent to guard him. In other words, the ancestors of our Yan Huang Imperial City came from the Yan Huang Ancient Region. This city was built by the Yan Huang Ancient Country, and even today, it still belongs to them. The relationship between Yan Huang Imperial City and the Yan Huang Ancient Country is similar to the relationship between the Heavenly Sword Sect that you have joined before and the Shushan Immortal Sect."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu did not expect that such a relationship still existed despite the years!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Besides, the Yan Huang Ancient Country knows that they have a base and thus left legacies in the Dong Sheng Divine Continent. Hence, even though Dong Sheng Divine Continent is far, they actually treat this place as their fourth continent. Except this is the land of the sealed evil lord and too much time has passed. So no one is willing to come over."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yan Huang Ancient Country? This top-notch power is a country?" Wu Yu asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were 3,000 mortal kingdoms in Divine Continent. To Wu Yu, organisations such as countries were built by mortals. After becoming martial cultivators, there would no longer be low-grade organisations such as countries. On the other hand, sects would be the majority. The most classic was the Shushan Immortal Sect and the Shangyuan Dao Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sects were, of course, more suitable for martial cultivation. Hence, in Wu Yu's heart, countries were ranked really low, while immortal sects were way above. Even Yan Huang Imperial City was very sect-like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">3,000 mortal kingdoms added up could not compare to a second-rate sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countries were built by mortals. For instance, Dong Yue Wu. Wu Yu knew too clearly of Dong Yue Wu's governance and rule. Within the machine which was the country, an individual's physical power was not the symbol of the most powerful ruler.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For instance, Wu You need not be the strongest in Dong Yue Wu because her political power could limit military power. However, in a sect, the sect leader had to be the strongest, or he would not be able to establish his leadership.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang City Lord obviously knew what Wu Yu was confused about. He could not hold back his laughter and said, "You are still too young. It is normal not to know. The Yan Huang Ancient Country is an ancient power with a longer history than the Yan Huang Ancient Region. It was said that it existed even before the Yan Huang Ancient Region and has existed for at least 10 yuan worth of time. It also has at least 10 million years of documented history. It is said that at its peak, the entire Yan Huang Ancient Region was ruled by the Yan Huang Ancient Country. Even the name Yan Huang Ancient Region was named on behalf of the Yan Huang Ancient Country. Now they are left with three continents. This is also a result of the rise of other powers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Yan Huang Ancient Country is not on the same level as the mortal kingdoms. This is a Martial Cultivation Kingdom. Its scale is larger than you can imagine. You can see this Martial Cultivation Kingdom's initial form from the way Yan Huang Imperial City is structured. This is a militarized Martial Cultivation Kingdom.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The levels are tight, punishment and rewards are clear, and the discipline is strong! To rule the martial cultivators with a militaristic style! The greatest advantage is that management will be easier. Besides, if battle achievements determine ranking, then everyone has an opportunity to rise. As long as they achieve accomplishments, they will receive great returns. Under militarized management, the army of the Yan Huang Ancient Country has been, since ancient times, the most terrifying battle power. This is something that your usual sect could not do. After all, sects have loose management and most of them rely on the teacher-disciple relationship as the base. This is less efficient than militarized management. You were born in a mortal palace, and much of the same logic remains. If you get the opportunity to visit the Yan Huang Ancient Country, you will understand how domineering the spiritual will and battle power of a Martial Cultivation Kingdom can be!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, Wu Yu used to lead armies to war, so of course he knew the power of a military. In a situation where his soldiers had good physiques, they were definitely much better than rogue groups of martial artists.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A 100-person army with strict discipline and clear reward and punishment systems compared to a strong but loosely led group of martial artists, each with their own individual goals, Wu Yu could totally eliminate the other party.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The premise was that these soldiers listened to him and that he had enough power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing this, Wu Yu could not help but feel awe towards the Yan Huang Ancient Country! If that was true, then the Yan Huang Ancient Country would be too scary. Yan Huang Imperial City could only be a castle that they built on the outskirts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, the management of Yan Huang Imperial City was not strict at all. After all, the Yan Huang Immortal Army was by invitation. They did not have an overly strict punishment system. The Yan Huang Immortal Army was very free and could only be considered half-militarized.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whereas from the Yan Huang City Lord's words, the Yan Huang Ancient Country was totally militarized. It was highly possible that it would be almost the same as the mortal armies that Wu Yu used to manage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As mortals had limited battle power, they could explode with stronger offensive power when they gathered together. Thus, they had many moves that were used often. If he used such moves with this Martial Cultivation Army, then the effect would indeed be shocking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Actually, it was right of you to come to Yan Huang Imperial City from Shushan, as only I can give you the opportunity to join the top-notch power in the Yan Huang Ancient Region, the Yan Huang Ancient Country. Based on your personality and past experiences, I believe that you can have a bright future over there. After all, you are more familiar than others on what a country is and what an army is. The only difference is that the Yan Huang Ancient Country is larger and its army is stronger. In reality, it is basically the same." The Yan Huang City Lord thought very highly of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, Wu Yu had studied military books since young and was talented in leading armies to battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The only uncomfortable point is that in such an environment, those on top have absolute power and say. Once one goes against those orders, then, as your leader, he will have the authority to execute you." The Yan Huang City Lord was a little worried about this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu actually knew this better even better than him. There were also many ranks in the mortal army. There were indeed many punishment methods for the soldiers who disobeyed orders. If one was really difficult to manage and showed disrespect, Wu Yu had jailed such people directly before.</span></p>
