 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang City Lord smiled benignly and then retrieved a white egg, placing it in Wu Yu's palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His hand was as cold as ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After so many twists and turns, who would have thought that it would return to Wu Yu's possession.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang City Lord suddenly said soberly, "I heard them say that this is the body of the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord. It is empty inside, and will only hatch if the soul of a god enters it. Since they said that the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord is a soul, and can escape from the imprisonment of the Heaven Devouring Evil Residence, then he will probably search frantically for this egg in order to rebirth. That is why this egg definitely cannot fall into his hands. If needed, it can be passed on to the experts of the Yan Huang Ancient Country."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So that was it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So this was the true identity of the egg.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back then, the Ghostly Emperor's goal had not just been the egg, but also the soul of the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord within the Heaven Devouring Evil Residence. That was why he had been lying when he said that he would take the egg and leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, he had to be stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Perhaps tossing it at the Taigu Immortal Path, where the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord temporarily cannot go to, would be a good choice as well. After all, there is a certain degree of difficulty in going to the Yan Huang Ancient Region."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because one had to snatch the Taigu Immortal Talisman of others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Understood."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu nodded. No matter what, this could not be allowed to fall into the hands of the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord. Before, it had not been safe in Wu Yu's hands, but he was going to the Taigu Immortal Path, so it would undoubtedly be safest in his possession.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he handed over the egg, the Yan Huang City Lord's hand drooped weakly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not have much strength left. Holding out until now was simply because he had many things that he had yet to explain. And now that all that had to be said was said, he directed his warm smile around, watching the reverent gazes directed his way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu still felt very sad. Even though the Yan Huang City Lord was casual about his own mortality, Wu Yu was not! He could not bear seeing this senior leaving him at this time. This feeling was just like when Uncle Sun had left him. Anger, hatred, agony. All of it coalesced in his chest, about to explode at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evidently, the Imperial General was in no better condition than Wu Yu. This burly, bulk of a man was currently on his knees before the Yan Huang City Lord as well, two rivers of hot tears streaming down his face, his fists clenched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All that had happened here was completed. The remaining two preparations, as well as the things to give to Wu Yu, all of that was done. The Yan Huang City Lord thought it over. There was nothing else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the proud stature of the Imperial General twisted in misery, he shook his head. "Brother, you're a seven-foot-tall man. Don't mope and weep about. From now on, all of Yan Huang Imperial City is entrusted to you. No matter what, Yan Huang Imperial City cannot fall."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yes!" the Imperial General choked out through gritted teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were words of farewell, and the Imperial General did not know what else to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And then the Yan Huang City Lord turned to the crowd again. "Brethren of the divine continent, things have come to pass this way. I can only pray that you are able to drive off the evil, escape this tremulous time, and cleanse the divine continent. This old creature will take his leave first. My apologies."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He faced his death staunchly, and this stoic attitude called the respect of all present. At this time, the Yan Huang City Lord must have reached a new pinnacle in terms of thought and spirit. A pity that his candle was already near its end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Wu Yu had prepared himself, when he looked up, he saw that the Yan Huang City Lord was sitting in the lotus position on the dais, even though his body was battered. A righteous position! And his gaze was smoldering. His eyes fell on the wall behind him, his look complex.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, he turned to the crowd, and said softly, "My friends, until fate brings us together again."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the last word, his body vanished with a light breeze, the ghost of his easy smile still lingering. A good man was gone with the wind, turned to ash, which had all fallen onto the round platform. As though a symbol of his will. Even though he was dead, he would stand guard outside the Heaven Devouring Evil Residence, not allowing any to enter!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang City Lord was truly gone!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter how prepared Wu Yu was, he was still thunderstruck at this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the dais, the thin layer of ash was the Yan Huang City Lord. His will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing this, Wu Yu felt a catch in his throat. Excruciating. Depressing. Not a word came out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire place was deathly silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial General had cultivated with his elder brother until today. A few centuries of time - no one but the two knew how deep their relationship ran. Seeing the Imperial General bow his head at this time, his wretched frame slumping without energy - it was apparent just how devastating and agonizing this was for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was devastated too. It was just like when Sun Wudao had passed. But this time was different. His hatred was directed against someone sealed in a different world, and he had no way to act immediately. And to defeat the ultimate enemy, killing the puppets of the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord was not enough!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Which meant that the one responsible for everything was the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was right below this round dais.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Where the Yan Huang City Lord guarded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's greatest memory was him sitting cross-legged on this round dais, a figure that did not move for decades at a time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, the Imperial General stood up. He circled the dais once, setting some spirit designs that would preserve the ashes of the Yan Huang City Lord on top of the platform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"From today onwards, unless I die, no one should dream of breaking into this place and entering."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was his vow, a promise that he had guaranteed the Yan Huang City Lord.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Taixu Sage Master sighed. "The dead is gone. Cease your sorrow. Di Yan deserves our respect, but we need to stand by his death wishes. 10 months is not that long. We have to think of a solution immediately. We need at least 80 percent certainty that when those two escape, we can kill them and avenge Di Yan. Firstly, the most important thing is spirit designs. I suggest that, with this wall as the core, we use these 10 months to fashion the strongest killing spirit designs of our major sects."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Spirit designs are a must. Besides that, no matter what kind of killing method, we must prepare them seamlessly, one after another. There can be no chance that they live. We must also put our strongest defensive spirit designs on this round dais," the Dubhe Sword Immortal said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were already pondering as to what spirit designs to fashion, and each was considering their own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Imperial General, what do you think?" The Taixu Sage Master saw that he was emotionally unstable, and therefore had to ask his opinion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial General's eyes were red. He answered wearily, "I cannot get a hold of myself right now. Don't ask me. Let me be for a few days. You lot arrange everything...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Never had such a struggling side of him been seen before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Taixu Sage Master nodded, saying, "Alright, then we will head out first. There has to be a conclusion at the Shangyuan Dao Sect, then we will arrange things here."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial General needed some alone time. He would not be mentally ready to immediately commence the preparations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the instructions of the Taixu Sage Master, everyone exited the City Lord Residence, and Wu Yu followed as well. Outside, many of the Yan Huang Imperial City disciples were waiting. They were all waiting for the Imperial General to come out. Faced with the queries of the 5,000 strong Yan Huang Immortal Army, Wu Yu could only bid them return first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu." The Taixu Sage Master shouted for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this crowd, Wu Yu was truly a special being.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sage Master."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was surrounding Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I entrust the matter of the Taigu Immortal Path to you," the Taixu Sage Master said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Mm."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, rage had accumulated in Wu Yu's chest, much like the Imperial General. Although it was not as serious, he didn't feel good either. At this moment, what he wanted to do most was take out the Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean and smash everything before him. Perhaps only such madness could ease the bitterness and gloominess of his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Everyone, follow me back to Shangyuan Dao Sect, then bring all your delegations back. And then bring out all who are at least at the eighth tier of the Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">realm, and gather at Yan Huang Imperial City. At the same time, if you have any resources, prepare them. We cannot announce this news at present, or there will be mass panic amongst the populace. Only eighth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivators and above can know the truth and participate in the preparations. What do you all think?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one had any thoughts on this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Faced with such a matter, everyone needed to calm down and think.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over at the demons’ side, the Taixu Sage Master said seriously, "This matter concerns the survival of the divine continent. The demons are no exception. That is why we need both of you to cooperate, and bring all your skills, plans, and methods to the table."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ying Huang said, "Cut the crap. We know what to do. This caliber of old demon is bigger than our petty squabbles."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And then the Taixu Sage Master turned to the Shushan Sword Immortals, especially the Mizar Sword Immortal. "In this matter, Nangong must control himself and think of the bigger picture. If we can pass this hurdle, then we can settle our personal enmities. Agreed?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To the Mizar Sword Immortal, this was cruel indeed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He found it hard to bear, and chose not to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Dubhe Sword Immortal answered in his stead. "Sage Master, do not worry. We know what to do."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Mizar Sword Immortal had been waiting for a very long time; he could wait another year or so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, the Alkaid Sword Immortal spoke up. "There is a small problem. If we cannot announce this matter publicly, then over at the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial, Wu Yu still has to win first place in order to go to the Taigu Immortal Path in a way that will convince the masses. Otherwise, it will be difficult to explain to so many. After all, the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial is no child's show."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was indeed logical.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this matter concerned all of them, then the remaining six contenders had nothing to say as well. After all, it was Wu Yu who bore the heavy responsibility of the divine continent's survival when he journeyed to the Taigu Immortal Path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it has to be said that there had to be some sort of explanation to the divine continent’s experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No matter. I will participate in the following battles." Just as everyone was stuck on this issue, Wu Yu stood up directly. Then it was easily settled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, they were also confident in Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Since that is the case, let us return to the Shangyuan Dao Sect."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After deciding, the entire group turned back towards the Shangyuan Dao Sect. They had come with urgent speed, but each left mellow and somber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Amongst them, only Wu Yu steadily grew more restless, his eyes turning wild as the hatred and fury in his heart continued to grow, until he felt like his being would explode.</span></p>
