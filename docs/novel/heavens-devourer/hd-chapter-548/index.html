 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now he couldn't think too deeply about why the door to the Taigu Immortal Path would appear here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like how it was hard for him to understand the emergence of a spiritual qi spring at this place before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Towards the end, Wu Yu looked towards the Taixu Sage Master, the Imperial General, and the Dubhe Sword Immortal and bade his farewell. "I'll be leaving."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Have a safe trip!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the three strongest human race experts seeing him off, Wu Yu didn't hesitate to jump right into it. His body soon contacted the talisman-like door of the Taigu Immortal Path. Upon contact, the light of alternating colors assimilated into his body. In the blink of an eye, Wu Yu was sucked into another world and disappeared from the sight of the crowd.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The gazes of the Taixu Sage Master and the rest were shaky but filled with hope. It was especially so for the Imperial General. Up until this point, his eyes were still filled with blood capillaries. When Wu Yu left and the door towards the Taigu Immortal Path disappeared, he gritted his teeth and said, "Wu Yu bears heavy responsibilities and we have pinned a certain level of hope on him. However, the preparations for the next eight months will be the most crucial. No matter what, Duomingshan Shengxue and Yu Fuyao of the Heavenly Seas have to die!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Malevolence gleamed in the eyes of the Taixu Sage Master. He said, "I have raised this sinful person to adulthood, and now he's bringing catastrophes to the world. If I don't kill him, I don't deserve to live!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They returned to Yan Huang Imperial City soon after, leaving Feng Xueya, who seemed worried, behind. Looking at that spiritual qi spring, he mumbled, "Everyone has a role to play before the impending disaster of the world. I wonder when my disciple will return after his departure today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"However, those with righteous hearts have always borne greater responsibilities with greater strength. Wu Yu is naturally no exception. Hopefully, he will only get stronger from these twists and turns."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wu Yu came into contact with the door to the Taigu Immortal Path, the first feeling he got was mystical. It was as though he had fallen into a pond and the energy within the talisman of the door had shrouded him. The energy was extremely warming.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything before his eyes turned blurry and he couldn't see anything clearly. The water flow around him pushed and sent Wu Yu in a certain direction. Moreover, it was getting faster and faster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This feeling is just like moving through worlds. The Jambu Realm is also the human realm. I wonder if the Taigu Immortal Path resides within the human realm, or perhaps it is beyond the human realm?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"From what this lady knows, it should be beyond the human realm but remains connected to it in various areas." Through Wu Yu's eyes, Ming Long was also seeing everything that was happening around Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Taigu Immortal Path is the most mystical place of the entire Jambu Realm. It is said that you will always end up in a different place even if you enter it 100 or 1,000 times. I'm pretty curious as to what you will encounter after you enter the place. Will you meet a fatal encounter, or will you end up in a place where treasures that could trigger riots in the human realm are waiting to be picked up?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We will know soon."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu knew that he was now really close to the Taigu Immortal Path.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, he suddenly felt like he was thrown off the flow of water. His vision was blurry initially, and even his Eyes of Fire and Gold couldn't see through the mystical elements. However, it got clearer gradually. The moment he felt the force of the water flow disappear, he knew immediately that he had arrived at the Taigu Immortal Path.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first thing Wu Yu noticed was the Taigu Immortal Talisman. The moment he entered the place, the talisman insignia that had surrounded him initially condensed into a talisman. All the insignias on the door towards the Taigu Immortal Talisman were now on the talisman. It was just that they had shrunk substantially. However, the effects and might not have weakened in the slightest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He obtained the Taigu Immortal Talisman that would send him back to the Dong Sheng Divine Continent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This would be the most crucial life-saving item he would have in this place. It was said that once obtained, everyone would carry it close to them. People would hide it in some parts of their bodies and ensure that they could trigger it instantaneously through their wills to escape from this place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it was placed within a Sumeru Pouch, it would be a little slower.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu stored the Taigu Immortal Talisman close to his body. Currently, he was already wearing the Battle God Armor of the Prime Heavenly Emperor. The Taigu Immortal Talisman was kept within the Battle God Armor. Obviously, the dao treasure armor was a little too attention-grabbing. As such, Wu Yu had transformed it to appear as an ordinary Yan Huang Immortal Armor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After putting the Taigu Immortal Talisman away, Wu Yu would then be considered as truly leaving the stream of water. His vision cleared up and the first thing he saw was a patch of starry sky. The next moment, he felt a strong suction force from below, and he was pulled towards it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This should be gravity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wu Yu finally reacted to it, his legs were already stepping on the ground. Even so, he still felt as though there was a mountain weighing on him, making it hard for him to even straighten his back, let alone takeoff on his sword and fly in the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn't just affecting his flight and feeling like a mountain weighing on him. In fact, this force was exerting on every corner of his body. Even strands of his hair were straightened from the gravitational pull.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The gravity here should be numerous times higher than that of the divine continent. Is this the mysterious part about the Taigu Immortal Path? In a place like this, the speed of a battle would be greatly restricted. It would be even harder to fight in the air on swords. I've managed to acclimatize so quickly because of my physical body. If it were the Blood Dragon of Mount Wu or others who came, they would likely be lying flat on the ground at this moment."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within a short instant, Wu Yu understood lots of things.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a place that ordinary people would find it hard to even walk around in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment he got in, he was severely tested. The Taigu Immortal Path was indeed not ordinary.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He observed his surroundings carefully.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He couldn't help but feel astounded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I... Am I standing on a planet?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn't land that was beneath his feet. From the curvature of the land, this wasn't a vast land that was similar to the Dong Sheng Divine Continent. Instead, it was a rather small sphere with an irregular exterior. The most likely explanation would be that this was a small planet in the cosmos. If not for the extreme gravity, Wu Yu estimated he would be able to make a round on the surface of the planet within an hour or so.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was actually standing on a planet?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The crucial thing was that the entire planet was made of metal without any soil. As for what metal it was, Wu Yu had no idea. Nonetheless, it was clear that it was a real treasure despite the fact that he couldn't see the spiritual marks. He attempted to use one of his supreme immortal treasures, the Grand Emperor Sword, to damage it, but he barely made a dent on the metal surface of the planet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now he was trapped on this incomparably tough, metal planet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lifting his head, surrounding the planet was the vast cosmos. Wu Yu couldn't see the edge at all. However, he could see several dozen oddly-shaped planets of similar sizes around him. There were definitely more in the distance. It was just that they were so far away that even his Eyes of Fire and Gold couldn't see clearly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among which, although the closest one to his metal planet was really far away, Wu Yu could see with his Eyes of Fire and Gold that there was another person on it!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were probably from the Yan Huang Ancient Region!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing others, Wu Yu got a little more agitated. He was thinking of whether he could charge to the other planet. Therefore, disregarding the strong gravity on the metal planet, he exerted all his strength and incited his Violet Kingdom Primordial Energy to charge upwards. Although the process was tenuous and it was hard for him to accelerate, he managed to get off the surface at the very least and was flying towards the cosmos of stars!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, Wu Yu collided into a wall, throwing his senses into disarray.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So there was a layer of spirit design around the surface of the metal planet. Wu Yu only noticed it when he crashed into it. It was a black and spherical spirit design that enveloped the metal planet. Clearly, the intention was to prevent Wu Yu from leaving.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wu Yu fell to the ground, the spirit design seemed to have disappeared. Wu Yu couldn't see it again despite using his Eyes of Fire and Gold.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The isolating force of the spirit design is really strong. I wonder if I can break through a spirit design like this if I exert all my strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Taigu Immortal Path is really a mysterious place.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he was thinking hard about how to escape from this planet to another planet with other people, he suddenly saw more than one person on the nearest planet. The other person was approaching the first person he saw previously!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"So there's two people!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was slightly shocked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"In that case, I might not be the only person on this planet. There might be people from the Yan Huang Ancient Region! I hope they are people from the Yan Huang Ancient Country."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he could find them on this planet, he wouldn't have to go to another planet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If there are others on my side, they might come looking for me after the commotion I just caused."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Taigu Immortal Path, any other person might pose a grave danger to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu shifted his position a little. However, he was also observing his initial location for any signs of other people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's really hard to even walk on this planet. My battle strength is greatly restricted here."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu finally moved to another place after a rather tedious walk. He observed his surroundings and realized that the surface of this planet wasn't regular at all. Although it wasn't big, there were natural structures made of metal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Human race?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Wu Yu heard a voice from behind him. He turned around and saw the source.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was a strange-looking guy wearing armor. However, the armor seemed to grow from his body. He had a huge stature, looked rather devilish, and had eyes filled with violence and unruliness. The most crucial thing was that intense and vast demonic aura surrounded his body. Also, it was different from the demonic aura of demons on the divine continent. It was filled with a type of... the scent of salt water.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without a doubt, this was a sea region demon!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Truth be told, Wu Yu had seen sea region demons while he was in the East Sea. It was just that those were just small fishes or shrimps that couldn't hold a candle to the sea region demon before him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn't just cultivation level and strength. It was also in terms of their powerful bloodline.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the Divine Continent Heavenly Dragon Trial, the Blood Dragon of Mount Wu was one of the most elite demons around. However, the first sea region demon he encountered after he entered the Taigu Immortal Path was stronger and had a higher cultivation level than the Blood Dragon of Mount Wu despite not having a bloodline as strong as that of the Blood Dragon of Mount Wu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, he even had a tinge of bloodline that belonged to mystical dragons.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sea region demon flicked his tongue, licked his lips, and asked, "Hey, brat, are you from the Yan Huang Ancient Country?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other party had mistaken him for someone from the Yan Huang Ancient Country at the very beginning. It would appear that his features in this aspect were prominent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then again, I couldn't care less. Don't blame me for going on a killing spree when a fourth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator dares to enter this place." The other party laughed coldly.&nbsp;</span></p>
