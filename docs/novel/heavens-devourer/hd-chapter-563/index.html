 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu did not expect the other party to be so open. The man laughed and said, "I'm being rude, sorry. I'm Lan Tianyu from the Azure Wings Hurricane Valley. The Azure Wings Hurricane Valley is too small, you probably have not heard of it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Indeed I have not. Where is it located?" Wu Yu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other party's enthusiasm made him a little uncomfortable. After all, he was always given the cold shoulder treatment here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Tianyu tilted his head and said, "It is at the north of the Nanshan Continent, near the Central Region Divine Continent. My Azure Wings Hurricane Valley does not belong to any country, but we have a long legacy. My father is the Valley Master and is quite powerful. Hence, we were not swallowed, and instead merged into neighbouring countries. Heh heh."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he heard “Central Region Divine Continent,” Wu Yu could only say that luck was on his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That place was near the Central Region Divine Continent. Perhaps once he exited that place, he could enter the Central Region Divine Continent and tell people what happened in the Dong Sheng Divine Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for how to handle Lan Tianyu's seniors, Wu Yu did not overthink it. He could pass the Taigu Immortal Talisman to the Dong Sheng Divine Continent to Lan Tianyu and let him wait there. This was a serious matter. If the leaders of the Azure Wings Hurricane Valley could understand the seriousness of this matter, then they might forgive Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides they might not be guarding the gateway to the Taigu Immortal Path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had heard that after crushing the Taigu Immortal Talisman, one might not return to the original position of the gateway to the Taigu Immortal Path. Some discrepancy was expected.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An eighth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator living near the Central Region Divine Continent. You could say that the smiling Lan Tianyu before him was his best choice now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was prepared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now his armor dao treasure was destroyed, so the other party could not guess that he was someone from the Yan Huang Ancient Country easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the other party said, "I see that you are quite pitiful to explore this place alone. How about you follow me? While I'm no genius, I have one or two life-saving tricks up my sleeve. The average ninth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator may not even be my match. It will be no problem protecting you a little. Oh, yes, you have yet to introduce yourself." The other party's words made Wu Yu cautious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He said that the average ninth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator was not his match. Obviously, he was no average eighth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator! He must have some ultimate skill, probably like the Blood Dragon of Mount Wu, who was also at the eighth tier but could defeat a ninth tier He Taijun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides, he had no ill intentions towards him and was also concerned about his safety. This was a rare kindness in the Taigu Immortal Path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Firstly, there was a risk in attacking him, and secondly, Wu Yu could not plot against someone who had treated him kindly. This made him guilty, and he quickly gave up the decision he had made at the start. After all, he still had some time and chances left. He need not make a move now. Additionally, it went against his principles to attack a person whom he just met and was chatting enthusiastically with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides, he had better ways.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since the other party was so honest, he was also honest and directly told the other party, "I'm not from the Yan Huang Ancient Region. I'm not sure if you have heard of the Dong Sheng Divine Continent, which sits outside the 19 continents, at the south of the Yan Huang Ancient Region."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other party was surprised and his eyes widened. He went closer to Wu Yu and asked, "Are you talking about the Demon Sealing Continent? The all-swallowing Evil Lord that was turning the Jambu Realm upside down, that forced the sky palace to send heavenly armies to destroy it and was ultimately sealed five yuan ago? The Heaven Devouring Evil Lord?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yes, that Heaven Devouring Evil Lord."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh, yes, the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord! I heard that the immortals used the Three Generations Yuan Deadly Formation and spent three yuan of time before they killed him! The reason why the Dong Sheng Divine Continent became even more rural is because they said that the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord died there and that his death affected luck."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the conversation turned to this, Lan Tianyu was very excited. Obviously, he was very interested in this legend. At this moment, he stood in front of Wu Yu and stared at him with wide eyes. He exclaimed and said, "I did not expect that I, Lan Tianyu, would have the chance to see people from the Dong Sheng Divine Continent. Are there gateways to the Taigu Immortal Path at the Dong Sheng Divine Continent too? How have I not heard of it?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There's only one gate." He was too enthusiastic. Actually, when Wu Yu explained to this stage, he had become very hopeful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Tianyu said, "Only one, no wonder I didn't know. There are no stories about that either. No wonder you are only a fourth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator and can arrive here. I heard that the Dong Sheng Divine Continent is now very rural and poor. Not to mention an immortal, in the past few hundreds of thousands of years, not even a Dao Querying Three Disasters Realm cultivator has emerged from there."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was the truth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was not going to talk about that. He looked serious and said, "I'm Wu Yu. Actually, other than training in the Taigu Immortal Path, I have an important mission that concerns the survival of divine continent. It is a mission that is very important to the Yan Huang Ancient Region as well. However, not many are willing to listen to me. I'm not sure if Brother Lan is willing to listen to my story?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You have a life or death mission? Quickly, tell me, I'm willing to listen!" Lan Tianyu was excited, but he was respectful towards Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu believed that when he told the story that he had told Jiang Qijun to Lan Tianyu, Lan Tianyu would help. After hearing Wu Yu's story, Lan Tianyu was shocked. His face was pale and he said, "You mean if no one goes over to help, then in about 10 months’ time, the people at your side will be unable to defeat the two Heaven Devouring Evil Lord puppets and then the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord will be reborn?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That’s right." Wu Yu was very touched. Lan Tianyu's reaction was practically the opposite of Jiang Qijun’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After getting confirmation from Wu Yu, Lan Tianyu became anxious, and he nervously asked, "This is not logical. You mean the immortals can make mistakes? They said that the Three Generations Yuan Deadly Formation would kill him. How did it not kill the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord? How is that old monster so hardy? No way, no matter whether this is true or not, I must tell my dad and let him spread the news."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's eyes reddened as he said, "If you can do that after you leave the Taigu Immortal Path, you, your dad, and the Azure Wings Hurricane Valley will accumulate many merits."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Tianyu was filled with suspicions about Wu Yu's story. But while Jiang Qijun was filled with disdain, Lan Tianyu felt that whether it was true or not, he would spread the news and tell his father just in case.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Tianyu pulled a long face and said, "Do I leave now? I think there's still some time and there is no need to be so anxious. The top-notch strong people will not take more than a month to reach the Dong Sheng Divine Continent. We still have time, I need to tell more people. Can I still spend some time here? After all, it was really not easy for me to enter the Taigu Immortal Path. My dad also spent a lot…."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, there was still time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was grateful that he even had the thought to leave the Taigu Immortal Path immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He clasped his hands respectfully and said seriously, "Please try your hardest to spread the news. Many thanks. I'm extremely grateful for your help. In the future, if you have anything that you need me for, I, Wu Yu, will definitely help." &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't be so serious. The survival of the world is the responsibility of all the martial cultivators," Lan Tianyu said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The best part was that between the two of them spreading the news, everyone in the Taigu Immortal Path would know about this and someone would eventually leave the Taigu Immortal Path and spread the news. Even if there would be something unexpected, someone out there would believe it and would be willing to go to the divine continent and take a look! After all, this was very important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If only you met me before the appearance of the Thunder Source Crystal Beast King. I would have let many people know about this. After that fight, over 100 people were forced to leave the Taigu Immortal Path. If they knew about this, perhaps they would have already spread it to the Yan Huang Ancient Region," Lan Tianyu said wistfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There were actually over 100 people who were forced to leave?" Wu Yu was nearby at that moment too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yes. I did not take part and hid far away. That's how I survived. Many Primordial Spirit Transformation Realm cultivators were forced away by the Thunder Source Crystal Beast King.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What happened in the end?" Wu Yu still wanted to know.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm not too sure too. It was too chaotic at that time. It seemed like the Thunder Source Crystal Beast King was killed, but I don't know who took that enormous Thunder Source Ancient Crystal. I asked around, but no one knew. Someone must have taken it and hidden it. After all, if that treasure were taken out, it would cause fights. The person who hid it must be very smart. It's a pity that from then onwards, the Thunder Source Crystal Beasts and Water Source Crystal Beasts in this sea seemed to have disappeared and have become hard to find. The people who stayed behind have been looking for more than 10 days, and there seems to be no movement at all. The key is that we seem to be trapped in this deep sea again, and we can't leave at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Of course, some people have already left, but most of them, like me, have become lost like headless flies."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the current situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Speaking of this, Lan Tianyu said, "I have to find someone quickly to let them spread this news. Do you want to join me, or should we split up? If we act separately, the efficiency will be higher. We can also avoid being defeated together if we encounter something. Then no one will be able to spread the news."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then let's split up." Wu Yu thought about it. If he stayed with him, he also could not forge the Invincible Vajra Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When someone like Lan Tianyu was helping him, he felt more relieved. If the mission assigned to him by the Yan Huang City Lord was 100%, he had already finished at least 50% of it. At least when Lan Tianyu exited this place, he would tell his father and others. Although he did not know what kind of reaction they would have, he believed that someone somewhere would be concerned about the apocalypse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Wu Yu wanted to achieve a 100% success rate!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He still had time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, here's my core-tail talisman. Feel free to contact me. You give me some of yours too."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although this core-tail talisman could not be used to transmit messages out of the Taigu Immortal Path, it could still be used to keep in contact with people in this sea within close proximity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu quickly exchanged core-tail talismans with him. Lan Tianyu was then at ease and hurried away. He could see that on this matter, Lan Tianyu would definitely do his best.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I met a good man." Wu Yu looked at Lan Tianyu as he left and could not help but sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Tianyu had some friends. He was probably contacting them now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This kind of news, when it spread, more people would know and be aware. Wu Yu could also feel more assured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he continued on his journey and did not relax.</span></p>
