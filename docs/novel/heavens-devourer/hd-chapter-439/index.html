 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The door of the front palace hall was also very tall and big. It was made from a material similar to that of the big door in front.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu approached it first and gathered his strength. He pushed this front palace hall door open. This door was easier to push. After pushing open a gap, he saw that it was dark and quiet inside. Because the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord was not in the front palace hall, they were not too worried and entered directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The front palace hall was large and spacious. The torches in Wu Yu's eyes burned brightly and instantly lit up this large, spacious palace hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the glow of the flames, the whole front palace hall seemed very simple and cold. However, upon looking carefully, they realized that the furniture, the stone tiles, the walls, and candlesticks were all forged from rare materials. There were signs of spirit designs that were previously etched on them. Hence, there was a high possibility that this whole Heaven Devouring Evil Lord was a dao treasure itself, or even more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, the spirit designs were all gone now. Hence, the materials with spiritual marks were probably damaged now. This Heaven Devouring Evil Residence was just a large, empty shell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu took one look and saw the furthest end of the front palace hall. There was another big door leading to the main palace hall. They would have to leave this place and enter the main palace hall. There, they could probably find what Luo Pin was seeking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He turned to look at Luo Pin. As expected, her eyes were staring straight at that door. She was a little excited. Obviously, she had once again sensed the call from the important treasure of the mystical dragon tribe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Let's go."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Pin moved and Wu Yu followed closely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had only moved a few steps when they suddenly sensed immense danger befalling upon them. Wu Yu and Luo Pin sensed it almost at the same time. They immediately stopped and braced their backs against each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's eyes spat out a few balls of fire. The flames gathered together and very quickly lit up the whole front palace hall. Now the whole place was as bright as day!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, every detail of the front palace hall could be seen clearly. That terrifying, suppressive aura was still present, but both of them saw nothing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What is it?" Wu Yu looked across their surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Heaven Devouring Evil Residence was too weird. Even though the front palace hall was now very bright, it still had a very creepy feeling!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Wu Yu and Luo Pin were both confused, the sense of danger from their surroundings sharpened. They could see over a thousand green light dots appear in their surroundings. These green light dots expanded quickly, each becoming about the size of an average human head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over a thousand green light dots appeared suspiciously in front of them just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That creepy, Green Glow was indeed horrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Wu Yu had not created light, these few thousand horrifying green light dots would only be more obvious in the dark!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they had just entered, they had not detected their existence at all. It was as though they had appeared out of nowhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What are these?" Wu Yu did not know much. His question was for Luo Pin, as well as Ming Long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he spoke, it seemed like two eyes and a mouth had surfaced on every single green light dot. At the positions of the eyes, the green color was darker, and for the mouth, that area sunk in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To be honest, they looked quite cute, but Wu Yu and Luo Pin still felt deeply threatened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Pin was surprised and whispered, "These should be spirits of the universe. Only spirits of the universe can be born in this sealed land. They do not depend on any heaven and earth spiritual qi to survive."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the first time Wu Yu had heard of the spirits of the universe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What are spirits of the universe?" He asked as he stared at these jade green little monsters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Pin explained, "They are living things which are neither humans, nor demons, nor immortal beasts. They were born of the heavens and earth. They cannot reproduce nor pass down legacies. They come in all forms and sizes. The possibilities are countless. For instance, the ones in front of you should be the Green Glows of the spirits of the universe. They were born within the heaven and earth under very special circumstances. Some are weak and post no threat, while some have great power. For instance, an existence like the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord should have been born directly from the heavens and earth. These are spirits of the universe!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regardless of martial cultivators or ghostly cultivators, all were human.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline"><span class="Apple-tab-span">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For demons, the range was wider. Other than humans, all living beings in the mortal world, like the fish and prawns in the rivers and seas, the beasts in the forests, insects, birds, and more, could all become demons after they gained sentience. Even plants and blood filth could become demons when they gained sentience. Only the spirits of the universe could be born within the heavens and earth just like that. Their most special characteristic would be that they had no parents and their types varied. For instance, the Green Glows in front of them were just bundles of light, but they seemed to be sentient and possessed strong powers and offensive abilities. However, they did not have cultivation levels like humans or demons. These were the spirits of the universe!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long also said, "That's right. In this sealed world, it's impossible for anyone to have children. These living spirits are obviously the very rare spirits of the universe. Since you guys are the only ones who have appeared on their territory, there is no doubt that they are very angry."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like Ming Long had said, these spirits of the universe were very upset now. They moved around and screamed in high pitch noises. They might look cute, but they had already surrounded the two of them. More Green Glows guarded the two big bronze doors in the front and back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had neither veins nor dantians. It was difficult to pinpoint their life structure. But just like the Yan Huang Ancient Souls, who relied on a yellow glow, these also had the power to battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Everyone, we have entered your territory by accident. Can you let us leave?" Wu Yu asked sincerely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unexpectedly, Luo Pin giggled and said, "They are like little beasts. They don't understand what you are saying."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He understood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the two of them did not let their guards down. At this moment, the Green Glows seemed very irritable. After they blocked the paths for Wu Yu and Luo Pin to leave, they started to close in on them. Green flames started to burn on their bodies, and they could see that these Green Glows moved very quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Green Glows only have one attack method, and that is to tackle. However, don't belittle the tackle. While I have not seen it, it is said that they can tackle anything to death. Their bodies are a type of attack."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Pin reminded him. Perhaps they were testing, but all of a sudden, a Green Glow flashed past. That speed of the tackle was terrifying, and it arrived in the blink of an eye!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A green flash moved past his eyes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within such a short time, Wu Yu reacted quickly. The Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff appeared in his hand. He flung it and it hummed, almost instantly crashing into that Green Glow with a loud, explosive sound!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu could not deny that his arm actually felt numb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he had not blocked, he would’ve been injured even with the Invincible Vajra Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hiss, hiss, hiss!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That Green Glow was slapped away by Wu Yu and flew out. It seemed to have shrunk. However, it was not dead. It was just weakened, but it seemed to have hissed louder. Under his leadership, the few thousand other Green Glows started hissing at the same time, letting out an ear-piercing sound!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Be careful!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Pin exhaled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the few thousand Green Glows actually rushed towards Wu Yu and Luo Pin at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One Green Glow was already not easy to handle, not to mention a few thousand of them. While the number of Green Glows was great, there was a limit to how many could actually tackle them at the same time. However, this was still relatively horrifying. Wu Yu had not faced such great danger in a long time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't be soft on them!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Pin reminded him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, if he did not use all his strength now, he would probably die under the continuous tackles of the Green Glows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tackles of the Green Glows were too frequent. Wu Yu had no idea how to defeat them at the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His hands grabbed the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff and activated a spirit design. Instantly, the Yan Emperor Heaven Splitting Design exploded. He swept the staff across and circled the surroundings. Fierce, golden flames instantly swept through their surroundings. Over 900 spirit designs started turning crazily. The staff swept away over 10 Green Glows, but at the same time, the Green Glows rushed at his head and feet. They ran directly onto Wu Yu's head and calves!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pssht!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu's calves were bleeding as though they had been pierced through by swords. His head was worse. His head had almost split apart after being tackled by a few Green Glows at the same time. He was already covered with flowing blood. He was dizzy and almost could not stand!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was just one round of attacks, and it had almost killed Wu Yu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These spirits of the universe were indeed crazy. Wu Yu did not even have the time to worry about the situation at Luo Pin's side. He was in a life or death situation now, and all he could do was remain conscious through this great pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Unshackled Doppelganger!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, he was surrounded by 100 doppelgangers. They squeezed away the Green Glows. Each doppelganger held a supreme immortal treasure longsword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oblivion Beast Soul Shocking Technique!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The 100 doppelgangers and Wu Yu simultaneously made their move just as the second round of attacks from the Green Glows reached them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Weng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An explosion!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over 100 vortexes added together and rushed out. Instantly, hundreds of Green Glows screamed and retreated. Their glow reduced by a lot. Obviously, a soul-shocking attack like the Oblivion Beast Soul Shocking Technique was effective against them. It meant that these life forms included the existence of a soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Except, this only made hundreds of Green Glows retreat temporarily. There were thousands here! Of which, at least 2,000 surrounded Wu Yu, splitting him and Luo Pin up!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now Wu Yu was bleeding all over. The green light on his body was shining. The remaining green light was still burrowing like swords into his body. He did not expect such cute-looking spirits to be so terrifying!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At least 10 of the 100 doppelgangers had been destroyed after using the Oblivion Beast Soul Shocking Technique. The next round of attacks was about to reach him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu clenched his jaw and ground his teeth. His doppelgangers stood as one and used the Oblivion Beast Soul Shocking Technique at the same time. There were a few loud, deafening explosions, and many Green Glow retreated again. But he lost yet another 10 doppelgangers, while these Green Glow were not dead yet. If they continued, neither he nor Luo Pin would last.</span></p>
