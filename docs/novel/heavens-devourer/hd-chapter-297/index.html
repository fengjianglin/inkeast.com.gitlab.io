 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he heard the voice, Wu Yu had a foreboding feeling in his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the demons, they revealed relaxed smiles. Their gazes on Wu Yu were finally a little confident. In fact, they seemed to be celebrating Wu Yu's expected demise.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Weng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the entire Void Lock trembled in shock. Wu Yu lifted his head and took a glance. The challenger had arrived and was standing on the barrier of the Void Lock.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Void Bird opened up a space agitatedly and let the challenger in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wu Yu saw the demon, he knew that his quest to gather 50 Demon Injunction Orders was probably going to be blocked off and he wouldn't be able to get the final three Demon Injunction Orders.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The demon was currently in his human form. He held his hands behind him and had a burly stature. He had short, blonde hair, blue eyes, and was wearing a cloth robe. His appearance was a young man, and it was clear to Wu Yu that his cultivation period hadn't been long. Nonetheless, it was a demon with an extremely high bloodline level.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I heard that he has been looking for Wu Yu for a long time. Now that we have found him, he probably heard the commotion and rushed over."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is great. With him around, there won't be any problems. If it wasn't for Wu Yu, the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey would have long gone to the Seventh Hunting Ground, or even the Eighth Hunting Ground."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Superfluous! The bloodline of the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey is stronger than ours in the. Moreover, his current cultivation level is the ninth tier of the Yaodan Realm!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That's right. He was probably the only ninth tier Yaodan Realm demon that Wu Yu had seen in the Sixth Hunting Ground. All aspects of him were outstanding. Although there are many existences that were stronger than the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey in the Supreme Hunting Ground, he was undoubtedly the ruler of the Sixth Hunting Ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only ape demon Wu Yu had an impression of was t the Ghost-Faced Ape. When he first saw the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey, he felt a sense of familiarity from its bloodline. However, the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey seemed to be really antagonistic towards him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu heard that the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey had been looking for him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just what did he want?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other party kept his hand behind him and stood on the swamp with the tip of his feet. It was as though he was floating on the swamp. He looked at Wu Yu and said, "I heard that you are a friend of Jiu Ying and have become the man of the hour recently. Moreover, you can even transform into a golden ape. I have long wanted to see how your transformation looks like."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clearly, the last part of his sentence was the real reason he was looking for Wu Yu. He must have been curious about Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey felt a little like he had encountered his kind when he saw Wu Yu. However, the truth was that one of them was a demon, while the other was a human.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A ninth tier Yaodan demon exceeded Wu Yu by five tiers in terms of jindan essence. This could be considered as an astronomical difference. Even if the quality of Wu Yu's Jindan could make up for the difference of one tier, the Nanwu Treasured Moon Golden Vajra Body couldn't possibly make up the huge difference for four tiers of jindan essenced.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What do you want?" To face such an obstruction when he was so close to succeeding, it was indeed frustrating. This Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey was truly powerful. Those demons behind him didn't dare to make any ruckus. This was because not only was the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey stronger and more talented than them, his status and background were also better than theirs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey smiled faintly and remarked, "I've been watching from the side for a while. You are really arrogant to claim that no one in the Sixth Hunting Ground is a match for you. The reason I'm here is naturally to tell you that there's always someone stronger out there. If you are trying to humiliate our demon race, you are still too young to achieve it. Although you are a friend of Jiu Ying, Jiu Ying can't even take care of himself now. I won't be courteous with you. Your 48th Demon Injunction Order is with me. If you have the guts, come and get it!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He extended his hand out and a Demon Injunction Order dangled there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After which, he put it away immediately. Step by step, he approached Wu Yu. As for the other demons, they were naturally protecting the Void Bird and had retreated to a corner. They were enthusiastic and thrilled to witness what would be developing. Now that they had reacted to the situation, they felt that they had been too ruthlessly suppressed by Wu Yu previously. They couldn't help but feel embarrassed by it as they whispered and whined among themselves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This Wu Yu isn't capable, but he sure is arrogant."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He even made such a bold claim. Now that he has encountered the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey, with the violent temperament of the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey, he will have a tough time."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Do you all think that the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey will finish him off? After all, the father of the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey holds a very high position. It is said that he is an important general serving under Zhu Huang. Although Zhu Huang is below Ying Huang, he has had the momentum to challenge Ying Huang's rule in recent years. The Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey might be daring enough to do it."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"So be it. Ying Huang is really horrifying, and I really respect and fear him. However, his son, Jiu Ying, is indeed useless. He has shamed the demons and even has friends in the human race. He is weak in nature and might be even weaker than the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Forget it. It's better for us to not talk about this. It doesn't concern us anyway. Just watch the show."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey has never held back in battle. Wu Yu is really going to be thrashed. This rascal is still quite capable. We almost allowed him to gather 50 Demon Injunction Orders. It was said that he even made a bet with the Enforcer of the First Hunting Ground, Jiang Zhuyue. If he could gather 50 Demon Injunction Orders, Jiang Zhuyue would lead him out of the Gloomy Dreams Sea."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Haha. His dreams of going home have been shattered."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Wu Yu's eyes, the speed of the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey was really slow. He wasn't in a hurry. When approaching Wu Yu, he was also observing Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This level of physical strength deserves my respect. It is just that your cultivation level is too low. This is your greatest weakness. You must be great at refining your body. However, on the path of cultivation, this is a stupid thing. I'm guessing you can't even defeat ordinary Shushan disciples!" The Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey chuckled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu wasn’t in the mood to quarrel with him. The only option he had was to fight. Now that he was in the Void Lock, there was no way he could escape.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he had never encountered an opponent at the equivalent level of a ninth tier Jindan Dao cultivator.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Wu Yu discarded everything except the resolve in his mind. That was to risk everything to defeat the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey. Despite facing such an enemy, Wu Yu's resolve to head home as soon as possible had not wavered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immortal Ape Transformation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In front of the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey, his body grew larger and stronger. In the blink of an eye, he transformed into the more violent Golden Ape form. Together with the Nine-Directional Demon Imprisonment Column, the current Wu Yu was in his true peak condition! That dominance, violence, and haughtiness welled up inside him and raised him to a new level. It was especially so in the aspect of his physical body, where he had forged the Nanwu Treasured Moon Golden Vajra Body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Not bad, interesting." The Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey took a closer look and his eyes lit up. At the same time, he transformed into his demon form. This process was similar to Wu Yu's Immortal Ape Transformation. It was just that the demon form was twice the size and thickness of Wu Yu. The Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey was also an ape with golden fur. However, it looked more majestic, more savage, and even had a pair of clear blue eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The body of the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey looked as though it was forged with gold, but its eyes were blue and more savage. Its claws, fangs, and muscles were rippling with power, exerting force at the pinnacle of the ninth tier of the Yaodan Realm. He looked just like an enlarged version of Wu Yu. Naturally, the difference in strength seemed to have been magnified too. Wu Yu and the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey looked extremely identical. It seemed like they were of the same species. However, one was just a child, while the other was a strong hunk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was also the most easily identified difference between the two of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, not bad!" Haughtiness gleamed in the eyes of the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey. As it moved, towering pressure swept towards Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Thousand Pound Column!" shouted the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey suddenly. Out of nowhere, a spiritual immortal treasure appeared in his hands and grew into a golden rod as tall as him in an instant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Demons also used spiritual immortal treasures. It was just that it wasn't the norm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That Thousand Pound Column seemed to have quite a number of spirit designs on it. The most distinct trait of it was than the two tips weren't flat and instead were protruding. A golden light reflected off them, and one could tell they were exceptionally sharp.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the Thousand Pound Column swept across, mud was swept alongside it like monstrous waves. As for the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey, he hidden himself within the waves of mud. The moment the battle started, Wu Yu felt the killing intent from his eyes. Without a doubt, the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey wanted to kill him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu immediately understood that not only would he be unable to return to Shushan, but he was about to die here. He was facing a predicament before, but now it had turned into a path of no return. In fact, even the surrounding demons had not expected any other demon to kill Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bam!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Thousand Pound Column moved rapidly within the hands of the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey. Clearly, he was well versed in it. On the face of that monkey, he revealed a very human-like and creepy smirk.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Smash, split, pierce!" The Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey tapped lightly on the Thousand Pound Column several times. The next instant, the sharp tips of the Thousand Pound Column glowed in a dazzling light. The blinding light shrouded the vision of various demons, and the Thousand Pound Column seemed to have become the center of the world suddenly. Under the transformation induced by a demon technique, the sharp tips of the rod seemed to have become a spiked club.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn't the end. The Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey had various killer moves. The moment he approached Wu Yu, he opened his mouth suddenly and let out a deafening, angry growl!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those who were familiar with the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey would know that this demon technique was called the Metallic Monkey Roar. The roar had explosive penetrative force. The first demon technique was to shroud Wu Yu's vision. As for the second demon technique, it was to make his ears buzz with noise. At that instant, it would be similar to feeling an incomparably powerful explosion going off beside you. It would hamper his hearing and vision. What would be left was probably only the fear of death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey had an overwhelming advantage in Yaodan essence. Yet he employed killing techniques without reserve. Clearly, he was doing his utmost to kill Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The next moment, countless lethal dangers shrouded over from all directions in the form of the Thousand Pound Column. If Wu Yu made a mistake, what awaited him would likely be real death. At this point, Wu Yu was facing a life and death crisis of epic proportions!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wu Yu learnt that his escape routes were blocked and how ruthless the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey was, he was in extreme anger. An even more horrifying defiance welled up in him. Such defiance originated from within him and erupted outwards. At this point, Wu Yu no longer found the Metallic Stone Immortal Monkey intimidating. No matter how strong his opponent was, as long as it was a head-to-head battle, there was no way he couldn't win!&nbsp;</span></p>
