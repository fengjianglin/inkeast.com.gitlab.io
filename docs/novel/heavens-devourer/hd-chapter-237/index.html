 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">9-9 Approaches to Medicine</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">, the simplest immortal medicine was naturally the Spirit Concentration Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xueya also knew how to make the Spirit Concentration Pill. Of all the immortal medicines, this Spirit Concentration Pill was the easiest to make.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wei sat cross-legged in a corner of this training room. Various colored flames danced on her and rolled across her body. That nine-colored flame was like a cocoon and wrapped her within. In the flames, you could feel the change happening at every moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu, on the other hand, was at another corner of the training room. He first performed a blood bond on the Three-Legged Cauldron. Then he placed it before his eyes and used his heart to sense the immortal treasure spirit design of this Three-Legged Cauldron. This immortal treasure spirit design included various effects, like air-blast, refining, magnifying, and adjustment of immortal fire. Its immortal treasure spirit design was comprehensive, and compared to a normal cauldron, the success rate was much higher.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spirit designs were something even more complicated and mysterious than immortal medicines. Wu Yu was not anxious to fashion spirit designs right now. He wanted to first understand how to refine immortal medicines.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was said that any successful martial cultivator would have relatively outstanding abilities in refining immortal medicines and fashioning spirit designs. This was especially true for fashioning spirit designs. A big offensive spirit design and a big defensive spirit design could determine an individual's battle power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While the Galaxy Sword Sage was still testing him, Wu Yu was not anxious. The path to martial cultivation was most cautious to having an anxious and irritable state of mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Refining immortal medicines required the most precise control and hence, he could train his mind. The fire, the timing, the moment to bring the medicine out, the strength, and more factors all required precise control. They all directly affected the success of the immortal medicine. It was not as simple as just firing everything in quality immortal fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu spent some time to familiarize himself with the Three-Legged Cauldron before he started to study the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">9-9 Approaches to Medicine</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">. In this refining art, the first thing taught was how Wu Yu could control and flexibly use immortal fire. Immortal fire was like his arms - it needed to be trained, to be controlled, before it could perform according to his will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While this was basic, it was a relatively important basic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ability to control fire concerned the strength of the fire, and that was the root of the dao of immortal medicines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Wu Yu seemed to be a natural at fire control. Following the instructions in the immortal medicine book, in less than a day, the immortal fire could change into any shape in his hands. He had a high perception. The strength of his immortal fire was practically controlled at the whims of his mood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now he could almost have the fire burn into an opponent's body without burning off the clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon reaching this step in the immortal medicine book, Wu Yu started studying the first type of medicine refining method for the Spirit Concentration Pill. It was the nin-type refinement method. It differentiated mainly in the materials used. The steps to refinement were different for different materials, and the supplementary materials required were different as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of these methods required the use of a one-spiritual mark immortal essence - the Hundred Thousand Spirit Flower - and a few supporting immortal essences. Coincidentally, Wu Yu had all these materials, so he was already prepared for his first refinement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Firstly, he needed to heat up the Three-Legged Cauldron and allow its immortal treasure spirit design to start up. Within the cauldron, a refining environment would be created, and at this point, he needed control over his immortal fire. This was because the temperature was very important to this environment. He had to guarantee that his immortal fire maintained a certain strength. Once the heat increased or decreased, the immortal essences that had just entered the cauldron could be destroyed or fail to dissolve to a satisfactory state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was very familiar with the 9-9 immortal medicine book. He followed the steps strictly. He had already measured the main and supplementary materials and placed them in the cauldron based on a special sequence and ratio.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Other than the start up of the spirit designs, he also needed to add a few spiritual arts into the cauldron to aid in the dissolving of materials.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When clouds started to surround the interior of the cauldron and he could start to see the mixing of the spiritual plants, the cauldron’s lid would be placed. He had to control the immortal fire, fire up the immortal treasure spirit design, and start to burn it at high heat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Why is this so similar to cooking?"</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wu Yu was momentarily stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, he was not wrong. The refinement of immortal medicine was very similar to cooking. Disciples who were good at cooking progressed very quickly when they first encountered the dao of immortal medicines. It was because they were very familiar with the theories of cooking, including the difficulties of controlling the timing and adjusting the heat accordingly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter what, the refinement of Spirit Concentration Pills was still the simplest, and the number of spiritual arts required were not many too. At the second half of the refinement, Wu Yu was just controlling fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was his first refinement, so he did not have many ideas of his own. He strictly followed the steps. He carried out the instructions precisely and basically did not meet with any problems.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He basically had no problems, especially on the control of immortal fire. The next problem was when to activate the respective immortal treasure spirit designs. This was not difficult either because the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">9-9 Approaches to Medicine</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;had introduced this in great detail. It even included many realizations of previous disciples after reading. Wu Yu had basically avoided all these past mistakes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For instance, if the heat increased at a particular moment, the immortal medicine would be flawed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For instance, if he used the wrong immortal treasure spirit design, then the immortal medicine would be instantly destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For instance, if he heated it for a longer period of time, the effect of the immortal medicine would be lost and its spiritual power would disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This whole process was still quite unnerving for Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, an aroma wafted out from the Three-Legged Cauldron. It was a strong aroma which indicated that the immortal medicine had been formed. He gradually retracted the immortal fire and controlled the immortal treasure spirit designs to stop. At the last moment, he baked the medicine at high heat and opened the cauldron lid. Instantly, a stream of white fog rushed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's a success!"</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The white fog dissipated and Wu Yu looked into the Three-Legged Cauldron. There were more than 10 white immortal medicines. Wu Yu immediately retrieved them and ate one. He realized that he had indeed been successful. It was no different from the other Spirit Concentration Pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It smells so good." Nangong Wei pushed her dainty nose forward. Then she looked at Wu Yu in an idolizing manner and said, "Big Brother, you are indeed strong. I heard that it is rare to succeed on your first refinement of immortal medicine. In the future, you will definitely be some great master."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu said, "This art is indeed not simple, I must not be proud and must try a few more times."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wei's eyes widened as she said with anticipation, "Big Brother, are you going to refine Golden Essence Pills? If only you could refine the Golden Essence Pills. Then we would have an unlimited supply of them!" &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, he would require materials. Except that these materials were not worth as much as the Golden Essence Pills. If he could refine them, then he would save a lot of trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing what Nangong Wei said, Wu Yu was tempted. He felt that since he could succeed on his first refinement of the Spirit Concentration Pill, he might succeed at refining the Golden Essence Pill. If he had this ability, all he would need in the future was to prepare the materials.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He started to study and read through a few methods. He realized that the refinement of the Golden Essence Pill was much more difficult. It concerned the control of immortal treasure spirit design, the control of immortal fire, and the complexity of the spiritual arts. However, this did not scare him. He still followed the steps and carried them out carefully. It was just that the process was too complicated, and with a slight discrepancy, his cauldron would explode. The immortal essences inside the cauldron would be burnt into crisps and turn into ashes....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, it was not only that he failed, but Wu Yu also wasted a set of two-spiritual mark immortal essences and five sets of one-spiritual mark immortal essences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He still wanted to try, but the materials were insufficient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Looks like I still need to take things one step at a time. My learning in refining immortal medicines better start with the Spirit Concentration Pill before I take it step by step to the Golden Essence Pill. In between, I can try the refinement of Antidote Pills and Exorcist Pills."</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wu Yu calmed down and did not push forward recklessly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he finally understood what the refining of immortal medicines was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Resources were paramount to martial cultivators. Of which, the resources of immortal medicines was a relatively important part. If he could have the ability to turn immortal essences into immortal medicines, then the value of the former would at least double.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immortal essences worth one Golden Essence Pill would be worth at least two Golden Essence Pills once they were refined into immortal medicines. In fact, he could not purchase top-quality immortal medicines. He would need his own unique materials and methods to refine them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The methods to immortal medicine refining, the future path to martial cultivation. When I need to do is settle down and be calm. I can try it frequently. At the moment, I still need to study the dao technique."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had sensed that the need for full focus to control immortal fire for the refinement of immortal medicines would raise his spirits and resilience.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a calmer demeanor, he could progress faster in refining his Jindan and training in dao techniques. Wu Yu naturally did not waste the great volume of spiritual qi that he had bought for 10 merits per month. After studying the refining of immortal medicines for a few days, he put it down and focused entirely on refining his Jindan and training the Yin Yang Heaven-Earth-Void Sword Art.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You had to admit that the Great Way of Immortality Art was scary. When Wu Yu was refining his Jindan, at least 3/4 of the spiritual qi in this training room was taken by him and added into his Jindan, causing it to grow in strength and size.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu thought about the matter regarding Shen Xingyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"In Shushan, I have no one to rely on. This equates to not having any base. Even if I have greater talent, I will still be looked down upon by others and have to abide to their whims. I will even be coveted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"When I was at the Heavenly Sword Sect, the reason I could rise quickly was because Master had chosen me.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Today, that Shen Xingyao may have detected that I am different before making that decision. It allowed me to gain fame. If he is as Wei Er said, then he is a senior worthy of respect and I will fight to train with him. This is also a huge opportunity. With Shen Xingyao as my shield, I can practically go anywhere in the Shushan Immortal Sect, and I will no longer need to be afraid of people like Zhang Futu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The so-called dao fanatic probably has some morals. If that is the case, then I, Wu Yu, have to grab this opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Afterall, there are numerous people envious, jealous and even hating me now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They cannot wait to see me embarrass myself. How can I let them have their way?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After making up his mind, Wu Yu entered his training state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the moment, he didn’t have many Golden Essence Pills. Even if he kept using the Jindan Condensation Wondrous Art to refine his Jindan, he still needed to take things one step at a time and stabilize his Jindan first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, the more important thing was to understand the Yin Yang Heaven-Earth-Void Sword Art. This was the dao technique worth more than 400 merits. It was a deeply mysterious knowledge even for Wu Yu. It was much more difficult to understand compared to Feng Xueya's Sword of No Form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were thousands of words just on the various descriptions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was said that yin yang existed in the heavens and earth, yang in the heavens and yin in the earth. Between heaven and earth was a void. This sword cultivator dao technique emphasized on the heavens, earth, and man. This was the reconciliation of yin and yang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When cultivating, one had to experience heaven and earth, to seek the changes of this world and the yin yang of everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In reality, this dao technique that Wu Yu had found was very suitable for him. He had entered sword cultivation from the immortal root of the Yin Yang Dao Sword. It was an immortality art that required two uses with one effort. He understood that quicker than others.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Visualizing the Inner Ape."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After meeting with difficult problems, he entered the spiritual world to calm down and think.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Unparalleled Monkey King bathing in golden flames in his imagination was changing ever so slightly and seemed to always aid Wu Yu in finding a breakthrough point.</span></p>
