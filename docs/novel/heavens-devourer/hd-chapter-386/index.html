 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among the 3,000-odd ghostly cultivators, at least 2,000 were taunted by Wu Yu as they roared and charged forward.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among which, at least 1,000 headed towards Deep Pine Camp and Green Willow Camp.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Wu Yu's side, he took a glance and found that roughly 300 ghostly cultivators were attacking them. Compared to Deep Pine Camp and Green Willow Camp, the pressure he was facing was relatively lower.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, Wu Yu had 10 of his doppelgangers at his Heaven's Equal Camp. That was the equivalent of almost 10 Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivators. For a team to have more than 15 Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivators was unimaginable. Wu Yu knew clearly that even if he discounted himself, Chen Cangsong, and Fang Qingliu, the other two Camps wouldn't be a match for his Heaven's Equal Camp and his doppelgangers in a direct confrontation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In their Camps, there were at most two to three Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivators.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As there were only roughly 300 ghostly cultivators who weren't even at the Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea Realm, Wu Yu decided to let most of them off to give his Heaven's Equal Camp an opportunity to train. All he did was target those who were behaving strangely or those who were eighth tier Jindan Dao cultivators and above. The remaining 200 ghostly cultivators charged directly into Heaven's Equal Camp.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On this matter, each small team of 10 was required to stop over 20 ghostly cultivators under the leadership of Wu Yu's doppelgangers!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battle erupted instantly. In the blink of an eye, endless amounts of seawater tumbled violently under a strong impact. Soon, blood filled the surroundings. In life and death battles to attain Immortal Dao, no one would show mercy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Showing mercy to others would be showing cruelty to oneself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu understood this and therefore struck even more heavily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wherever his Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff landed, a ghostly cultivator would be sent flying off with a strike.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They would either spit blood while flying back or were crippled on the spot. Some even died upon impact!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Amidst the deep sea, Wu Yu was burning in golden flames and his eyes were just like the scorching sun. Putting aside the idea of going against Wu Yu's physical body directly, just meeting his eyes had torched the eyes of countless ghostly cultivators, turning them blind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Kill that centurion!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Go for the ringleader before rounding up the others!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The group of ghostly cultivators were innately fearful of Wu Yu. Therefore, they gathered over 20 people and surrounded Wu Yu. At that instant, various kinds of ghostly cultivator attacks smashed towards Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vengeful spirits and evil ghosts, savage blood curses, and putrefaction flows shot towards Wu Yu, carrying with them filth and corpses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu snorted and the entire sea region shook. Subsequently, he enlarged the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff in his hands, letting it grew to over 30 zhang in the blink of an eye. Wu Yu swung it across the group of ghostly cultivators, crushing them as though he was cutting vegetables. The corpses of these ghostly cultivators flew back and basically shattered into pieces under the impact of this domineering supreme immortal treasure!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In less than 20 breaths of time, he finished off the ghostly cultivators around him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking towards Heaven's Equal Camp, they were stuck in a long, drawn-out battle. However, with Wu Yu's doppelgangers around, he knew that it wouldn't be a problem to overwhelm the 200-odd ghostly cultivators. This could be seen from the fact that the side of ghostly cultivators had experienced huge casualties, while Heaven's Equal Camp had not seen significant injuries or deaths from the very beginning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Basically, whenever a problem was discovered, one of Wu Yu's doppelgangers would immediately resolve it brutally.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, on the east flank, the large number of ghostly cultivators who had gathered were alarmed by the commotion at the west flank. They were afraid of being left behind and therefore couldn't wait to charge forward and launch their attacks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was that Huangfu Pojun had a similar idea as Wu Yu, despite them not having discussed this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These ghostly cultivators were just a motley crowd. They were gathering and standing at a distance, waiting for an opportunity to attack together. With no one leading the way, they had chosen to wait.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this was allowed to go on, the number of ghostly cultivators would only increase. At that time, both flanks would face more than 10,000 ghostly cultivators. If there were a few powerful ghostly cultivators among them when they launched an all-out attack, the casualties would be grave, let alone being able to withstand the attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cause of the two centurions' death were largely under similar circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huangfu Pojun was thinking of putting his thoughts into action, Wu Yu asked for permission to do so. He had investigated Wu Yu's background and knew that he had similar experiences when it came to grand warfare.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In some occasions, mortals weren't any inferior to cultivators in the aspects of wisdom and strategy. In fact, mortals might be even better! This was because mortals had limited capabilities. Therefore, they would expend more effort in thinking about ways to achieve victory besides relying on battle capacity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the very minimum, the effects were great based on the outcome around the small region where Wu Yu was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those ghostly cultivators that had charged forward were soon crushed completely. They were injured or dead or were escaping.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Towards the end, it became Heaven's Equal Camp surrounding and attacking the ghostly cultivators.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing how strong Wu Yu was, the other ghostly cultivators were even more wary of approaching his region.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a core-tail talisman flew towards Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu caught and read it. It was instruction from Huangfu Pojun on allocation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Yu, support Chen Cangsong and Fang Qingliu."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clearly, Huangfu Pojun knew about the situation of this place. Chen Cangsong's camp and Fang Qingliu's camp were facing opponents more than two times larger than the one Wu Yu's camp was facing. Moreover, the ghostly cultivators seemed to have chosen to swarm towards their area after noticing a bigger opening in their camps.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Protect this place!" Wu Yu didn't think too much into it. With his doppelgangers remaining here, the issue wasn't grave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The most important things about a soldier would be to follow orders and allocation. Therefore, he did not hesitate when he received the instruction.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lifting his Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff, he leaped from the bottom of the sea and charged rapidly towards the region controlled by Chen Cangsong. Along the way, he slayed countless ghostly cultivators and disrupted the crowd. When Wu Yu arrived at the region controlled by Chen Cangsong, it was a chaotic scene. As there were truly too many ghostly cultivators, quite a number of Yan Huang Immortal Soldiers had died.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The main reason was because Chen Cangsong and Fang Qingliu were occupied by their opponents. As such, the Yan Huang Immortal Soldiers around were separated and had to fight their own battles. Once they were cornered by ghostly cultivators, their chances of dying in battle increased substantially.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, the dao techniques of ghostly cultivators were eerie and ruthless. As long as one was hit by one, the chances of dying from it were high.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Amidst the chaotic battles, Wu Yu soon found the two of them. At Wu Yu's region, he had only encountered one or two Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivators. Moreover, they were just at the first tier. Therefore, Wu Yu easily and quickly disposed of them. However, there were two Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivators at the center region. Moreover, there were third tier Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivators!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two ghostly cultivators had completely restricted the actions of Chen Cangsong and Fang Qingliu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was also because of this that Chen Cangsong had sought reinforcements from Huangfu Pojun, who eventually summoned Wu Yu over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The really rich ones are finally here!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For Wu Yu, the other ghostly cultivators were all small battles. He wouldn't be able to get much wealth even if he defeated dozens of them. The really rich ghostly cultivators were often like the opponents Chen Cangsong and Fang Qingliu were facing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Both of them are really arrogant. When battling ghostly cultivators, not only did they not have the upperhand, but they have been pinned down. Clearly, they aren't as acclimatized to battling underwater as those ghostly cultivators."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With them not even able to take care of themselves, how could one rely on them to protect the other Yan Huang Immortal Soldiers?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No time to lose!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was rapid and domineering. His Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff was unparalleled. With momentum of a thousand-strong army, he forcefully plunged it towards the back of Chen Cangsong's opponent. The opponent was an old ghostly cultivator who clearly had cultivated for a long time. He was emaciated and had black spots all over his face. One of his eyes was blinded and the remaining area was shimmering in green glow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ghostly cultivator was engaging in an intense battle with Chen Cangsong. The Heaven Earth Void technique of Chen Cangsong grew large amount of trees from the bottom of the sea, forming a tough and hardy forest. As for that ghostly cultivator, he happened to be a perfect counter to Chen Cangsong. He controlled black flames and transformed them into thousands of ferocious tigers which scorched through the forest expeditiously. Chen Cangsong could only flee desperately.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those black flames were even able to scorch the seawater, turning it into steam upon touch.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu appeared behind that ghostly cultivator like a phantom and caught him by surprise. As for Chen Cangsong, he was able to notice Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, he understood that Wu Yu was here to support him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he wasn't pleased with his actions. In addition, he wouldn't want Wu Yu to see his wretched condition.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luckily, he continued fighting with the ghostly cultivator. He probably didn't want to give up his opponent to Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu wasn't going to be courteous with him!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The instant he appeared behind the ghostly cultivator, he struck without a second word. Moreover, he went for the kill directly!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the tumbling water streams, he held the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff in one hand while forming seals with the other. His fingers were swift and rapid and soon, black dragons were formed one after another, circling and swimming around him. When Wu Yu completed his seals, there was a total of eight dragons!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That instant, Wu Yu let out a deafening roar.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Dragon Enslavement Heaven Imprisonment Technique!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, he sank his five fingers onto the sea bed. Following a huge explosion, the sand and rocks spouted outwards. A huge, black vortex was culminating below the legs of Wu Yu, Chen Cangsong, and the ghostly cultivator. At this point, Chen Cangsong was still exchanging blows with the ghostly cultivator. The moment the ghostly cultivator was devoured by the black vortex, he lost his balance temporarily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That ghostly cultivator was also alarmed. He had not expected to be ambushed by a Heaven Earth Void technique. Just as he was about to escape, eight huge mystical dragons formed from black fog emerged from the black vortex in eight directions. As the eight dragons charged out and slithered rapidly, they intercrossed and trapped the ghostly cultivator within an exceptionally short period!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Looking to die?!" The ghostly cultivator was enraged and struggled frantically!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there was no way Wu Yu would allow him to escape after executing the Dragon Enslavement Heaven Imprisonment Technique for the very first time! The moment he completed executing his Heaven Earth Void technique, he raised the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff with both of his hands, jumped up high, and smashed down like the sun.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Huang Emperor Earth Shattering Design!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff, countless spirit designs were circulating. At the instant, Wu Yu shot out dazzling golden rays. Those blinding rays masked the sea region all the way to Heaven's Equal Camp. Even the east flank would be able to notice it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was as though a ginormous sun had suddenly risen from the bottom of the sea in the west flank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Argh!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ghostly cultivator was trapped by Wu Yu's Dragon Enslavement Heaven Imprisonment Technique. Just when he couldn't move and was struggling with all his might, Wu Yu's Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff smashed heavily onto his head. His soul was shattered into pieces instantly and he died on the spot.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden rays dissipated gradually. Wu Yu accelerated at this point and took away the valuables of the ghostly cultivator, including his supreme immortal treasure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Chen Cangsong was still in shock, Wu Yu had collected all the items.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first time Chen Cangsong had truly witnessed how terrifying Wu Yu was in battle!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn't a joke. Wu Yu had spent a long time searching before he found the Dragon Enslavement Heaven Imprisonment Technique. This was such that he could use it in concert with an attack from the Yan Huang Heaven Raising Staff.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While feeling shock, surprise, and disbelief, he also felt bottled up and failure! Considering the fact that Wu Yu had also taken all the opponent's items away right before his eyes, Chen Cangsong was infuriated. "Wu Yu, he is my opponent. Leave his valuables behind. Those are mine!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu turned around, glanced at him and said, "Rubbish. If it weren't for me, you wouldn't get anything from the ghostly cultivator. Oh, right, if you still want to be entangled here because of this incident, your Deep Pine Camp will likely be finished."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Cangsong was incomparably furious. After all, this wave of attacks was incited by Wu Yu and yet they were the ones suffering from it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, one fact he couldn't deny was that his Deep Pine Camp was close to crumbling completely. They were desperately in need of him to stabilize the situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Our feud will be accounted for after the battle!" said Chen Cangsong while gritting his teeth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wu Yu had charged towards Fang Qingliu's opponent at this point.</span></p>
