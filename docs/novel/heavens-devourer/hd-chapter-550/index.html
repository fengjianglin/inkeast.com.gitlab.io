 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Catching on to Li Changgong's hints, Bai Xueyuan giggled and said, "It would be my blessing to be the dao companion of such a talented person like Senior Brother Li. After all, Senior brother Li is not only talented, but also has a high status. Your father holds great power in the Cloud Immortal Kingdom, and he also has an enviable high cultivation level.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Speaking of this, Li Changgong was quite proud. However, he looked calm and humbly said, "Don't praise me, Little Sister. I'm really ashamed. Compared to my father, I'm a little far behind. What's more, Little Sister is the young master of the Snow Expanse. the Cloud Immortal Kingdom must be respectful because of the huge power the Snow Expanse has. It's my luck to have been taken to the same planet as Little Sister."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They complimented and flirted with each other for a long time. Wu Yu seemed to have no chance to interrupt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But at least he had heard where these two people were from. One came from the Cloud Immortal Kingdom and the other came from the Snow Expanse. Wu Yu did not know where these two places were or what level of strength they had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His understanding of the Yan Huang Ancient Region was limited to what the Yan Huang City Lord had told him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ming Long, where are these two places? Are they far away from the Yan Huang Ancient Country?" Wu Yu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You better be more polite if you want to ask me questions," Ming Long said arrogantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was speechless. He specially changed into a better tone before Ming Long said, "I don't know what the Snow Expanse is, but the Cloud Immortal Kingdom is a country. I think it's at the Northern Hell Snow Continent. The Northern Hell Snow Continent is one of the few northern continents of the Yan Huang Ancient Region. It is very far from the central region. They are about five continents apart. Let me tell you, there are many countries at the Yan Huang Ancient Region, and some countries cannot be easily entered."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had thought about it before, and the best choice was to look for martial cultivators from the Yan Huang Ancient Country. This way, he could go there directly to inform the people of the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord. If Wu Yu could meet someone willing to pass the message for him, that would even be better. It was just that the divine continent did not have much time left, and Wu Yu could not force people to travel to the Yan Huang Ancient Country just to pass a message for him. Hence, he had to work as things progressed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the two before him, firstly, they were too far away and were not the best choice. Next, they were here because they wanted to save him. If he turned around to harm them, it would not be right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, he put aside the issue with the Heaven Devouring Evil Lord first. If he could make friends with these two, then he could at least understand a little more about the Taigu Immortal Path and the Yan Huang Ancient Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Li Changgong and Bai Xueyuan were chatting enthusiastically. Li Changgong was a humorous person, and he made Bai Xueyuan laugh continuously. Their gazes were on each other. They probably felt attracted to each other. They probably hadn’t met before entering the Taigu Immortal Path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh, yes, you, come here. I want to ask if you came across the Taigu Immortal Path by chance and accidentally entered. You are really lucky. You didn't have to experience selection trials, yet you received the same reward as us by coincidence. Your experience is enviable."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Li Changgong looked at Wu Yu and waved him over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was confused. Why would this Li Changgong determine that he had entered the Taigu Immortal Path by accident and wasn’t qualified to be here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Xueyuan also looked over. She smiled and said, "Actually, he's not that lucky. After all, the Taigu Immortal Path is too dangerous. If not for our arrival, he may not have escaped if he activated his Taigu Immortal Talisman a little later. Since ancient times, every time the Taigu Immortal Path opens, there are a few lucky people who suddenly have the gateway to the Taigu Immortal Path open beside them. I did not think that we would be so blessed to meet one here. It's just that some pitiful person cannot come in now after working hard to win the selection trial."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Canghai said, "This guy is only a fourth tier Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea cultivator. He must be the weakest among those who entered. You must know that all the others who enter are at least at the eighth tier of the Violent Kingdom of the Inner Sea Realm. Also, they may have some special talents."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu finally understood from their conversation that his cultivation must have led to this misunderstanding. He thought for awhile. If he moved with these two, they would treat him like a follower. It would not be comfortable for him. Hence, he walked up to them and calmly said, "I'm Wu Yu. Thank you for your help, but I need to make something clear. I did not enter the gateway to Taigu Immortal Path by accident, but by...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Changgong laughed silently and said, "Looks like you really treasure your pride. Forget it. It looks like you are quite lucky. We'll not argue with you. You still have to depend on yourself in this Taigu Immortal Path. We can save you once, but not every time. After all, everyone is busy and has no time to look after you. Now the two of us are trying to find out how to leave this planet. Since you are of no help, you can explore the surroundings by yourself."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not have the intention to travel with Wu Yu as well. After saying so, he left with Bai Xueyuan. After all, he treasured this precious couple time, and no matter what, refused to be disturbed by Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Xueyuan turned back and instructed him before leaving. "You are called Wu Yu, right? Actually, you don't have to worry. At the moment, there are only three of us on this whole planet. No one will attack you. If you're interested, you should think of a way to leave this place."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them left quickly, as though they were afraid that Wu Yu would disturb them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu was speechless and laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long mocked him. "Are you stupid? They are busy flirting. Why did you disturb them? If I were you, I'd definitely have hidden far away before being contaminated by those two disgusting lovebirds."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu replied, "They're okay, just a little proud. But they helped when they saw me in danger, We cannot gossip about them behind their backs. We better find a way to leave this planet or see if there is anything else here."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long said, "Save you? You think too much. It's just that they wanted to take advantage of that great opportunity to show the other party how strong they are so that they can flirt with each other. If it were me, I would not waste so much effort - I would’ve just jumped on that person."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How are you gonna jump on him? Are you a guy?" Wu Yu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ming Long was angered and said, "Don't you dare mock me, your grandmother, if I were a guy, I would definitely have three wives and four concubines. I would have beauties surrounding me. I would have a palace filled with 3,000 beauties. I can call on a different one every day and never repeat."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not expect her to be so open.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Taigu Immortal Path did not seem too lonely with Ming Long's company.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Come to think of it, she seemed to be the person who had accompanied him the longest. From the beginning, the two of them were calculative of each other. Now they seemed to help each other naturally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After becoming an immortal, reviving Ming long was the most important thing for Wu Yu. No matter how hard it would be, he would accomplish it. This was one of the most important promises he made in his life, no less than when he vowed to find Luo Pin and catch up to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After saying goodbye to the two, Wu Yu wandered around the planet. It was not big. When he was observing carefully, he still met them several times. When they saw Wu Yu, they immediately dodged and did not give Wu Yu a chance to talk to or follow them. So every time Ming Long saw them, she would scold those disgusting lovebirds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After about a day or two, Wu Yu had already combed the whole surface of the planet under the great gravity. He also tried to break through and rush out from the spirit design several times but failed to gain anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There's nothing on the surface of this planet except the metal ground and rocks. There is nothing, not even a drop of water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Other than metal, there’s more metal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There’s no way I can be trapped in this planet for a year. It's full of changes and variables, so there must be a way to leave this black planet!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu wanted to meet more people urgently and find the right people that would help him reach the Yan Huang Ancient Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, he was also searching the surface of the star frantically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The point is in that spirit design in the sky. How can I destroy it?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other planets that he could see were probably trapped inside as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he was also not sure. Perhaps someone had left their planet and entered the vast, endless sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Spirit design."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He guessed that if there was a way to crack it, it would have something to do with the spirit design, so he wanted to study the spirit design in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, he stood on the ground and poked at the spirit design in the sky with the Violent Dragon Pillar of the Vast Ocean. Every time he touched it, the dark spirit design would appear. Wu Yu could see the drawings and details of the spirit design. It was a huge Heaven and Earth Spirit Design, and the entire spirit design and the whole star were almost perfectly connected.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He felt that there were some connections between the spirit design and the Taigu Immortal Talisman. There were four key positions in the spirit design, all of which were connected to four Taigu Immortal Talismans. Three of them were still connected, and the other one was blank, probably because the sea-breaking lobster had left. And that blank spot seemed to affect the whole spirit design. The whole spirit design seemed to be a little bit weaker than it was at the beginning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu finally understood.</span></p>

Perhaps this manipulator has already left considering the passage of time, yet the countless spirit designs are still in operation. The fact that there is a pattern in the operation of these spirit designs indicates manual intervention.</em></span></p>

There must be a way to create some form of change to the situation.</em></span></p>
