 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite the rules of the battles in the Mortal Arena, Wu Yu knew that the Shushan Immortal Sect wouldn't rest when he killed Beishan Mo in Shushan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was also the purpose of having the Imperial General follow him here. Otherwise, he wouldn't have done so.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial General had made preparations even before Wu Yu. The instant Wu Yu killed Beishan Mo and turned around towards the black warship, the Imperial General tossed out an unknown immortal treasure, or perhaps even a dao treasure....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regardless, Wu Yu had just caught a glimpse of it when he was sucked in instantly. The surroundings were pitch-black and a shocking huge force made him stay stationary within, not daring to move an inch.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vaguely, that black treasure was an ancient, black clock. It enlarged, sucked Wu Yu in, and returned to the Imperial General in the blink of an eye.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After returning to the Imperial General on the black warship, Wu Yu was then released from the pitch-black environment and regained his vision. He fell on the deck, and the treasure of the Imperial General disappeared within his hand in an instant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sha, sha!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The generals of Yan Huang Imperial City surrounded Wu Yu subconsciously. As for the majestic and domineering Imperial General, who was wearing a suit of black armor, he stood before Wu Yu and protected him. In a solemn tone, he said, "On the Mortal Arena, there should be rules regarding a life-and-death battle after it is arranged. Shushan broke the rules by adding an opponent for Wu Yu at the very last moment. It was just that Wu Yu didn't press the matter. Even though Wu Yu has killed the Shushan genius, everything is within reason. I believe the people of Shushan won't deny their own defeat. Otherwise, if this gets out, you guys will be the butt of the joke! After all, Beishan Mo was the one who challenged Wu Yu to a life-and-death battle. You guys should have been prepared for his death. Take us for an example. We came with the preparations that Wu Yu might very well die in battle."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A person like the Imperial General would only take advantage of others within the rules. Clearly, he wouldn't allow others to break the rules to take advantage of him. Therefore, when Wu Yu struck, he was already prepared to protect Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu stood on that black warship and looked down on the million sword cultivators around the Mortal Arena. He noticed that countless sword cultivators were now looking at him with fear and respect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their eyes had shown that their hearts and dao had been crushed by Wu Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the very minimum, the majority of the ordinary dan disciples of the Common Sword Domain hung their heads dispiritedly. They couldn't muster any will to resist. Although they felt infuriatingly humiliated, they couldn't display their emotions. This was because they were now facing not just Wu Yu alone, but also Yan Huang Imperial City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Including the Imperial General, a legendary character.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Amidst the mountains of people, Wu Yu glanced at Nangong Wei on the Mortal Arena. She was sitting apprehensively on the floor with her head down. Her black hair covered her face and one couldn't see her expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu heaved a sigh. Although he had advised her against acting rash and committing acts she would regret, her hatred for him had now reached a whole different level. He was here with the intention of severing past ties. However, this wouldn't seem possible anymore. After these ties were converted to hatred, it wouldn't end till one party perished. As for how Nangong Wei would treat him, he really couldn't foresee.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before the black warship were the Mizar Sword Immortal, the Ursae Sword Immortal, and a dozen-odd Shushan Sword Sages. Among the Shushan Sword Sages, there were some like the Lunar Flower Sword Sage, who was calling for killing Wu Yu as revenge for Beishan Mo. There were also some like Shen Xingyao, who kept his silence. His attitude was probably similar to the that of the Ursae Sword Immortal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ursae Sword Immortal and the Mizar Sword Immortal were clearly on extreme ends.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the Mizar Sword Immortal's eyes were bloodshot. He glowered at the Imperial General and released his strength as a Primordial Spirit Transformation cultivator. Despite facing the Imperial General, he wasn't intending to back off. He shouted furiously, "Imperial General! Wu Yu is just a discarded disciple of Shushan. Is Yan Huang Imperial City really going to get involved in this matter? Now that he has killed Beishan Mo, we have a great enmity against him! Regardless, our Shushan Immortal Sect will see Wu Yu as our nemesis! We will kill him the moment we see him! The Shushan Immortal Sect and Yan Huang Imperial City have been on good terms for generations. We are both orthodox sects on the divine continent. I believe the Imperial General wouldn't want to stand on the opposite end against the Shushan Immortal Sect for a discarded disciple, right?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before the Imperial General responded, the Ursae Sword Immortal interrupted, "Mizar, Wu Yu has acted within the rules for the battle today. He won it fair and square, and our Shushan has to admit it. After all, Beishan Mo was the one who raised this request. Wu Yu had his own mysterious encounter, and you shouldn't harp on it. It isn't that Shushan has lost all hope just because we have lost Beishan Mo. Everything in the world has its own fate. Beishan Mo lost because he wasn't as skilled. Let's not embarrass ourselves before the Imperial General and the people from Yan Huang Imperial City."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had high regard for Wu Yu from the very beginning. It was just that he was forced to expel Wu Yu before. Considering Wu Yu's performance today, Wu Yu had won the recognition of the Ursae Sword Immortal. Perhaps the Ursae Sword Immortal believed that it was impossible to kill Wu Yu, who was being protected by the Imperial General. As such, they were better off not straining their relationship. Otherwise, they might draw real trouble for Shushan. At the very minimum, Wu Yu was fighting for what he deemed right and had not seen Shushan as his lifelong foe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Mizar Sword Immortal refused to accept anything. He was infuriated and blurted out, "Senior Brother Ursae, are you still standing on the side of our Shushan Immortal Sect?!" The Ursae Sword Immortal raised an eyebrow. He was composed and wasn't shrouded by anger as he replied, "When I spilled blood for Shushan, you weren't even born! What do you think?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Mizar Sword Immortal, who was blinded by fury, was truly incomparable to the Ursae Sword Immortal. Therefore, he was at a loss of words after a short exchange. What the Ursae Sword Immortal had said made him seem like he was giving in, and the sword cultivators of Shushan were rather more fond of the vulgar response from the Mizar Sword Immortal. However, those with brains and those with clear minds understood that the Ursae Sword Immortal had made the right decision. Wu Yu was no longer the same as before. If they were to pursue him due to a personal feud, Shushan wouldn't stand to gain anything at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The had to admit the defeat of the two geniuses today.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Enough." Suddenly, a soft and gentle voice reverberated from beyond the sky. When Wu Yu lifted his head, he saw five figures descending from the Shushan Immortal Domain. Upon the sight of the five figures, the Shushan disciples were agitated. They all dropped down to one knee right away and greeted them. "Greetings, Seven Immortals of Shushan!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first gathering of the Seven Immortals of Shushan in a very long time! When Wu Yu first arrived at Shushan, he would have never expected the Seven Immortals of Shushan to appear at the same time because of him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Seven Immortals of Shushan was named after the Big Dipper constellation based on their strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strongest was Dubhe Sword Immortal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After which, the order was the Merak Sword Immortal, the Ursae Sword Immortal, the Megrez Sword Immortal, the Alioth Sword Immortal, the Mizar Sword Immortal, and the Alkaid Sword Immortal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among which, five were men and two were women.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two women were the strongest Dubhe Sword Immortal and the weakest Alkaid Sword Immortal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it would appear that the Alkaid Sword Immortal was a little older than the Dubhe Sword Immortal. Wu Yu had heard that the Dubhe Sword Immortal was the strongest in Shushan, but was actually only slightly older than the Mizar Sword Immortal. She was one of the most stunning geniuses of Shushan 200 years ago. During her glory days, her fame easily outshined that of the Mizar Sword Immortal, Nangong Xuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu’s attention had now fallen on the Dubhe Sword Immortal. What was surprising was that the Dubhe Sword Immortal was a young girl in a plain-looking robe. Her black and long hair rested on her shoulders and didn't appear exceptionally stunning. However, she looked demure and composed. When looking at her, one would feel at ease. Her dark and deep eyes were clean and gave off a sense of having a clear dao. Among the Seven Immortals of Shushan, she might be the least eye-catching. In fact, she seemed out of place when standing among them. However, one would find her to be at a higher cultivation level than the rest if one would to have a longer look at her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, even the Imperial General had a more solemn look when she appeared. There was also a tinge of respect gleaming in the Imperial General's eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the other Sword Immortals, the Merak Sword Immortal looked a little older than the Ursae Sword Immortal. He had a slightly hunched back, a head of white hair, and a face of wrinkles. He used a walking stick and was the oldest of the Seven Immortals of Shushan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the Megrez Sword Immortal and the Alioth Sword Immortal, they were both imposing and outstanding middle-aged sword cultivators and appeared to be more mature than the Mizar Sword Immortal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Alkaid Sword Immortal was a beautiful and bright girl. Her outfit was elegant and attractive. At the first look, she would appear to be even more attractive than the Dubhe Sword Immortal. However, beside the simple yet elegant demeanor of the Dubhe Sword Immortal, even her elegance would fade a little after a few more looks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, with the Dubhe Sword Immortal leading the way, all Seven Immortals of Shushan were present. A lineup like this was a view that might not happen even in 1,000 years. Therefore, the Shushan disciples were unprecedentedly agitated. In fact, they had even put aside the grievances they had after Beishan Mo had died in battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Dubhe Sword Immortal. It's been a long time since we last met. How have you been doing?" The Imperial General clasped his right fist with his left palm as he greeted her. He wasn't as demanding as before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other Sword Immortals took the Dubhe Sword Immortal as their leader. When the Dubhe Sword Immortal nodded at the Imperial General, the Mizar Sword Immortal was eager to speak. However, Dubhe Sword Immortal gestured for him to remain silent. After which, she turned to the Imperial General and said, "We are fully aware of what has happened today. With regard to this defeat, Shushan will accept it fully. Wu Yu was a disciple of our Shushan but left due to other reasons. Now that we have suffered the consequences, our Shushan will have to face them directly. From here onwards, Shushan won't pursue Wu Yu for this matter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was her decision and likely the outcome after discussing with the other Sword Immortals. It would appear that the other Shushan Sword Immortals were more rational than the Mizar Sword Immortal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As such, the Mizar Sword Immortal was in an embarrassing situation. Naturally, a decision like this would be a bitter pill for the Shushan disciples to swallow. They would naturally hope that the Seven Immortals of Shushan would lead the million-strong crowd of sword cultivators to demand an explanation so as to vent their frustration.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they would undoubtedly be drawing trouble to themselves if they were to taunt Yan Huang Imperial City without reason being on their side.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that the Dubhe Sword Immortal had given him a platform to end this matter, the Imperial General said, "We are just helping Wu Yu on this matter. It is great that the Dubhe Sword Immortal is so understanding."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He also stopped when the circumstances were right for him. After all, he might be able to ignore the Mizar Sword Immortal. However, he still had to be reserved before a unique lady like the Dubhe Sword Immortal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Dubhe Sword Immortal looked worried and remarked solemnly, "The quarrel of young disciples is a small matter. As for how it will end, it will be their own fate. Only by living on can one become a hero in the future. Therefore, Wu Yu did nothing wrong today. However, there's a major core matter that concerns everyone on the Dong Sheng Divine Continent. With regards to this matter, we will have to handle it together with Yan Huang Imperial City."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon hearing this, everyone was taken aback, including the Imperial General.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The crowd was astonished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dubhe Sword Immortal continued, "I have just received news that Emperor Yan's Hall in the Eastern Seas is leading all the ghostly cultivators in the Eastern Seas to attack the eastern borders. Recent news that reached us have reported the deaths of countless mortals, and various sects have been annihilated."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The worry in her eyes wasn't without a reason.&nbsp;</span></p>
